[{"title": "Adventures in Twitter fiction", "duration": "715", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_fitzgerald_adventures_in_twitter_fiction", "transcript": "So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools. And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.But I want to start and go back to the 1930s. Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. And from those single points emanated stories. Some of them were familiar stories. Some of them were new stories. And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium. Think about episodes that happened live on radio.Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format. And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world. This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster. We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting. And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods. The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces. One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called \"Wool.\" And he actually says that he didn't intend for \"Wool\" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more. He gave them \"Wool 2,\" which was a little bit longer than the first one, \"Wool 3,\" which was even longer, culminating in \"Wool 5,\" which was a 60,000-word novel. I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books. He was able to write and publish in relatively short order. There was no mediator between him and the audience. It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. So this whole project was an experiment. It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format. And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called \"Black Box.\" It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind. Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created. Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit. Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker. Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account. I think that's pretty exciting: tune-in literary fiction. The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it. You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them. They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called \"Evidence.\" It began with this tweet: \"On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel.\" It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m. when this woman falls to her death. These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives. One reviewer called Elliott's story \"Twitter fiction done right,\" because she did. She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time. Interestingly, though, it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism. It was also Twitter as a production mechanism. Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs. She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line. I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world. Things like Invisible Obama or the famous \"binders full of women\" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of \"West Wing\" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in \"The West Wing,\" including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode. (Laughter)All of these are rapid iterations on a theme. They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium. You look at something like \"West Wing\" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world. They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress. Keep in mind, they're all Democrats. And they engage with the real world. They respond to it. So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account. It was Mayor Emanuel. It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department. This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went. It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird. And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is \u2014 it didn't actually happen. I double checked the newspapers.And then, very interestingly, it came to an end. This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account. It ended, a true narrative conclusion. And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan \u2014 it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show. Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show. Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird. And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things. He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text. I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, \"eppasod,\" presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new. There is a new \"eppasod\" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way. And I think this is an interesting experiment in format. Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well. RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day. And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news. In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes. I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks. They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1841,

he actually says that he didn't intend\n\n00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:56.528\nfor \"Wool\" to become a series,\n\n00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:59.154\nbut that the audience loved the first story so much\n\n00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:01.565\nthey demanded more, and so he gave them more.\n\n00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:05.069\nHe gave them \"Wool 2,\" which was a little bit longer than the first one,\n\n00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.063\n\"Wool 3,\" which was even longer,\n\n00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:08.853\nculminating in \"Wool 5,\"\n\n00:03:08.853 --> 00:03:11.694\nwhich was a 60,000-word novel.\n\n00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:15.679\nI think Howey was able to do all of this because\n\n00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.622\nhe had the quick feedback system of e-books.\n\n00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.424\nHe was able to write and publish\n\n00:03:20.424 --> 00:03:22.013\nin relatively short order.\n\n00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:25.110\nThere was no mediator between him and the audience.\n\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.916\nIt was just him directly connected with his audience\n\n00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.065\nand building on the feedback and enthusiasm\n\n00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:31.886\nthat they were giving him.\n\n00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:33.771\nSo this whole project was an experiment.\n\n00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:35.878\nIt started with the one short story,\n\n00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:38.007\nand I think the experimentation actually became\n\n00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:40.335\na part of Howey's format.\n\n00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:43.574\nAnd that's something that this medium enabled,\n\n00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:47.751\nwas experimentation being a part of the format itself.\n\n00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:50.922\nThis is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan\n\n00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:52.370\ncalled \"Black Box.\"\n\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.877\nIt was originally written\n\n00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:55.558\nspecifically with Twitter in mind.\n\n00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:57.867\nEgan convinced The New Yorker\n\n00:03:57.867 --> 00:04:00.289\nto start a New Yorker fiction account\n\n00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.106\nfrom which they could tweet\n\n00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.910\nall of these lines that she created.\n\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.357\nNow Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.\n\n00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.198\nEgan mocked that up just writing manually\n\n00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:13.114\nin this storyboard sketchbook,\n\n00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:16.101\nused the physical space constraints\n\n00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:17.610\nof those storyboard squares\n\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.411\nto write each individual tweet,\n\n00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:22.350\nand those tweets ended up becoming\n\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.038\nover 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.\n\n00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:29.808\nEvery night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in\n\n00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:33.376\nto a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.\n\n00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:34.920\nI think that's pretty exciting:\n\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.426\ntune-in literary fiction.\n\n00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:40.487\nThe experience of Egan's story, of course,\n\n00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:43.536\nlike anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.\n\n00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:45.075\nYou could scroll back through it,\n\n00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:47.958\nbut interestingly, if you were watching it live,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.589\nthere was this suspense that built\n\n00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.106\nbecause the actual tweets,\n\n00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:55.409\nyou had no control over when you would read them.\n\n00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.849\nThey were coming at a pretty regular clip,\n\n00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.227\nbut as the story was building,\n\n00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:03.470\nnormally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,\n\n00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.781\nbut in this case, The New Yorker did,\n\n00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:08.951\nand they were sending you bit by bit by bit,\n\n00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.233\nand you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.\n\n00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:15.304\nAnother great example of fiction\n\n00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:17.348\nand the short story on Twitter,\n\n00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:20.771\nElliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called \"Evidence.\"\n\n00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:23.401\nIt began with this tweet: \"On November 28\n\n00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.552\nat 10:13 p.m.,\n\n00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:27.627\na woman identified as Miranda Brown,\n\n00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.457\n44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death\n\n00:05:30.457 --> 00:05:32.823\nfrom the roof of a Manhattan hotel.\"\n\n00:05:32.823 --> 00:05:34.553\nIt begins in Elliott's voice,\n\n00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:36.294\nbut then Elliott's voice recedes,\n\n00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.676\nand we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,\n\n00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:42.775\ncharacters that Elliott created on Twitter\n\n00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.504\nspecifically to tell this story,\n\n00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:47.118\na story from multiple perspectives\n\n00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:50.243\nleading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.\n\n00:05:50.243 --> 00:05:52.521\nwhen this woman falls to her death.\n\n00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:55.625\nThese three characters brought an authentic vision\n\n00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.347\nfrom multiple perspectives.\n\n00:05:57.347 --> 00:05:59.673\nOne reviewer called Elliott's story\n\n00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:02.563\n\"Twitter fiction done right,\" because she did.\n\n00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:04.291\nShe captured that voice\n\n00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:07.479\nand she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.\n\n00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.178\nInterestingly, though, it wasn't just\n\n00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:12.342\nTwitter as a distribution mechanism.\n\n00:06:12.342 --> 00:06:14.486\nIt was also Twitter as a production mechanism.\n\n00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:15.730\nElliott told me later\n\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.777\nshe wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.\n\n00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:23.580\nShe laid on the couch and just went back and forth\n\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.429\nbetween different characters\n\n00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.042\ntweeting out each line, line by line.\n\n00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.795\nI think that this kind of spontaneous creation\n\n00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:33.311\nof what was coming out of the characters' voices\n\n00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:36.420\nreally lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,\n\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.098\nbut also to this format that she had created\n\n00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:43.711\nof multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.\n\n00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:46.438\nAs you begin to play with flexible identity online,\n\n00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:47.735\nit gets even more interesting\n\n00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.680\nas you start to interact with the real world.\n\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.584\nThings like Invisible Obama\n\n00:06:51.584 --> 00:06:53.825\nor the famous \"binders full of women\"\n\n00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.371\nthat came up during the 2012 election cycle,\n\n00:06:56.371 --> 00:07:00.542\nor even the fan fiction universe of \"West Wing\" Twitter\n\n00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:02.652\nin which you have all of these accounts\n\n00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:05.628\nfor every single one of the characters in \"The West Wing,\"\n\n00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:09.531\nincluding the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window\n\n00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:13.667\nin one single episode. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.803\nAll of these are rapid iterations on a theme.\n\n00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.119\nThey are creative people experimenting\n\n00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:22.175\nwith the bounds of what is possible in this medium.\n\n00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.928\nYou look at something like \"West Wing\" Twitter,\n\n00:07:23.928 --> 00:07:26.328\nin which you have these fictional characters\n\n00:07:26.328 --> 00:07:28.286\nthat engage with the real world.\n\n00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.078\nThey comment on politics,\n\n00:07:30.078 --> 00:07:34.612\nthey cry out against the evils of Congress.\n\n00:07:34.612 --> 00:07:36.396\nKeep in mind, they're all Democrats.\n\n00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:39.716\nAnd they engage with the real world.\n\n00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:41.574\nThey respond to it.\n\n00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:43.719\nSo once you take flexible identity,\n\n00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.418\nanonymity, engagement with the real world,\n\n00:07:46.418 --> 00:07:49.589\nand you move beyond simple homage or parody\n\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.178\nand you put these tools to work in telling a story,\n\n00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:55.061\nthat's when things get really interesting.\n\n00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:57.870\nSo during the Chicago mayoral election\n\n00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.438\nthere was a parody account.\n\n00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.852\nIt was Mayor Emanuel.\n\n00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:04.318\nIt gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,\n\n00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:07.638\nparticularly in the expletive department.\n\n00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:09.717\nThis foul-mouthed account\n\n00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:13.604\nfollowed the daily activities of the race,\n\n00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:15.284\nproviding commentary as it went.\n\n00:08:15.284 --> 00:08:17.765\nIt followed all of the natural tropes\n\n00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:20.147\nof a good, solid Twitter parody account,\n\n00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:23.829\nbut then started to get weird.\n\n00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:27.202\nAnd as it progressed, it moved from this commentary\n\n00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:32.470\nto a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic\n\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.558\nin which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,\n\n00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:39.715\nengages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,\n\n00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:42.328\nwhich is -- it didn't actually happen.\n\n00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:45.746\nI double checked the newspapers.\n\n00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:49.289\nAnd then, very interestingly, it came to an end.\n\n00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:51.288\nThis is something that doesn't usually happen\n\n00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:52.749\nwith a Twitter parody account.\n\n00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:56.478\nIt ended, a true narrative conclusion.\n\n00:08:56.478 --> 00:08:59.700\nAnd so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,\n\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.035\nwho was completely anonymous this whole time,\n\n00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:05.733\nI think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him\n\n00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.317\nto turn this into a book,\n\n00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:10.690\nbecause it was a narrative format in the end,\n\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.251\nand I think that turning it into a book\n\n00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:16.949\nis representative of this idea that he had created something new\n\n00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:20.575\nthat needed to be translated into previous formats.\n\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:22.668\nOne of my favorite examples\n\n00:09:22.668 --> 00:09:24.664\nof something that's happening on Twitter right now,\n\n00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:29.440\nactually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.\n\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.872\nCrimer Show tells the story\n\n00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:34.613\nof a supercriminal and a hapless detective\n\n00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:38.298\nthat face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,\n\n00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:40.720\nwith all of the tropes of a television show.\n\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.257\nCrimer Show's creator has said that\n\n00:09:42.257 --> 00:09:47.249\nit is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,\n\n00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:50.107\nbut, man, is it weird.\n\n00:09:50.107 --> 00:09:52.078\nAnd there are all these times where Crimer,\n\n00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:54.507\nthe supercriminal, does all of these TV things.\n\n00:09:54.507 --> 00:09:56.759\nHe's always taking off his sunglasses\n\n00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.727\nor turning to the camera,\n\n00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:02.167\nbut these things just happen in text.\n\n00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.001\nI think borrowing all of these tropes from television\n\n00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:08.753\nand additionally presenting each Crimer Show\n\n00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:13.986\nas an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, \"eppasod,\"\n\n00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:16.035\npresenting them as episodes\n\n00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:19.065\nreally, it creates something new.\n\n00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:22.654\nThere is a new \"eppasod\" of Crimer Show\n\n00:10:22.654 --> 00:10:24.778\non Twitter pretty much every day,\n\n00:10:24.778 --> 00:10:26.390\nand they're archived that way.\n\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.171\nAnd I think this is an interesting experiment in format.\n\n00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:31.455\nSomething totally new has been created here\n\n00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:34.991\nout of parodying something on television.\n\n00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:37.831\nI think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,\n\n00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.598\nthere are a lot of really excellent examples as well.\n\n00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.547\nRealTimeWWII is an account\n\n00:10:42.547 --> 00:10:46.610\nthat documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago\n\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.979\nin exceptional detail, as if\n\n00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:51.708\nyou were reading the news reports from that day.\n\n00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.463\nAnd the author Teju Cole has done\n\n00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:56.874\na lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist\n\n00:10:56.874 --> 00:10:58.502\non events of the news.\n\n00:10:58.502 --> 00:11:02.945\nIn this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.\n\n00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:05.545\nI think that in both of these examples,\n\n00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:07.186\nyou're beginning to see ways in which\n\n00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:10.010\npeople are telling stories with nonfiction content\n\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.919\nthat can be built into new types\n\n00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:15.480\nof fictional storytelling.\n\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.042\nSo with real-time storytelling,\n\n00:11:18.042 --> 00:11:20.571\nblurring the lines between fact and fiction,\n\n00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:22.648\nthe real world and the digital world,\n\n00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:26.430\nflexible identity, anonymity,\n\n00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.951\nthese are all tools that we have accessible to us,\n\n00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:31.843\nand I think that they're just the building blocks.\n\n00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:34.481\nThey are the bits that we use\n\n00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:37.118\nto create the structures, the frames,\n\n00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:40.216\nthat then become our settlements on this\n\n00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:42.976\nwide open frontier for creative experimentation.\n\n00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:44.427\nThank you.\n\n00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:49.181\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The walkable city", "duration": "1016", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_the_walkable_city", "transcript": "So I'm a city planner, an urban designer, former arts advocate, trained in architecture and art history, and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient, how America can be healthier, and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum, but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history, in some places, not all, of American ideas being appropriated, being emulated, for better or for worse, around the world.And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use, and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas-belching, time-wasting and life-threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to, most Americans, in fact, need, just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know, we say, half the world is living in cities. Well, in America, that living in cities, for many of them, they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for, and to do, is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists, the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today.When I was growing up in the '70s, the typical American spent one tenth of their income, American family, on transportation. Since then, we've doubled the number of roads in America, and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families, which are defined as earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing, slightly more, because of this phenomenon called \"drive till you qualify,\" finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs, so that they're locked in this, two, three hours, four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods, for example, in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up; they were decimated. And in fact, these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage, it goes underwater, and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities? And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland, Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl, they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads, removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic, they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways, they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities, which seems like a lot of money, but it was spent over about 30 years, so two million dollars a year \u2014 not that much \u2014 and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live, and their vehicle-miles traveled per day, the amount that each person drives, actually peaked in 1996, has been dropping ever since, and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those 11 minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region.So if they're not spending that money on driving \u2014 and by the way, 85 percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy \u2014 if they're not spending that money on driving, what are they spending it on? Well, Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita, the most independent bookstores per capita, the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it makes you glad they're driving less.(Laughter)But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes, and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story, which isn't part of this calculus, which is that young, educated people have been moving to Portland in droves, so that between the last two censuses, they had a 50-percent increase in college-educated millennials, which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable, but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster, or an aerospace cluster, but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship, 64 percent of whom decide first where they want to live, then they move there, then they look for a job, they will come to your city.The health argument is a scary one, and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then, back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese, and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty-five percent of young men and 40 percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control, fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis, and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet, and we know that diet impacts weight, and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity, and how inactivity born of our landscape, inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk, is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies, one in Britain called \"Gluttony versus sloth\" that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity, and found a much higher, stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at, in this case, the aptly-named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear, held their diet steady, and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight, some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work, they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving, and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting, on average, two hours more per day than those who didn't.So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity, but even more, we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city, or where in your city do you live? In San Diego, they used Walk Score \u2014 Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is \u2014 they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood, you were 35 percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood, you were 60 percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health, particularly as in America, the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods \"obesageneric.\" I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.Now that's one thing, of course. Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma, three times what it was in the '90s, and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes, and the amount that people are driving in your city, your urban VMT, is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city.And then finally, in terms of driving, there's the issue of the single-largest killer of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers of all people, is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact, here in America, 12 people out of every 100,000 die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000. It's Japan, it's four per 100,000. Do you know where it's three per 100,000? New York City. San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing. Oh, so cities make us safer because we're driving less? Tulsa: 14 per 100,000. Orlando: 20 per 100,000. It's not whether you're in the city or not, it's how is your city designed? Was it designed around cars or around people? Because if your city is designed around cars, it's really good at smashing them into each other.That's part of a much larger health argument.Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating, because the environmentalists turned on a dime about 10 years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti-city movement from Jefferson on.\"Cities are pestilential to the health, to the liberties, to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities, as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.\"He apparently had a sense of humor.And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental, we move into the country, we commune with nature, we build suburbs. But, of course, we've seen what that does.The carbon mapping of America, where is the CO2 being emitted, for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile, any carbon map of the U.S., it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S., hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs, dark, peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said, you know, is that the right way to measure CO2? There are only so many people in this country at any given time, and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said, let's measure CO2 per household, and when they did that, the maps just flipped, coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs, and red hot in these exurban \"drive till you qualify\" neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift, and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature, the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it, move to a city, and the denser the better, and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s, consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course, we can do better. Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously, we can do better, and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way, and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets, on accessorizing \u2014 What can I add to my house, what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable? \u2014 has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C., and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system, solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets, bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high-tech stove apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations \u2014 That's what they said in the brochure. (Laughter) All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers, and you should do the same thing, but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week.And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a \"lifestyle choice.\" You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid, that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more, something that would be better than what we have right now?Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings, it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to 10 criteria that they believe add up to quality of life: health, economics, education, housing, you name it. There's six more. Short talk.(Laughter)And it's very interesting to see that the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu, number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt, the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta, these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better? The Canadian cities like Vancouver, where again, they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German, like Dusseldorf or Vienna, where they're burning, again, half as much fuel. And you see this alignment, this strange alignment.Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life? I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life, and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability, which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America, we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway, then these two problems would seem to share the same solution, which is to make our cities more walkable.Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done, it has been done, and it's being done now in more than a few cities, around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill, who put it this way: \"The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.\" (Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)",

arts advocate,\n\n00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:23.341\ntrained in architecture and art history,\n\n00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.475\nand I want to talk to you today not about design\n\n00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.911\nbut about America\n\n00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:33.116\nand how America can be more economically resilient,\n\n00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.441\nhow America can be healthier,\n\n00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.094\nand how America can be\n\n00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:39.712\nmore environmentally sustainable.\n\n00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:42.130\nAnd I realize this is a global forum,\n\n00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.199\nbut I think I need to talk about America\n\n00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.782\nbecause there is a history,\n\n00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:47.469\nin some places, not all,\n\n00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.919\nof American ideas being appropriated,\n\n00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.451\nbeing emulated, for better or for worse,\n\n00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.792\naround the world.\n\n00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:55.943\nAnd the worst idea we've ever had\n\n00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:58.310\nis suburban sprawl.\n\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.681\nIt's being emulated in many places as we speak.\n\n00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.344\nBy suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization\n\n00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:06.748\nof the landscape and the creation of the landscape\n\n00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:11.084\naround the requirement of automobile use,\n\n00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:13.727\nand that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom\n\n00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:17.478\nhas become a gas-belching,\n\n00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:20.078\ntime-wasting and life-threatening\n\n00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:21.511\nprosthetic device\n\n00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.147\nthat many of us need just to,\n\n00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:24.735\nmost Americans, in fact, need,\n\n00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:27.055\njust to live their daily lives.\n\n00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:28.639\nAnd there's an alternative.\n\n00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.227\nYou know, we say, half the world is living in cities.\n\n00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.168\nWell, in America, that living in cities,\n\n00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:33.826\nfor many of them, they're living in cities still\n\n00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.092\nwhere they're dependent on that automobile.\n\n00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:39.071\nAnd what I work for, and to do,\n\n00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.757\nis to make our cities more walkable.\n\n00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.280\nBut I can't give design arguments for that\n\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.969\nthat will have as much impact\n\n00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.885\nas the arguments that I've learned\n\n00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.402\nfrom the economists, the epidemiologists\n\n00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.118\nand the environmentalists.\n\n00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:54.379\nSo these are the three arguments that I'm going\n\n00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.490\nto give you quickly today.\n\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.974\nWhen I was growing up in the '70s,\n\n00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:02.609\nthe typical American spent one tenth of their income,\n\n00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.848\nAmerican family, on transportation.\n\n00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:08.433\nSince then, we've doubled the number of roads\n\n00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:11.210\nin America, and we now spend one fifth\n\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.871\nof our income on transportation.\n\n00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.932\nWorking families, which are defined as\n\n00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:17.856\nearning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars\n\n00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:19.815\na year in America\n\n00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.319\nare spending more now on transportation\n\n00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.557\nthan on housing, slightly more,\n\n00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:27.790\nbecause of this phenomenon called \"drive till you qualify,\"\n\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.208\nfinding homes further and further and further\n\n00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.135\nfrom the city centers and from their jobs,\n\n00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.660\nso that they're locked in this, two, three hours,\n\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.857\nfour hours a day of commuting.\n\n00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.331\nAnd these are the neighborhoods, for example,\n\n00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.753\nin the Central Valley of California\n\n00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:44.860\nthat weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst\n\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.082\nand when the price of gas went up;\n\n00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.350\nthey were decimated.\n\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.616\nAnd in fact, these are many\n\n00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:53.219\nof the half-vacant communities that you see today.\n\n00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.400\nImagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,\n\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.473\nit goes underwater, and you have to pay\n\n00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:02.338\ntwice as much for all the driving that you're doing.\n\n00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:05.058\nSo we know what it's done to our society\n\n00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:07.389\nand all the extra work we have to do\n\n00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.158\nto support our cars.\n\n00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:10.890\nWhat happens when a city decides\n\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.164\nit's going to set other priorities?\n\n00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.136\nAnd probably the best example we have here\n\n00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:17.547\nin America is Portland, Oregon.\n\n00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.886\nPortland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s\n\n00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:22.584\nthat began to distinguish it\n\n00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:25.120\nfrom almost every other American city.\n\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.238\nWhile most other cities were growing\n\n00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:30.373\nan undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,\n\n00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:33.048\nthey instituted an urban growth boundary.\n\n00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:35.218\nWhile most cities were reaming out their roads,\n\n00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.463\nremoving parallel parking and trees\n\n00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:39.664\nin order to flow more traffic,\n\n00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:43.397\nthey instituted a skinny streets program.\n\n00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:47.311\nAnd while most cities were investing in more roads\n\n00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:50.220\nand more highways, they actually invested\n\n00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.697\nin bicycling and in walking.\n\n00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:56.762\nAnd they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,\n\n00:03:56.762 --> 00:03:58.195\nwhich seems like a lot of money,\n\n00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.711\nbut it was spent over about 30 years,\n\n00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:03.080\nso two million dollars a year -- not that much --\n\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.405\nand half the price of the one cloverleaf\n\n00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:08.224\nthat they decided to rebuild in that city.\n\n00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.193\nThese changes and others like them changed\n\n00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.155\nthe way that Portlanders live,\n\n00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.316\nand their vehicle-miles traveled per day,\n\n00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:15.875\nthe amount that each person drives,\n\n00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.188\nactually peaked in 1996,\n\n00:04:18.188 --> 00:04:20.289\nhas been dropping ever since,\n\n00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.353\nand they now drive 20 percent less\n\n00:04:22.353 --> 00:04:23.786\nthan the rest of the country.\n\n00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:26.542\nThe typical Portland citizen drives\n\n00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:30.510\nfour miles less, and 11 minutes less per day\n\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.832\nthan they did before.\n\n00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:34.819\nThe economist Joe Cortright did the math\n\n00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.337\nand he found out that those four miles\n\n00:04:36.337 --> 00:04:37.769\nplus those 11 minutes\n\n00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:39.691\nadds up to fully three and a half percent\n\n00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:42.221\nof all income earned in the region.\n\n00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.097\nSo if they're not spending that money on driving --\n\n00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:45.710\nand by the way, 85 percent of the money\n\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.304\nwe spend on driving leaves the local economy --\n\n00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:50.179\nif they're not spending that money on driving,\n\n00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:51.950\nwhat are they spending it on?\n\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.627\nWell, Portland is reputed to have\n\n00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.549\nthe most roof racks per capita,\n\n00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:59.389\nthe most independent bookstores per capita,\n\n00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.633\nthe most strip clubs per capita.\n\n00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:05.269\nThese are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations\n\n00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:06.908\nof a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders\n\n00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:10.106\nspend a lot more on recreation of all kinds\n\n00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:12.132\nthan the rest of America.\n\n00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:14.447\nActually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol\n\n00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:15.787\nthan most other states,\n\n00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:17.352\nwhich may be a good thing or a bad thing,\n\n00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:19.351\nbut it makes you glad they're driving less.\n\n00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.724\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:25.060\nBut actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,\n\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.603\nand home investment is about as local\n\n00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:29.741\nan investment as you can get.\n\n00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:31.152\nBut there's a whole other Portland story,\n\n00:05:31.152 --> 00:05:32.697\nwhich isn't part of this calculus,\n\n00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:35.584\nwhich is that young, educated people\n\n00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:38.036\nhave been moving to Portland in droves,\n\n00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:40.554\nso that between the last two censuses,\n\n00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:42.836\nthey had a 50-percent increase\n\n00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:44.700\nin college-educated millennials,\n\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.884\nwhich is five times what you saw anywhere else\n\n00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:50.160\nin the country, or, I should say, of the national average.\n\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.473\nSo on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents\n\n00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:57.053\nby being more walkable and more bikeable,\n\n00:05:57.053 --> 00:05:59.888\nbut on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city\n\n00:05:59.888 --> 00:06:02.706\nthat people want to be in these days.\n\n00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:04.099\nSo the best economic strategy\n\n00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.502\nyou can have as a city\n\n00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:09.216\nis not the old way of trying to attract corporations\n\n00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:11.548\nand trying to have a biotech cluster\n\n00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:13.642\nor a medical cluster,\n\n00:06:13.642 --> 00:06:15.051\nor an aerospace cluster,\n\n00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:18.151\nbut to become a place where people want to be.\n\n00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:21.629\nAnd millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,\n\n00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.470\n64 percent of whom decide first\n\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.749\nwhere they want to live,\n\n00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:27.765\nthen they move there, then they look for a job,\n\n00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:30.710\nthey will come to your city.\n\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.571\nThe health argument is a scary one,\n\n00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:36.065\nand you've probably heard part of this argument before.\n\n00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.032\nAgain, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,\n\n00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:42.142\nback in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.\n\n00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:45.741\nNow one out of three Americans is obese,\n\n00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:49.608\nand a second third of the population is overweight.\n\n00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:51.487\nTwenty-five percent of young men\n\n00:06:51.487 --> 00:06:53.408\nand 40 percent of young women are too heavy\n\n00:06:53.408 --> 00:06:57.059\nto enlist in our own military forces.\n\n00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.437\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control,\n\n00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:03.234\nfully one third of all children born after 2000\n\n00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:04.934\nwill get diabetes.\n\n00:07:04.934 --> 00:07:06.907\nWe have the first generation of children in America\n\n00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:10.777\nwho are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.\n\n00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.988\nI believe that this American healthcare crisis\n\n00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:14.426\nthat we've all heard about\n\n00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:17.042\nis an urban design crisis,\n\n00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.854\nand that the design of our cities lies at the cure.\n\n00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:22.419\nBecause we've talked a long time about diet,\n\n00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.173\nand we know that diet impacts weight,\n\n00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:27.485\nand weight of course impacts health.\n\n00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:30.256\nBut we've only started talking about inactivity,\n\n00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:33.448\nand how inactivity born of our landscape,\n\n00:07:33.448 --> 00:07:35.778\ninactivity that comes from the fact that we live\n\n00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:37.647\nin a place where there is no longer any such thing\n\n00:07:37.647 --> 00:07:41.243\nas a useful walk, is driving our weight up.\n\n00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:42.817\nAnd we finally have the studies,\n\n00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:45.503\none in Britain called \"Gluttony versus sloth\"\n\n00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:48.204\nthat tracked weight against diet\n\n00:07:48.204 --> 00:07:50.109\nand tracked weight against inactivity,\n\n00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:52.812\nand found a much higher, stronger correlation\n\n00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:54.860\nbetween the latter two.\n\n00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.877\nDr. James Levine at, in this case,\n\n00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:59.070\nthe aptly-named Mayo Clinic\n\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.609\nput his test subjects in electronic underwear,\n\n00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.602\nheld their diet steady,\n\n00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:07.606\nand then started pumping the calories in.\n\n00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:09.103\nSome people gained weight,\n\n00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:10.480\nsome people didn't gain weight.\n\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.946\nExpecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,\n\n00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:15.650\nthey were shocked to learn that the only difference\n\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.532\nbetween the subjects that they could figure out\n\n00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:19.416\nwas the amount they were moving,\n\n00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.056\nand that in fact those who gained weight\n\n00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:24.808\nwere sitting, on average, two hours more per day\n\n00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:26.124\nthan those who didn't.\n\n00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:28.067\nSo we have these studies that tie\n\n00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:30.381\nweight to inactivity, but even more,\n\n00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.896\nwe now have studies that tie weight to where you live.\n\n00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:34.529\nDo you live in a more walkable city\n\n00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:35.965\nor do you live in a less walkable city,\n\n00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:37.889\nor where in your city do you live?\n\n00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:40.554\nIn San Diego, they used Walk Score --\n\n00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.911\nWalk Score rates every address in America\n\n00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:44.550\nand soon the world\n\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.939\nin terms of how walkable it is --\n\n00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:49.822\nthey used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods\n\n00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:51.515\nand less walkable neighborhoods.\n\n00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:54.317\nWell guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,\n\n00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:56.588\nyou were 35 percent likely to be overweight.\n\n00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.911\nIf you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,\n\n00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:01.118\nyou were 60 percent likely to be overweight.\n\n00:09:01.118 --> 00:09:02.956\nSo we have study after study now\n\n00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:05.011\nthat's tying where you live\n\n00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.398\nto your health, particularly as in America,\n\n00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:09.528\nthe biggest health crisis we have is this one\n\n00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:14.252\nthat's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.\n\n00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:15.975\nAnd I learned a new word last week.\n\n00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:19.605\nThey call these neighborhoods \"obesageneric.\"\n\n00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:22.836\nI may have that wrong, but you get the idea.\n\n00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:24.603\nNow that's one thing, of course.\n\n00:09:24.603 --> 00:09:27.078\nBriefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic\n\n00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:28.205\nin this country.\n\n00:09:28.205 --> 00:09:29.863\nYou probably haven't thought that much about it.\n\n00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:32.584\nFourteen Americans die each day from asthma,\n\n00:09:32.584 --> 00:09:35.489\nthree times what it was in the '90s,\n\n00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:38.380\nand it's almost all coming from car exhaust.\n\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.392\nAmerican pollution does not come\n\n00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:42.700\nfrom factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,\n\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.957\nand the amount that people are driving in your city,\n\n00:09:44.957 --> 00:09:47.405\nyour urban VMT, is a good prediction\n\n00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:49.907\nof the asthma problems in your city.\n\n00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:52.122\nAnd then finally, in terms of driving,\n\n00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:55.028\nthere's the issue of the single-largest killer\n\n00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:57.670\nof healthy adults, and one of the largest killers\n\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.764\nof all people, is car crashes.\n\n00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:01.266\nAnd we take car crashes for granted.\n\n00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.101\nWe figure it's a natural risk\n\n00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:04.683\nof being on the road.\n\n00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:07.856\nBut in fact, here in America, 12 people\n\n00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:09.212\nout of every 100,000\n\n00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.310\ndie every year from car crashes.\n\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.779\nWe're pretty safe here.\n\n00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.165\nWell, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.\n\n00:10:15.165 --> 00:10:17.003\nIt's Japan, it's four per 100,000.\n\n00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:19.572\nDo you know where it's three per 100,000?\n\n00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:21.297\nNew York City.\n\n00:10:21.297 --> 00:10:23.953\nSan Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.\n\n00:10:23.953 --> 00:10:26.013\nOh, so cities make us safer\n\n00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:28.182\nbecause we're driving less?\n\n00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:30.601\nTulsa: 14 per 100,000.\n\n00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.842\nOrlando: 20 per 100,000.\n\n00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.559\nIt's not whether you're in the city or not,\n\n00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.245\nit's how is your city designed?\n\n00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:41.077\nWas it designed around cars or around people?\n\n00:10:41.077 --> 00:10:42.847\nBecause if your city is designed around cars,\n\n00:10:42.847 --> 00:10:47.706\nit's really good at smashing them into each other.\n\n00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:51.441\nThat's part of a much larger health argument.\n\n00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:53.710\nFinally, the environmental argument is fascinating,\n\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.951\nbecause the environmentalists turned on a dime\n\n00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:57.470\nabout 10 years ago.\n\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.946\nThe environmental movement in America\n\n00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:01.974\nhas historically been an anti-city movement\n\n00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:03.485\nfrom Jefferson on.\n\n00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:05.840\n\"Cities are pestilential to the health,\n\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.831\nto the liberties, to the morals of man.\n\n00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:09.941\nIf we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,\n\n00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:11.857\nas they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt\n\n00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:13.272\nas they are in Europe\n\n00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.934\nand take to eating one another as they do there.\"\n\n00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:18.665\nHe apparently had a sense of humor.\n\n00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:20.718\nAnd then the American environmental movement\n\n00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:22.828\nhas been a classically Arcadian movement.\n\n00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:24.941\nTo become more environmental, we move into the country,\n\n00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:27.609\nwe commune with nature, we build suburbs.\n\n00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:31.632\nBut, of course, we've seen what that does.\n\n00:11:31.632 --> 00:11:33.838\nThe carbon mapping of America,\n\n00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:35.725\nwhere is the CO2 being emitted,\n\n00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:37.654\nfor many years only\n\n00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:40.181\nhammered this argument in more strongly.\n\n00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:43.022\nIf you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,\n\n00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:44.537\nany carbon map of the U.S.,\n\n00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.680\nit looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,\n\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.136\nhottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,\n\n00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:53.704\ndark, peaceful in the countryside.\n\n00:11:53.704 --> 00:11:55.643\nUntil some economists said, you know,\n\n00:11:55.643 --> 00:11:58.089\nis that the right way to measure CO2?\n\n00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:00.075\nThere are only so many people in this country at any given time,\n\n00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:02.162\nand we can choose to live where perhaps\n\n00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:03.801\nwe would have a lighter impact.\n\n00:12:03.801 --> 00:12:06.594\nAnd they said, let's measure CO2 per household,\n\n00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:09.198\nand when they did that, the maps just flipped,\n\n00:12:09.198 --> 00:12:12.217\ncoolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,\n\n00:12:12.217 --> 00:12:14.893\nand red hot in these exurban\n\n00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:17.665\n\"drive till you qualify\" neighborhoods.\n\n00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:19.618\nSo a fundamental shift, and now you have\n\n00:12:19.618 --> 00:12:22.382\nenvironmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser\n\n00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:24.949\nsaying we are a destructive species.\n\n00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:27.115\nIf you love nature, the best thing you can do\n\n00:12:27.115 --> 00:12:29.383\nis stay the heck away from it,\n\n00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:31.937\nmove to a city, and the denser the better,\n\n00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:34.441\nand the denser cities like Manhattan\n\n00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.777\nare the cities that perform the best.\n\n00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:40.926\nSo the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline\n\n00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:45.242\nat the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,\n\n00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:48.716\nconsuming half of the electricity of Dallas.\n\n00:12:48.716 --> 00:12:50.718\nBut of course, we can do better.\n\n00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:53.830\nCanadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.\n\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.924\nEuropean cities consume half as much again.\n\n00:12:57.924 --> 00:13:00.120\nSo obviously, we can do better,\n\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.489\nand we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.\n\n00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:05.935\nMy final argument in this topic is that\n\n00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:09.589\nI think we're trying to be green the wrong way,\n\n00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.765\nand I'm one of many people who believes that\n\n00:13:11.765 --> 00:13:14.837\nthis focus on gadgets,\n\n00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:17.528\non accessorizing --\n\n00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:19.547\nWhat can I add to my house,\n\n00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:21.659\nwhat can I add to what I've already got\n\n00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:24.122\nto make my lifestyle more sustainable? --\n\n00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:26.063\nhas kind of dominated the discussion.\n\n00:13:26.063 --> 00:13:27.917\nSo I'm not immune to this.\n\n00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.452\nMy wife and I built a new house\n\n00:13:29.452 --> 00:13:32.451\non an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,\n\n00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.553\nand we did our best to clear the shelves\n\n00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:36.608\nof the sustainability store.\n\n00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.843\nWe've got the solar photovoltaic system,\n\n00:13:38.843 --> 00:13:41.292\nsolar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,\n\n00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:43.200\nbamboo floors.\n\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.572\nA log burning in my German high-tech stove\n\n00:13:46.572 --> 00:13:49.261\napparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon\n\n00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.942\nto the atmosphere than were it left alone\n\n00:13:50.942 --> 00:13:53.054\nto decompose in the forest.\n\n00:13:53.054 --> 00:13:55.834\nYet all of these innovations --\n\n00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.721\nThat's what they said in the brochure.\n\n00:13:57.721 --> 00:13:58.949\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:01.089\nAll of these innovations together\n\n00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:04.173\ncontribute a fraction of what we contribute\n\n00:14:04.173 --> 00:14:06.078\nby living in a walkable neighborhood\n\n00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:09.849\nthree blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.\n\n00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.048\nWe've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,\n\n00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:13.398\nand you should do the same thing,\n\n00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:15.778\nbut changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers\n\n00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.410\nsaves as much energy in a year\n\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.344\nas moving to a walkable city does in a week.\n\n00:14:20.344 --> 00:14:21.693\nAnd we don't want to have this argument.\n\n00:14:21.693 --> 00:14:23.901\nPoliticians and marketers are afraid\n\n00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:27.634\nof marketing green as a \"lifestyle choice.\"\n\n00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:30.551\nYou don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,\n\n00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:32.412\nthat they have to change their lifestyle.\n\n00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:35.576\nBut what if lifestyle was really about quality of life\n\n00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:38.093\nand about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,\n\n00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:41.424\nsomething that would be better than what we have right now?\n\n00:14:41.424 --> 00:14:43.935\nWell, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,\n\n00:14:43.935 --> 00:14:45.924\nit's called the Mercer Survey.\n\n00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:47.124\nYou may

It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking.So I went to a party. I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie, and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar, there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations. What a gift it was to the eager, young foreign correspondent that I was then. I'd pump him for information, I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write. I talk to him for hours.Only months later, I discover who he really was. He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.\"I don't understand. Soybeans? You told me you were a Fulbright scholar.\"\"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?\"(Laughter)I said, \"You jerk.\" Only jerk wasn't the word I used. I said, \"You could've gotten me fired.\"And he said, \"Let's get married.\" (Laughter) \"Travel the world and have lots of kids.\" So we did.(Laughter)(Applause)And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be. He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history. He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids. We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do.So when we found the cancer, it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other, we believed that, if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough, and we worked hard enough, we could keep him from dying ever.And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding. The surgeon emerged from the surgery. What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: \"We got it all.\" Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type, with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most. And yet, he did not die. Mysteriously, he lived on. He coached Little League for our son. He built a playhouse for our daughter. And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists. I'm looking for a cure.So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months. So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty. It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on. Then another year goes by. Two years go by. More specialists. We take the kids to Italy. We take the kids to Australia.And then more years pass, and the cancer begins to grow. This time, there's new treatments on the horizon. They're exotic. They're experimental. They're going to attack the cancer in new ways. So he enters a clinical trial, and it works. The cancer begins to shrink, and for the third time, we've dodged death.So now I ask you, how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night, sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.? This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying, perhaps tonight.So what do I say when he says, \"What do you want me to do?\"There's another drug out there. It's newer. It's more powerful. He started it just two weeks ago. Perhaps there's still hope ahead.So what do I say?I say, \"Keep him alive if you can.\"And Terence died six days later.So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed. It was an exhilarating fight, and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation. We fought together, we lived together. It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious. It was also an expensive fight. It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: \"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride.\" We never got the chance to say goodbye. We never thought it was the end. We always had hope.So what do we make of all of this?Being a journalist, after Terence died, I wrote a book, \"The Cost Of Hope.\" I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.And what did I discover? Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices. Yet I had that piece of paper. We both did. And they were readily available. I had them right at hand. Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope. I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.Yet we never got to no further hope. Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope. I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way. Right up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally, that I could keep him from dying ever.Now, what do the experts call this? They say it's denial. It's a strong word, isn't it? Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through.And I hear the medical professionals say, \"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial. The family won't listen to reason. They're in denial. How can they insist on this treatment at the end? It's so clear, yet they're in denial.\"Now, I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking. It's not just families either. The medical professionals too, you out there, you're in denial too. You want to help. You want to fix. You want to do. You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.I saw it firsthand. Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, \"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.\" Days before he died.Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, \"You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal.\"So what the experts call \"denial,\" I call \"hope,\" and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design. You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human. It's not a bug. It's a feature.(Laughter)So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion. It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it. Maybe I wanted to believe it. And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too. Giving up the fight \u2014 for that's how it felt, it felt like giving up \u2014 meant giving up not only his life but also our story, our story of us as fighters, the story of us as invincible, and for the doctors, the story of themselves as healers.So what do we need?Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper. Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.People did mention hospice, but I wouldn't listen. Hospice was for people who were dying, and Terence wasn't dying. As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.We have a noble path to curing the disease, patients and doctors alike, but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying. Dying is seen as failing, and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye. Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets. So I'll give you a couple lines from him. This is a poem about Mark Antony. You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy? Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys. And he's been a pretty good general. He's won all the fights, he's eluded all the people that are out to get him, and yet this time, finally, he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost. The people are leaving. They're playing instruments. They're singing. And suddenly he knows he's been defeated. And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods, and it's time to let go. And the poet tells him what to do. He tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero.\"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing.\"That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.And isn't that what we're missing? How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes? The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system \u2014 doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope. Hope isn't a bug.

He said what surgeons always say:\n\n00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.377\n\"We got it all.\"\n\n00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:12.420\nThen there was a setback when the pathologists\n\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.793\nlooked at the kidney cancer closely.\n\n00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.422\nIt turned out to be a rare,\n\n00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:18.231\nexceedingly aggressive type,\n\n00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.313\nwith a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal\n\n00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:23.704\nin several weeks at most.\n\n00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:27.414\nAnd yet, he did not die.\n\n00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:30.924\nMysteriously, he lived on.\n\n00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:33.008\nHe coached Little League for our son.\n\n00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.560\nHe built a playhouse for our daughter.\n\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.634\nAnd meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet\n\n00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.308\nlooking for specialists.\n\n00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:42.869\nI'm looking for a cure.\n\n00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.946\nSo a year goes by\n\n00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:48.152\nbefore the cancer, as cancers do,\n\n00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.152\nreappears,\n\n00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:52.228\nand with it comes another death sentence,\n\n00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:54.421\nthis time nine months.\n\n00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:58.435\nSo we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.\n\n00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:00.255\nIt makes him so sick, he has to quit it,\n\n00:04:00.255 --> 00:04:03.272\nyet still he lives on.\n\n00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:05.168\nThen another year goes by.\n\n00:04:05.168 --> 00:04:06.718\nTwo years go by.\n\n00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:08.207\nMore specialists.\n\n00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.127\nWe take the kids to Italy.\n\n00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.596\nWe take the kids to Australia.\n\n00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:15.308\nAnd then more years pass,\n\n00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:17.698\nand the cancer begins to grow.\n\n00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:20.233\nThis time, there's new treatments on the horizon.\n\n00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.169\nThey're exotic. They're experimental.\n\n00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.377\nThey're going to attack the cancer in new ways.\n\n00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:29.703\nSo he enters a clinical trial, and it works.\n\n00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.632\nThe cancer begins to shrink,\n\n00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:33.909\nand for the third time,\n\n00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.268\nwe've dodged death.\n\n00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:40.565\nSo now I ask you,\n\n00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:42.954\nhow do I feel\n\n00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:45.468\nwhen the time finally comes\n\n00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:47.974\nand there's another dark night,\n\n00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:50.475\nsometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?\n\n00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:53.449\nThis time it's on the intensive care ward\n\n00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.287\nwhen a twentysomething resident\n\n00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:57.490\nthat I've never met before\n\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.083\ntells me that Terence is dying,\n\n00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.282\nperhaps tonight.\n\n00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:05.075\nSo what do I say when he says,\n\n00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:07.889\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.901\nThere's another drug out there.\n\n00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:11.589\nIt's newer. It's more powerful.\n\n00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.158\nHe started it just two weeks ago.\n\n00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:17.267\nPerhaps there's still hope ahead.\n\n00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.222\nSo what do I say?\n\n00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:22.578\nI say, \"Keep him alive if you can.\"\n\n00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:26.093\nAnd Terence died six days later.\n\n00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:30.141\nSo we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.\n\n00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:31.937\nIt was an exhilarating fight,\n\n00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:33.654\nand I'd repeat the fight today\n\n00:05:33.654 --> 00:05:36.303\nwithout a moment's hesitation.\n\n00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.254\nWe fought together, we lived together.\n\n00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:41.358\nIt turned what could have been\n\n00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:44.092\nseven of the grimmest years of our life\n\n00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:47.703\ninto seven of the most glorious.\n\n00:05:47.703 --> 00:05:50.478\nIt was also an expensive fight.\n\n00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:52.439\nIt was the kind of fight and the kind of choices\n\n00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.073\nthat everyone here agrees\n\n00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:56.478\npump up the cost of end-of-life care,\n\n00:05:56.478 --> 00:05:58.764\nand of healthcare for all of us.\n\n00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:01.846\nAnd for me, for us,\n\n00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:03.928\nwe pushed the fight right over the edge,\n\n00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:07.153\nand I never got the chance to say to him\n\n00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:10.573\nwhat I say to him now almost every day:\n\n00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:13.650\n\"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride.\"\n\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.138\nWe never got the chance to say goodbye.\n\n00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:18.417\nWe never thought it was the end.\n\n00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:23.596\nWe always had hope.\n\n00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:27.460\nSo what do we make of all of this?\n\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.038\nBeing a journalist, after Terence died,\n\n00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:34.327\nI wrote a book, \"The Cost Of Hope.\"\n\n00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.477\nI wrote it because I wanted to know\n\n00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:38.163\nwhy I did what I did,\n\n00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:39.964\nwhy he did what he did,\n\n00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:42.519\nwhy everyone around us did what they did.\n\n00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.155\nAnd what did I discover?\n\n00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.729\nWell, one of the things I discovered is that\n\n00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.806\nexperts think that one answer to\n\n00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:51.556\nwhat I did at the end was a piece of paper,\n\n00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.714\nthe advance directive,\n\n00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:58.054\nto help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.\n\n00:06:58.054 --> 00:07:02.168\nYet I had that piece of paper.\n\n00:07:02.168 --> 00:07:04.221\nWe both did.\n\n00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:05.911\nAnd they were readily available.\n\n00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:07.850\nI had them right at hand.\n\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.209\nBoth of them said the same thing:\n\n00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:14.710\nDo nothing if there is no further hope.\n\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.930\nI knew Terence's wishes\n\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.744\nas clearly and as surely as I knew my own.\n\n00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:25.948\nYet we never got to no further hope.\n\n00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:28.705\nEven with that clear-cut paper in our hands,\n\n00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:31.961\nwe just kept redefining hope.\n\n00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:37.253\nI believed I could keep him from dying,\n\n00:07:37.253 --> 00:07:40.067\nand I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen\n\n00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.278\nso many people and have talked to so many people\n\n00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:44.952\nwho have felt exactly the same way.\n\n00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:48.886\nRight up until days before his death,\n\n00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.212\nI felt strongly\n\n00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:56.255\nand powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,\n\n00:07:56.255 --> 00:08:01.502\nthat I could keep him from dying ever.\n\n00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:04.737\nNow, what do the experts call this?\n\n00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:07.084\nThey say it's denial.\n\n00:08:07.084 --> 00:08:09.275\nIt's a strong word, isn't it?\n\n00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:11.672\nYet I will tell you that denial\n\n00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:16.786\nisn't even close to a strong enough word\n\n00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:19.432\nto describe what those of us\n\n00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:23.070\nfacing the death of our loved ones go through.\n\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.411\nAnd I hear the medical professionals say,\n\n00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:27.494\n\"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,\n\n00:08:27.494 --> 00:08:29.945\nbut the family's in denial.\n\n00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:32.121\nThe family won't listen to reason.\n\n00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:34.143\nThey're in denial.\n\n00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:36.495\nHow can they insist on this treatment at the end?\n\n00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:39.799\nIt's so clear, yet they're in denial.\"\n\n00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.806\nNow, I think this maybe isn't\n\n00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:44.810\na very useful way of thinking.\n\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.088\nIt's not just families either.\n\n00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:49.213\nThe medical professionals too,\n\n00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:52.573\nyou out there, you're in denial too.\n\n00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:55.426\nYou want to help. You want to fix.\n\n00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.252\nYou want to do.\n\n00:08:57.252 --> 00:09:00.060\nYou've succeeded in everything you've done,\n\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.102\nand having a patient die,\n\n00:09:02.102 --> 00:09:05.681\nwell, that must feel like failure.\n\n00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:07.525\nI saw it firsthand.\n\n00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:10.227\nJust days before Terence died,\n\n00:09:10.227 --> 00:09:12.245\nhis oncologist said,\n\n00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:15.493\n\"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.\"\n\n00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:17.875\nDays before he died.\n\n00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.308\nYet Ira Byock,\n\n00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:21.656\nthe director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth\n\n00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:24.587\nsaid, \"You know, the best doctor in the world\n\n00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:29.195\nhas never succeeded in making anyone immortal.\"\n\n00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:35.701\nSo what the experts call \"denial,\" I call \"hope,\"\n\n00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.035\nand I'd like to borrow a phrase\n\n00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:41.256\nfrom my friends in software design.\n\n00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:44.818\nYou just redefine denial and hope,\n\n00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:48.046\nand it becomes a feature of being human.\n\n00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.907\nIt's not a bug.\n\n00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:52.233\nIt's a feature.\n\n00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:55.327\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:59.021\nSo we need to think more constructively\n\n00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:03.333\nabout this very common, very profound\n\n00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:07.289\nand very powerful human emotion.\n\n00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.913\nIt's part of the human condition,\n\n00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:12.090\nand yet our system and our thinking\n\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.259\nisn't built to accommodate it.\n\n00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:18.314\nSo Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,\n\n00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:20.219\nand I believed it.\n\n00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.333\nMaybe I wanted to believe it.\n\n00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:28.662\nAnd during Terence's illness, I, we,\n\n00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.384\nwe wanted to believe the story\n\n00:10:30.384 --> 00:10:32.979\nof our fight together too.\n\n00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:36.715\nGiving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,\n\n00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:38.654\nit felt like giving up --\n\n00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:41.371\nmeant giving up not only his life\n\n00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:45.078\nbut also our story,\n\n00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.288\nour story of us as fighters,\n\n00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:50.218\nthe story of us as invincible,\n\n00:10:50.218 --> 00:10:52.426\nand for the doctors, the story of themselves\n\n00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:54.984\nas healers.\n\n00:10:54.984 --> 00:10:57.668\nSo what do we need?\n\n00:10:57.668 --> 00:11:00.607\nMaybe we don't need a new piece of paper.\n\n00:11:00.607 --> 00:11:03.554\nMaybe we need a new story,\n\n00:11:03.554 --> 00:11:07.563\nnot a story about giving up the fight\n\n00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:09.834\nor of hopelessness,\n\n00:11:09.834 --> 00:11:13.245\nbut rather a story of victory and triumph,\n\n00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:18.088\nof a valiant battle and, eventually,\n\n00:11:18.088 --> 00:11:20.408\na graceful retreat,\n\n00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:23.415\na story that acknowledges\n\n00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:27.178\nthat not even the greatest general defeats every foe,\n\n00:11:27.178 --> 00:11:29.799\nthat no doctor has ever succeeded\n\n00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:32.189\nin making anyone immortal,\n\n00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:38.255\nand that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,\n\n00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:42.940\nhas ever stopped even the bravest,\n\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.989\nwittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband\n\n00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:51.182\nfrom dying when it was his time to go.\n\n00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:53.495\nPeople did mention hospice,\n\n00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:56.866\nbut I wouldn't listen.\n\n00:11:56.866 --> 00:12:00.791\nHospice was for people who were dying,\n\n00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.564\nand Terence wasn't dying.\n\n00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:06.474\nAs a result, he spent just four days in hospice,\n\n00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:08.291\nwhich I'm sure, as you all know,\n\n00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.381\nis a pretty typical outcome,\n\n00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:11.893\nand we never said goodbye\n\n00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:14.948\nbecause we were unprepared for the end.\n\n00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:18.695\nWe have a noble path to curing the disease,\n\n00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:21.025\npatients and doctors alike,\n\n00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:23.148\nbut there doesn't seem to be\n\n00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:25.748\na noble path to dying.\n\n00:12:25.748 --> 00:12:28.806\nDying is seen as failing,\n\n00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:31.458\nand we had a heroic narrative\n\n00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:33.551\nfor fighting together,\n\n00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:38.581\nbut we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.\n\n00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:42.699\nSo maybe we need a narrative\n\n00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:46.175\nfor acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,\n\n00:12:46.175 --> 00:12:48.737\nand maybe our new story will be\n\n00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:53.343\nabout a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.\n\n00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:55.810\nTerence loved poetry,\n\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.037\nand the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy\n\n00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:01.466\nis one of my favorite poets.\n\n00:13:01.466 --> 00:13:04.350\nSo I'll give you a couple lines from him.\n\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.566\nThis is a poem about Mark Antony.\n\n00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:09.259\nYou know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,\n\n00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:11.124\nCleopatra's guy?\n\n00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.661\nActually, one of Cleopatra's guys.\n\n00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:16.086\nAnd he's been a pretty good general.\n\n00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.146\nHe's won all the fights,\n\n00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:19.601\nhe's eluded all the people that are out to get him,\n\n00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.389\nand yet this time, finally,\n\n00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.138\nhe's come to the city of Alexandria\n\n00:13:23.138 --> 00:13:24.820\nand realized he's lost.\n\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.536\nThe people are leaving. They're playing instruments.\n\n00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:27.859\nThey're singing.\n\n00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:30.459\nAnd suddenly he knows he's been defeated.\n\n00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.638\nAnd he suddenly knows\n\n00:13:32.638 --> 00:13:35.163\nhe's been deserted by the gods,\n\n00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.103\nand it's time to let go.\n\n00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:39.070\nAnd the poet tells him what to do.\n\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.336\nHe tells him how to say a noble goodbye,\n\n00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:46.183\na goodbye that's fit for a hero.\n\n00:13:46.183 --> 00:13:48.932\n\"As if long-prepared,\n\n00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.611\nas if courageous,\n\n00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:54.208\nas it becomes you\n\n00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.380\nwho were worthy of such a city,\n\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.783\napproach the window with a firm step,\n\n00:13:58.783 --> 00:14:01.318\nand with emotion,\n\n00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:03.517\nbut not with the entreaties\n\n00:14:03.517 --> 00:14:06.278\nor the complaints of a coward,\n\n00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.249\nas a last enjoyment,\n\n00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:10.373\nlisten to the sounds,\n\n00:14:10.373 --> 00:14:13.707\nthe exquisite instruments of the musical troops,\n\n00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.988\nand bid her farewell,\n\n00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:20.403\nthe Alexandria you are losing.\"\n\n00:14:20.403 --> 00:14:24.093\nThat's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,\n\n00:14:24.093 --> 00:14:26.111\na goodbye for a man\n\n00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.085\nfor whom anything,\n\n00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:31.193\nwell, almost anything,\n\n00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:33.083\nwas possible,\n\n00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:36.223\na goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.\n\n00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:38.416\nAnd isn't that what we're missing?\n\n00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:40.475\nHow can we learn that people's decisions\n\n00:14:40.475 --> 00:14:41.985\nabout their loved ones\n\n00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:45.914\nare often based strongly, powerfully,\n\n00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:48.766\nmany times irrationally,\n\n00:14:48.766 --> 00:14:51.110\non the slimmest of hopes?\n\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.132\nThe overwhelming presence of hope\n\n00:14:54.132 --> 00:14:55.555\nisn't denial.\n\n00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:58.375\nIt's part of our DNA as humans,\n\n00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.693\nand maybe it's time our healthcare system --\n\n00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:05.177\ndoctors, patients, insurance companies, us,\n\n00:15:05.177 --> 00:15:09.151\nstarted accounting for the power of that hope.\n\n00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:11.451\nHope isn't a bug.\n\n00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:13.820\nIt's a feature.\n\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.315\nThank you.\n\n00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:19.370\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Ingenious homes in unexpected places", "duration": "1018", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/iwan_baan_ingenious_homes_in_unexpected_places", "transcript": "Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects, documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit. I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum, or like right here in New York with the High Line, a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this.But what I find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people, like here in Chandigarh, India, the city which has been completely designed by the architect Le Corbusier. Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for, like here, where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall. But over the course of several years, I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron. At these large-scale construction sites in China, you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process. As the length of the construction takes years, workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building.Over the past seven years, I've been following my fascination with the built environment, and for those of you who know me, you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase 365 days a year. Being constantly on the move means that sometimes I am able to catch life's most unpredictable moments, like here in New York the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.Just over three years ago, I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela, and while flying over the city, I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city, a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums, draped literally all over the mountains. During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank, I learned about the Torre David, a 45-story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. The building was under construction until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early '90s. About eight years ago, people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower. There's only one little entrance to the entire building, and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door. Together, the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower. In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees. They also made a basketball court. But when you look up closely, you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through.Within the tower, people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower. With no elevators, the tower is like a 45-story walkup. Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. And with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by, this tower becomes like a living city, a place which is alive with micro-economies and small businesses. The inventive inhabitants, for instance, find opportunities in the most unexpected cases, like the adjacent parking garage, which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments.A walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create walls, how to make an air flow, how to create transparency, circulation throughout the tower, essentially creating a home that's completely adapted to the conditions of the site. When a new inhabitant moves into the tower, they already have a roof over their head, so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets. Slowly, from found materials, walls rise, and people create a space out of any found objects or materials.It's remarkable to see the design decisions that they're making, like when everything is made out of red bricks, some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish.The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands, and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower. They typically make the best out of their conditions, and try to make their spaces look nice and homey, or at least up until as far as they can reach. Throughout the tower, you come across all kinds of services, like the barber, small factories, and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. And you even find a church. And on the 30th floor, there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed. From the outside, behind this always-changing facade, you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic, intuitive way that responds directly to their needs.Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria, to a community called Makoko, a slum where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place, when you see it from above, there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area. When out on the water, it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house, selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame, you'll see a small child peering back at you, and while Makoko seems to be packed with people, what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in Nigeria, and especially in these areas like Makoko, are painful reminders of how out of control things really are.In Makoko, very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area. This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water, so fishing and boat-making are common professions. You'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area, like barbershops, CD and DVD stores, movie theaters, tailors, everything is there. There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.On this particular evening, I came across this live band dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits. They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator for all of the community to enjoy.By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black, save for a small lightbulb or a fire.What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine, Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi, who recently finished building this three-story floating school for the kids in Makoko. With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.Another place I'd like to share with you is the Zabbaleen in Cairo. They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '40s, and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo. For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities, but in the early 1980s, they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city. Today, they live in this area, approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people, who live in this community of self-built multi-story houses where up to three generations live in one structure. While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid, each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. I find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there, like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him, or like these two young men who are sitting and chatting amongst these tons of garbage. While to most of us, living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable, to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just a different type of normal. In all these places I've talked about today, what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal, and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. Throughout the day, it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets, just like this engagement party. In this tradition, the bride-to-be displays all of their belongings, which they soon bring to their new husband. A gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories. Like Makoko and the Torre David, throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood. There are the retail shops, the cafes and the restaurants, and the community is this community of Coptic Christians, so you'll also find a church, along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area, and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops, the barbers, everything.Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. While from the outside, these homes look like any other informal structure in the city, when you step inside, you are met with all manner of design decisions and interior decoration. Despite having limited access to space and money, the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. Every apartment is unique, and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values. Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details. The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner, where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.But despite this elaborate decor, sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways, like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door. When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm, where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room. But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area.The attention to this detail astonished me, and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment, from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated. But if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach-churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment, it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill. What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions, I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love, care, and unreserved passion.Let's move across the map to China, to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu. In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil, there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground. These dwellings are called the yaodongs. Through this architecture by subtraction, these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil. In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape, and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square, rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground. When I asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground, they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn't have the money to buy materials, and this digging out was their most logical form of living.From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities have approached the tasks of planning, design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances. Created by these very people who live, work and play in these particular spaces, these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances. In most of these places, the government is completely absent, leaving inhabitants with no choice but to reappropriate found materials, and while these communities are highly disadvantaged, they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity, and prove that indeed we have the ability to adapt to all manner of circumstances. What makes places like the Torre David particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into. Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves, and how highly particular their solutions would be, if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into.Today, you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. From China to Brazil, these projects attempt to provide as many houses as possible, but they're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to the individual needs of the people.I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration, Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful Shorefast Foundation, based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland. She says that \"there's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy,\" and I couldn't agree with her more.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1846, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:15.318\nThroughout my career, I've been fortunate enough\n\n00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:16.677\nto work with many of the great\n\n00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:18.403\ninternational architects,\n\n00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.827\ndocumenting their work and observing\n\n00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:22.786\nhow their designs have the capacity\n\n00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:25.755\nto influence the cities in which they sit.\n\n00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.598\nI think of new cities like Dubai\n\n00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:31.075\nor ancient cities like Rome\n\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.437\nwith Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,\n\n00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:37.254\nor like right here in New York with the High Line,\n\n00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:39.825\na city which has been so much influenced\n\n00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:41.528\nby the development of this.\n\n00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:43.603\nBut what I find really fascinating\n\n00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:46.699\nis what happens when architects and planners leave\n\n00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.818\nand these places become appropriated by people,\n\n00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:52.158\nlike here in Chandigarh, India,\n\n00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:54.478\nthe city which has been completely designed\n\n00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:56.617\nby the architect Le Corbusier.\n\n00:00:56.617 --> 00:00:59.597\nNow 60 years later, the city has been taken over\n\n00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:01.218\nby people in very different ways\n\n00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:04.540\nfrom whatever perhaps intended for,\n\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.846\nlike here, where you have the people\n\n00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:09.809\nsitting in the windows of the assembly hall.\n\n00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.896\nBut over the course of several years,\n\n00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:14.314\nI've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's\n\n00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:16.360\nCCTV building in Beijing\n\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.198\nand the olympic stadium in the same city\n\n00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:22.342\nby the architects Herzog and de Meuron.\n\n00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:25.787\nAt these large-scale construction sites in China,\n\n00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:27.910\nyou see a sort of makeshift camp\n\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.100\nwhere workers live during the entire building process.\n\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.582\nAs the length of the construction takes years,\n\n00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:37.340\nworkers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready\n\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.606\ninformal city, making for quite a juxtaposition\n\n00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:44.049\nagainst the sophisticated structures that they're building.\n\n00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.258\nOver the past seven years, I've been following\n\n00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:48.929\nmy fascination with the built environment,\n\n00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.632\nand for those of you who know me, you would say\n\n00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:53.618\nthat this obsession has led me to live\n\n00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:57.040\nout of a suitcase 365 days a year.\n\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.537\nBeing constantly on the move\n\n00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:01.352\nmeans that sometimes I am able\n\n00:02:01.352 --> 00:02:04.528\nto catch life's most unpredictable moments,\n\n00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:06.509\nlike here in New York\n\n00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.902\nthe day after the Sandy storm hit the city.\n\n00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:12.966\nJust over three years ago,\n\n00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.652\nI was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,\n\n00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.448\nand while flying over the city, I was just amazed\n\n00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:20.488\nby the extent to which the slums\n\n00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:22.937\nreach into every corner of the city,\n\n00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:25.674\na place where nearly 70 percent of the population\n\n00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.015\nlives in slums,\n\n00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:30.308\ndraped literally all over the mountains.\n\n00:02:30.308 --> 00:02:33.735\nDuring a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,\n\n00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:36.088\nI learned about the Torre David,\n\n00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:38.631\na 45-story office building which sits\n\n00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.684\nright in the center of Caracas.\n\n00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:42.287\nThe building was under construction\n\n00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.813\nuntil the collapse of the Venezuelan economy\n\n00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:48.179\nand the death of the developer in the early '90s.\n\n00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.141\nAbout eight years ago, people started moving\n\n00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.154\ninto the abandoned tower\n\n00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.173\nand began to build their homes right in between\n\n00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:58.372\nevery column of this unfinished tower.\n\n00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:01.169\nThere's only one little entrance to the entire building,\n\n00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.107\nand the 3,000 residents come in and out\n\n00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:06.175\nthrough that single door.\n\n00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:09.064\nTogether, the inhabitants created public spaces\n\n00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.337\nand designed them to feel more like a home\n\n00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:13.932\nand less like an unfinished tower.\n\n00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:17.447\nIn the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.\n\n00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.457\nThey also made a basketball court.\n\n00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:22.157\nBut when you look up closely,\n\n00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:24.638\nyou see massive holes where elevators\n\n00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.218\nand services would have run through.\n\n00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.207\nWithin the tower, people have come up\n\n00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:31.473\nwith all sorts of solutions\n\n00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:33.454\nin response to the various needs\n\n00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:36.941\nwhich arise from living in an unfinished tower.\n\n00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:38.140\nWith no elevators,\n\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.468\nthe tower is like a 45-story walkup.\n\n00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.718\nDesigned in very specific ways\n\n00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:45.194\nby this group of people\n\n00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:49.090\nwho haven't had any education in architecture or design.\n\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.371\nAnd with each inhabitant finding their own\n\n00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.338\nunique way of coming by,\n\n00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:56.140\nthis tower becomes like a living city,\n\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.352\na place which is alive with micro-economies\n\n00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:01.269\nand small businesses.\n\n00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.883\nThe inventive inhabitants, for instance,\n\n00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:06.614\nfind opportunities in the most unexpected cases,\n\n00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:08.739\nlike the adjacent parking garage,\n\n00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.816\nwhich has been reclaimed as a taxi route\n\n00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.114\nto shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps\n\n00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:14.561\nin order to shorten the hike\n\n00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.579\nup to the apartments.\n\n00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.489\nA walk through the tower\n\n00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.599\nreveals how residents have figured out\n\n00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.125\nhow to create walls, how to make an air flow,\n\n00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.088\nhow to create transparency,\n\n00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:30.512\ncirculation throughout the tower,\n\n00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:32.331\nessentially creating a home\n\n00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:33.979\nthat's completely adapted\n\n00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.257\nto the conditions of the site.\n\n00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:39.382\nWhen a new inhabitant moves into the tower,\n\n00:04:39.382 --> 00:04:41.290\nthey already have a roof over their head,\n\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.329\nso they just typically mark their space\n\n00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:46.245\nwith a few curtains or sheets.\n\n00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:49.417\nSlowly, from found materials, walls rise,\n\n00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:52.340\nand people create a space out of any found objects\n\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.229\nor materials.\n\n00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.729\nIt's remarkable to see the design decisions\n\n00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.405\nthat they're making,\n\n00:04:58.405 --> 00:05:01.040\nlike when everything is made out of red bricks,\n\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.305\nsome residents will cover that red brick\n\n00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:07.166\nwith another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper\n\n00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:12.218\njust to make it a kind of clean finish.\n\n00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:14.677\nThe inhabitants literally built up these homes\n\n00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:16.834\nwith their own hands, and this labor of love\n\n00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:18.587\ninstills a great sense of pride\n\n00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:21.839\nin many families living in this tower.\n\n00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.773\nThey typically make the best out of their conditions,\n\n00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:27.581\nand try to make their spaces look nice and homey,\n\n00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:31.128\nor at least up until as far as they can reach.\n\n00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:34.140\nThroughout the tower, you come across\n\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.306\nall kinds of services, like the barber,\n\n00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:40.119\nsmall factories, and every floor has\n\n00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:43.543\na little grocery store or shop.\n\n00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.053\nAnd you even find a church.\n\n00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:48.417\nAnd on the 30th floor, there is a gym\n\n00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:50.171\nwhere all the weights and barbells\n\n00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:51.967\nare made out of the leftover pulleys\n\n00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:55.377\nfrom the elevators which were never installed.\n\n00:05:55.377 --> 00:05:58.012\nFrom the outside, behind this always-changing facade,\n\n00:05:58.012 --> 00:05:59.631\nyou see how the fixed concrete beams\n\n00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.496\nprovide a framework for the inhabitants\n\n00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:02.963\nto create their homes\n\n00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.839\nin an organic, intuitive way\n\n00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.556\nthat responds directly to their needs.\n\n00:06:07.556 --> 00:06:10.211\nLet's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,\n\n00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:12.782\nto a community called Makoko,\n\n00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:15.341\na slum where 150,000 people\n\n00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.523\nlive just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:22.237\nWhile it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,\n\n00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:24.643\nwhen you see it from above, there seems to be\n\n00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:27.808\na whole grid of waterways and canals\n\n00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:30.322\nconnecting each and every home.\n\n00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:34.536\nFrom the main dock, people board long wooden canoes\n\n00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:37.206\nwhich carry them out to their various homes and shops\n\n00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:39.881\nlocated in the expansive area.\n\n00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:41.828\nWhen out on the water, it's clear\n\n00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:43.717\nthat life has been completely adapted\n\n00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:46.356\nto this very specific way of living.\n\n00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.003\nEven the canoes become variety stores\n\n00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:50.943\nwhere ladies paddle from house to house,\n\n00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:55.059\nselling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.\n\n00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:57.078\nBehind every window and door frame,\n\n00:06:57.078 --> 00:06:59.781\nyou'll see a small child peering back at you,\n\n00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.765\nand while Makoko seems to be packed with people,\n\n00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:04.600\nwhat's more shocking is actually\n\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.085\nthe amount of children pouring out of every building.\n\n00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:10.065\nThe population growth in Nigeria,\n\n00:07:10.065 --> 00:07:12.534\nand especially in these areas like Makoko,\n\n00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:14.686\nare painful reminders\n\n00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:18.925\nof how out of control things really are.\n\n00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:21.204\nIn Makoko, very few systems\n\n00:07:21.204 --> 00:07:23.070\nand infrastructures exist.\n\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.002\nElectricity is rigged and freshest water\n\n00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:29.367\ncomes from self-built wells throughout the area.\n\n00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:31.771\nThis entire economic model\n\n00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:34.563\nis designed to meet a specific way of living\n\n00:07:34.563 --> 00:07:37.678\non the water, so fishing and boat-making\n\n00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.453\nare common professions.\n\n00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:41.420\nYou'll have a set of entrepreneurs\n\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.444\nwho have set up businesses throughout the area,\n\n00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:49.244\nlike barbershops, CD and DVD stores,\n\n00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:54.607\nmovie theaters, tailors, everything is there.\n\n00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.402\nThere is even a photo studio\n\n00:07:56.402 --> 00:07:58.159\nwhere you see the sort of aspiration\n\n00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:01.459\nto live in a real house or to be associated\n\n00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:05.758\nwith a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.\n\n00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:07.382\nOn this particular evening,\n\n00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:09.486\nI came across this live band\n\n00:08:09.486 --> 00:08:12.637\ndressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.\n\n00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:14.667\nThey were floating through the canals\n\n00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:17.591\nin a large canoe with a fitted-out generator\n\n00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:21.927\nfor all of the community to enjoy.\n\n00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:24.918\nBy nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,\n\n00:08:24.918 --> 00:08:26.746\nsave for a small lightbulb\n\n00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:29.480\nor a fire.\n\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.095\nWhat originally brought me to Makoko\n\n00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.902\nwas this project from a friend of mine,\n\n00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:36.703\nKunl\u00e9 Adeyemi, who recently finished building\n\n00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:38.749\nthis three-story floating school\n\n00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:40.770\nfor the kids in Makoko.\n\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.799\nWith this entire village existing on the water,\n\n00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.222\npublic space is very limited,\n\n00:08:46.222 --> 00:08:47.886\nso now that the school is finished,\n\n00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:51.260\nthe ground floor is a playground for the kids,\n\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.127\nbut when classes are out, the platform\n\n00:08:53.127 --> 00:08:54.698\nis just like a town square,\n\n00:08:54.698 --> 00:08:57.093\nwhere the fishermen mend their nets\n\n00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:01.258\nand floating shopkeepers dock their boats.\n\n00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:03.788\nAnother place I'd like to share with you\n\n00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:05.836\nis the Zabbaleen in Cairo.\n\n00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:08.595\nThey're descendants of farmers who began migrating\n\n00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:11.065\nfrom the upper Egypt in the '40s,\n\n00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:12.491\nand today they make their living\n\n00:09:12.491 --> 00:09:15.681\nby collecting and recycling waste from homes\n\n00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:17.932\nfrom all over Cairo.\n\n00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.054\nFor years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages\n\n00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:22.723\nwhere they would move around\n\n00:09:22.723 --> 00:09:25.242\ntrying to avoid the local authorities,\n\n00:09:25.242 --> 00:09:27.561\nbut in the early 1980s, they settled\n\n00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:29.278\non the Mokattam rocks\n\n00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:31.927\njust at the eastern edge of the city.\n\n00:09:31.927 --> 00:09:33.958\nToday, they live in this area,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.762\napproximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,\n\n00:09:36.762 --> 00:09:38.895\nwho live in this community of self-built\n\n00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:41.075\nmulti-story houses\n\n00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:45.368\nwhere up to three generations live in one structure.\n\n00:09:45.368 --> 00:09:47.846\nWhile these apartments that they built for themselves\n\n00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:50.831\nappear to lack any planning or formal grid,\n\n00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:54.237\neach family specializing in a certain form of recycling\n\n00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:56.470\nmeans that the ground floor of each apartment\n\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.127\nis reserved for garbage-related activities\n\n00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:04.150\nand the upper floor is dedicated to living space.\n\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.021\nI find it incredible to see\n\n00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:07.957\nhow these piles and piles of garbage\n\n00:10:07.957 --> 00:10:10.468\nare invisible to the people who live there,\n\n00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:13.868\nlike this very distinguished man who is posing\n\n00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:18.077\nwhile all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,\n\n00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:20.717\nor like these two young men who are sitting\n\n00:10:20.717 --> 00:10:25.569\nand chatting amongst these tons of garbage.\n\n00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:27.302\nWhile to most of us, living amongst\n\n00:10:27.302 --> 00:10:29.390\nthese piles and piles of garbage\n\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.741\nmay seem totally uninhabitable,\n\n00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:33.831\nto those in the Zabbaleen, this is just\n\n00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:36.310\na different type of normal.\n\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.947\nIn all these places I've talked about today,\n\n00:10:38.947 --> 00:10:41.068\nwhat I do find fascinating is that there's really\n\n00:10:41.068 --> 00:10:42.666\nno such thing as normal,\n\n00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:44.871\nand it proves that people are able to adapt\n\n00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:47.246\nto any kind of situation.\n\n00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.762\nThroughout the day, it's quite common\n\n00:10:48.762 --> 00:10:52.110\nto come across a small party taking place\n\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.954\nin the streets, just like this engagement party.\n\n00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:57.941\nIn this tradition, the bride-to-be\n\n00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:00.086\ndisplays all of their belongings,\n\n00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.280\nwhich they soon bring to their new husband.\n\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.311\nA gathering like this one\n\n00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:06.208\noffers such a juxtaposition\n\n00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.986\nwhere all the new stuff is displayed\n\n00:11:08.986 --> 00:11:11.352\nand all the garbage is used\n\n00:11:11.352 --> 00:11:17.989\nas props to display all their new home accessories.\n\n00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:20.155\nLike Makoko and the Torre David,\n\n00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:21.700\nthroughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all\n\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.844\nthe same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.\n\n00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:26.924\nThere are the retail shops, the cafes\n\n00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:29.244\nand the restaurants, and the community\n\n00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:32.185\nis this community of Coptic Christians,\n\n00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:34.424\nso you'll also find a church,\n\n00:11:34.424 --> 00:11:37.869\nalong with the scores of religious iconographies\n\n00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:39.627\nthroughout the area,\n\n00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:42.816\nand also all the everyday services\n\n00:11:42.816 --> 00:11:44.615\nlike the electronic repair shops,\n\n00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:47.703\nthe barbers, everything.\n\n00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:49.876\nVisiting the homes of the Zabbaleen\n\n00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.565\nis also full of surprises.\n\n00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:53.077\nWhile from the outside,\n\n00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:55.620\nthese homes look like any other informal structure\n\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.938\nin the city, when you step inside,\n\n00:11:57.938 --> 00:12:01.801\nyou are met with all manner of design decisions\n\n00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:04.068\nand interior decoration.\n\n00:12:04.068 --> 00:12:07.232\nDespite having limited access to space and money,\n\n00:12:07.232 --> 00:12:09.111\nthe homes in the area are designed\n\n00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:11.097\nwith care and detail.\n\n00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.140\nEvery apartment is unique,\n\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.933\nand this individuality tells a story\n\n00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:18.059\nabout each family's circumstances and values.\n\n00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:20.205\nMany of these people take their homes\n\n00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:23.373\nand interior spaces very seriously,\n\n00:12:23.373 --> 00:12:24.880\nputting a lot of work and care\n\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.206\ninto the details.\n\n00:12:26.206 --> 00:12:29.379\nThe shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,\n\n00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:33.236\nwhere walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.\n\n00:12:33.236 --> 00:12:36.219\nBut despite this elaborate decor,\n\n00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:38.773\nsometimes these apartments are used\n\n00:12:38.773 --> 00:12:40.583\nin very unexpected ways,\n\n00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:42.963\nlike this home which caught my attention\n\n00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:46.445\nwhile all the mud and the grass was literally\n\n00:12:46.445 --> 00:12:48.932\nseeping out under the front door.\n\n00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.731\nWhen I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment\n\n00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.039\nwas being transformed into a complete animal farm,\n\n00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:58.930\nwhere six or seven cows stood grazing\n\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.602\nin what otherwise would be the living room.\n\n00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:06.970\nBut then in the apartment across the hall\n\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.493\nfrom this cow shed lives a newly married couple\n\n00:13:09.493 --> 00:13:11.319\nin what locals describe\n\n00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:19.440\nas one of the nicest apartments in the area.\n\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.666\nThe attention to this detail astonished me,\n\n00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:25.337\nand as the owner of the home so proudly\n\n00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:27.323\nled me around this apartment,\n\n00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:31.039\nfrom floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.\n\n00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:34.841\nBut if it weren't for the strangely familiar\n\n00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:37.704\nstomach-churning odor that constantly\n\n00:13:37.704 --> 00:13:41.149\npasses through the apartment,\n\n00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:43.742\nit would be easy to forget\n\n00:13:43.742 --> 00:13:46.434\nthat you are standing next to a cow shed\n\n00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:51.931\nand on top of a landfill.\n\n00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:54.610\nWhat moved me the most was that despite\n\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.644\nthese seemingly inhospitable conditions,\n\n00:13:56.644 --> 00:13:58.437\nI was welcomed with open arms\n\n00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:02.363\ninto a home that was made with love, care,\n\n00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:04.613\nand unreserved passion.\n\n00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:07.997\nLet's move across the map to China,\n\n00:14:07.997 --> 00:14:11.884\nto an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.\n\n00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:15.574\nIn a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,\n\n00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:18.257\nthere lived until recently an estimated\n\n00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:22.126\n40 million people in these houses underground.\n\n00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:24.577\nThese dwellings are called the yaodongs.\n\n00:14:24.577 --> 00:14:26.767\nThrough this architecture by subtraction,\n\n00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:30.354\nthese yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.\n\n00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:34.228\nIn these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,\n\n00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:36.974\nand hidden behind these mounds of dirt\n\n00:14:36.974 --> 00:14:39.474\nare these square, rectangular houses\n\n00:14:39.474 --> 00:14:42.065\nwhich sit seven meters below the ground.\n\n00:14:42.065 --> 00:14:44.053\nWhen I asked people why they were digging\n\n00:14:44.053 --> 00:14:45.942\ntheir houses from the ground,\n\n00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:47.965\nthey simply replied that they are poor wheat\n\n00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:50.145\nand apple farmers who didn't have the money\n\n00:14:50.145 --> 00:14:53.546\nto buy materials, and this digging out\n\n00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:58.014\nwas their most logical form of living.\n\n00:14:58.014 --> 00:15:00.912\nFrom Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities\n\n00:15:00.912 --> 00:15:02.911\nhave approached the tasks of planning,\n\n00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:05.310\ndesign and management of their communities\n\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.689\nand neighborhoods in ways that respond\n\n00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:11.599\nspecifically to their environment and circumstances.\n\n00:15:11.599 --> 00:15:13.830\nCreated by these very people who live,\n\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.541\nwork and play in these particular spaces,\n\n00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.538\nthese neighborhoods are intuitively designed\n\n00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:23.576\nto make the most of their circumstances.\n\n00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:25.481\nIn most of these places, the government\n\n00:15:25.481 --> 00:15:28.010\nis completely absent, leaving inhabitants\n\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.929\nwith no choice but to reappropriate found materials,\n\n00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:34.901\nand while these communities are highly disadvantaged,\n\n00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:36.943\nthey do present examples\n\n00:15:36.943 --> 00:15:39.391\nof brilliant forms of ingenuity,\n\n00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:41.719\nand prove that indeed we have the ability\n\n00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:45.262\nto adapt to all manner of circumstances.\n\n00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:47.455\nWhat makes places like the Torre David\n\n00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:49.252\nparticularly remarkable\n\n00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:51.153\nis this sort of skeleton framework\n\n00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:52.775\nwhere people can have a foundation\n\n00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:54.847\nwhere they can tap into.\n\n00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:57.945\nNow imagine what these already ingenious communities\n\n00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:00.037\ncould create themselves,\n\n00:16:00.037 --> 00:16:02.723\nand how highly particular their solutions would be,\n\n00:16:02.723 --> 00:16:05.265\nif they were given the basic infrastructures\n\n00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:07.244\nthat they could tap into.\n\n00:16:07.244 --> 00:16:10.751\nToday, you see these large residential development projects\n\n00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:13.206\nwhich offer cookie-cutter housing solutions\n\n00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:15.248\nto massive amounts of people.\n\n00:16:15.248 --> 00:16:17.808\nFrom China to Brazil, these projects attempt\n\n00:16:17.808 --> 00:16:20.815\nto provide as many houses as possible,\n\n00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:23.018\nbut they're completely generic\n\n00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:24.923\nand simply do not work as an answer\n\n00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:28.252\nto the individual needs of the people.\n\n00:16:28.252 --> 00:16:30.706\nI would like to end with a quote\n\n00:16:30.706 --> 00:16:33.787\nfrom a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,\n\n00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:36.553\nZita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful\n\n00:16:36.553 --> 00:16:38.229\nShorefast Foundation,\n\n00:16:38.229 -->

joy,\"\n\n00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:48.377\nand I couldn't agree with her more.\n\n00:16:48.377 --> 00:16:49.820\nThank you.\n\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.782\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What will a future

privacy incident involving Adam and Eve, and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years.You know the incident. Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked. They freak out. And the rest is history.Nowadays, Adam and Eve would probably act differently.[@Adam Last nite was a blast! loved dat apple LOL][@Eve yep.. babe, know what happened to my pants tho?]We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before, and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information, or big data, but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy. And my story is about these tradeoffs.We start with an observation which, in my mind, has become clearer and clearer in the past few years, that any personal information can become sensitive information. Back in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos were shot worldwide, but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month, 2.5 billion photos were uploaded, most of them identified. In the same span of time, computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together: increasing availability of facial data; improving facial recognizing ability by computers; but also cloud computing, which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three-letter agencies; and ubiquitous computing, which allows my phone, which is not a supercomputer, to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds? Well, we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity.To test that, we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus. We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study, and we took a shot with a webcam, and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. While they were filling out the survey, we uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster, and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles. By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey, the page had been dynamically updated with the 10 best matching photos which the recognizer had found, and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo.Do you see the subject? Well, the computer did, and in fact did so for one out of three subjects.So essentially, we can start from an anonymous face, offline or online, and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. But a few years back, we did something else. We started from social media data, we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security, and we ended up predicting social security numbers, which in the United States are extremely sensitive information.Do you see where I'm going with this? So if you combine the two studies together, then the question becomes, can you start from a face and, using facial recognition, find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person, and from that publicly available information infer non-publicly available information, much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face? And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did. Of course, the accuracy keeps getting worse. [27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)] But in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time: looking for a match, finding public information, trying to infer sensitive information, and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject, an example of augmented reality, probably a creepy example of augmented reality. In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available, just as a proof of concept.In fact, take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme. Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or, one day, their contact lenses, and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. What will this future without secrets look like? And should we care?We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases, but in fact, having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. In another experiment, we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate. We included in this information some references to some funny, absolutely legal, but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online. Now interestingly, among our subjects, some had posted comparable information, and some had not. Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject? Paradoxically, it was the group who had posted similar information, an example of moral dissonance.Now you may be thinking, this does not apply to me, because I have nothing to hide. But in fact, privacy is not about having something negative to hide. Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization, and you receive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and you decide to find more information about the candidates. Therefore, you Google their names and in a certain universe, you find this information. Or in a parallel universe, you find this information. Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview? If you think so, then you are not like the U.S. employers who are, in fact, part of our experiment, meaning we did exactly that. We created Facebook profiles, manipulating traits, then we started sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies in the U.S., and we detected, we monitored, whether they were searching for our candidates, and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media. And they were. Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates.Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor. But think again. Why should that be always the case? In a movie which came out a few years ago, \"Minority Report,\" a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. Now, that movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now, and as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you, and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect.So as an example, this is another experiment actually we are running, not yet completed. Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends, and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create, in real time, a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites, but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product, and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends, and you will not even know that this is happening.Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight. One of these mechanisms is transparency, telling people what you are going to do with their data. And in principle, that's a very good thing. It's necessary, but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do, and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information.So in yet another experiment, this one with students, we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior, including pretty sensitive questions, such as this one. [Have you ever cheated in an exam?] Now to one group of subjects, we told them, \"Only other students will see your answers.\" To another group of subjects, we told them, \"Students and faculty will see your answers.\" Transparency. Notification. And sure enough, this worked, in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second. It makes sense, right? But then we added the misdirection. We repeated the experiment with the same two groups, this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions.How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers? Ten minutes? Five minutes? One minute? How about 15 seconds? Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information, as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers.Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy, but that is not my point. In fact, I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives. The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done, and certainly not the best way they can be done. When someone tells you, \"People don't care about privacy,\" consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy, and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data, consider that in the last 20 years, researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner. We can browse the Internet anonymously. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient, not even the NSA. We can have even privacy-preserving data mining. In other words, we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy. Of course, these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects, which is why, perhaps, you don't hear more about them.Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden. There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn't have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed. You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost.\" In the garden, Adam and Eve are materially content. They're happy. They are satisfied. However, they also lack knowledge and self-awareness. The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge, that's when they discover themselves. They become aware. They achieve autonomy. The price to pay, however, is leaving the garden. So privacy, in a way, is both the means and the price to pay for freedom.Again, marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them, but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. We get free content. We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps. But in fact, in a few years, organizations will know so much about us, they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them, and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them.Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort. Even more so than George Orwell, the author is, of course, Aldous Huxley. In \"Brave New World,\" he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. However, in the book, he also offers us a way out of that society, similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden. In the words of the Savage, regaining autonomy and freedom is possible, although the price to pay is steep. So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information, the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom, rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us.Right now, many of us do not even know that the fight is going on, but it is, whether you like it or not. And at the risk of playing the serpent, I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here, the awareness of what is going on, and in your hands, just a few clicks away.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

00:01:21.460\nhas become clearer and clearer in the past few years,\n\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.557\nthat any personal information\n\n00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:25.842\ncan become sensitive information.\n\n00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:29.967\nBack in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos\n\n00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.879\nwere shot worldwide,\n\n00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.944\nbut only a minuscule proportion of them\n\n00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:36.827\nwere actually uploaded online.\n\n00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:40.188\nIn 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month,\n\n00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:43.458\n2.5 billion photos were uploaded,\n\n00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.340\nmost of them identified.\n\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.220\nIn the same span of time,\n\n00:01:47.220 -->

kind of computational power\n\n00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:12.903\nwhich a few years ago was only the domain\n\n00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.685\nof three-letter agencies;\n\n00:02:14.685 -->

that the result\n\n00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:30.291\nof this combination of technologies\n\n00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.179\nwill be a radical change in our very notions\n\n00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.436\nof privacy and anonymity.\n\n00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:37.429\nTo test that, we did an experiment\n\n00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.550\non Carnegie Mellon University campus.\n\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.649\nWe asked students who were walking by\n\n00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.428\nto participate in a study,\n\n00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.990\nand we took a shot with a webcam,\n\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.772\nand we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop.\n\n00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.751\nWhile they were filling out the survey,\n\n00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.548\nwe uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster,\n\n00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.275\nand we started using a facial recognizer\n\n00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.680\nto match that shot to a database\n\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.073\nof some hundreds of thousands of images\n\n00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:03.669\nwhich we had downloaded from Facebook profiles.\n\n00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.928\nBy the time the subject reached the last page\n\n00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:10.275\non the survey, the page had been dynamically updated\n\n00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:12.588\nwith the 10 best matching photos\n\n00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:14.873\nwhich the recognizer had found,\n\n00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:16.611\nand we asked the subjects to indicate\n\n00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:20.731\nwhether he or she found themselves in the photo.\n\n00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:24.430\nDo you see the subject?\n\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.275\nWell, the computer did, and in fact did so\n\n00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:29.424\nfor one out of three subjects.\n\n00:03:29.424 --> 00:03:32.608\nSo essentially, we can start from an anonymous face,\n\n00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:36.092\noffline or online, and we can use facial recognition\n\n00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:38.452\nto give a name to that anonymous face\n\n00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.560\nthanks to social media data.\n\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.432\nBut a few years back, we did something else.\n\n00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:44.255\nWe started from social media data,\n\n00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:47.306\nwe combined it statistically with data\n\n00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:49.408\nfrom U.S. government social security,\n\n00:03:49.408 --> 00:03:52.732\nand we ended up predicting social security numbers,\n\n00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.244\nwhich in the United States\n\n00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.284\nare extremely sensitive information.\n\n00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:58.377\nDo you see where I'm going with this?\n\n00:03:58.377 --> 00:04:01.299\nSo if you combine the two studies together,\n\n00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.811\nthen the question becomes,\n\n00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:05.531\ncan you start from a face and,\n\n00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.842\nusing facial recognition, find a name\n\n00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:10.511\nand publicly available information\n\n00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.443\nabout that name and that person,\n\n00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.691\nand from that publicly available information\n\n00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.733\ninfer non-publicly available information,\n\n00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.339\nmuch more sensitive ones\n\n00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.831\nwhich you link back to the face?\n\n00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.747\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can, and we did.\n\n00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:24.315\nOf course, the accuracy keeps getting worse.\n\n00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:25.259\n[27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)]\n\n00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.086\nBut in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app\n\n00:04:29.086 -->

00:04:37.550\nand then do what I just described to you in real time:\n\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.638\nlooking for a match, finding public information,\n\n00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.368\ntrying to infer sensitive information,\n\n00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:43.959\nand then sending back to the phone\n\n00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.568\nso that it is overlaid on the face of the subject,\n\n00:04:47.568

should we care?\n\n00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.522\nWe may like to believe\n\n00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.562\nthat the future with so much wealth of data\n\n00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.076\nwould be a

00:05:39.556\nwhich are more objective.\n\n00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:42.116\nIn another experiment, we presented to our subjects\n\n00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:44.362\ninformation about a potential job candidate.\n\n00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:47.540\nWe included in this information some references\n\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.186\nto some funny, absolutely legal,\n\n00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:52.651\nbut perhaps slightly embarrassing information\n\n00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:54.671\nthat the subject had posted online.\n\n00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:57.037\nNow interestingly, among our subjects,\n\n00:05:57.037

00:06:08.983\nwas more likely to judge harshly our subject?\n\n00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:10.940\nParadoxically, it was the group\n\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.673\nwho had posted similar

What makes us who we are anyway?HP: (In Chinese)YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics, watch kung fu movies, take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee. He would say things like \u2014HP: Empty your mind. (Laughter) Be formless, shapeless, like water. Now you put water into a cup. It becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. (Applause)YR: This year, I am 32 years old, the same age Bruce Lee was when he died. I have been wondering recently, if he were alive today, what advice he would give me about making this TED Talk.HP: Don't imitate my voice. It offends me.(Laughter)YR: Good advice, but I still think that we learn who we are by copying others. Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero in the playground, or mum or father? I have.HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U.K. in the 1960s. He had a side parting and a neat mustache.At first, it was going very well. I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.(Laughter)But then very quickly, I started to underestimate my mustache growing ability, and it got way too big. It didn't look Indian anymore. Instead, people from across the road, they would shout things like \u2014HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! \u00c1ndale! \u00c1ndale!(Laughter)HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this. My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore. He talks like this now.So it's not just my father that I've imitated. A few years ago I went to China for a few months, and I couldn't speak Chinese, and this frustrated me, so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart, like music, I guess.YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card, so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently. When I had learned this phrase, I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded.I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed and told me, \"Oh yeah, that's great, only it kind of sounds like a woman.\"I said, \"What?\"He said, \"Yeah, you learned from a woman?\"I said, \"Yes. So?\"He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice.(Laughter)(Applause)HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. It doesn't always go as you plan it, even with a talented translator. But I am going to stick with it, because contrary to what we might usually assume, imitating somebody can reveal something unique. So every time I fail to become more like my father, I become more like myself. Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee, I become more authentically me.This is my art. I strive for authenticity, even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect. It's only recently that I've started to understand that I didn't learn to sit like this through being Indian. I learned this from Spider-Man.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1849, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:23.261\nHetain Patel: (In Chinese)\n\n00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.564\nYuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain.

I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group. I worked on forestry issues in WWF. I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. About 25 years in total, and then three years ago, I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. Like many people here, well, I want to maximize my personal impact in the world, so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.But first, let's just take three numbers.The first number is three: three billion people. This is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030, coming out of poverty. It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.The second number is six: This is six degrees centigrade, what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees. And if you think about it, all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years, much of that is due to just one degree warming, and we need CO2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.The third number is 12: That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born. You can see my grandmother there. That was in the beginning of the last century. So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England, the ninth largest city in the world. Now there are 500 cities, nearly, with a million people or more in them. And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050, that's the century when we build all the world's cities, the century that we're in the middle of right now. Every other century was kind of practice, and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.So think about it. We're building cities like never before, bringing people out of poverty like never before, and changing the climate like never before. Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do. it's about what we do right here, right now, and for the rest of our working lives.So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do, and we have a sustainability strategy called \"people and planet positive\" to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world. Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business? Other companies have sustainability strategies. I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.But first, let's think of customers. We know from asking people from China to the U.S. that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day-to-day issues, the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school? Can I pay the bills at the end of the month? Then they care about big issues like climate change. But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive, and they expect business to help, and they're a little bit disappointed today.So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer. We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color. And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper. So every time you pulled on a t-shirt, or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom, or sometimes all three together, you were reminded sustainability was about compromise. It wasn't a great start.Today we have choices. We can make products that are beautiful or ugly, sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive, functional or useless. So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable, sustainable products.Let's take the LED. The LED is the next best thing to daylight. The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs \u2014 I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes, wasting energy every time you switch them on \u2014 change them after this \u2014 or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not \u2014 but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years. They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. And the best thing is, they'll also last for more than 20 years. So think about that. You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times, probably more if you're in this audience. You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times. Your kids could go to school, go to college, go away and have kids of their own, come back, bring the grandkids, you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy. So LEDs are fantastic. What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs, the halogens and the CFLs. We decided, over the next two years, we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. We will go all in. And this is what business needs to do: go all-in, go 100 percent, because then you stop investing in the old stuff, you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs, you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy.(Applause)It's not just about products in people's homes. We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products. Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials, and we can and will go zero waste. And there's opportunities in a circular economy. But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials. Let's take cotton. Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now. It's a brilliant textile in use. It's really dirty in production. It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water. So we've worked with others, with other businesses and NGOs, on the Better Cotton Initiative, working right back down to the farm, and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs, the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports. Yields increase, and you halve the input costs. Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached, and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business. Again, we're going all-in. By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually. People sometimes think that 100 percent's going to be hard, and we've had the conversation in the business. Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent. If you have a 90 percent target, everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the 10 percent. When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear, and businesspeople like clarity, because then you just get the job done.So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice. You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale, or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry that we can be proud of. It's a simple choice, so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council, with literally hundreds of other organizations, and there's a point here about collaboration. So hundreds of others, of NGOs, of forest workers' unions, and of businesses, have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council, which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. Now together, through our supply chain, with partners, we've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry. That's about the size of Germany. And we've decided in the next three years, we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. So be decisive on these issues. Use your supply chain to drive good.But then it comes to your operations. Some things are certain, I think. We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time. We know the sun will be shining somewhere, and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time. So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind? And why not take control of it ourselves? So we're going 100 percent renewable. By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. For all of our stores, our own factories, our distribution centers, we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far, and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate in six countries, and we're not done yet. But think of a solar panel. A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years. The electricity is free. Every time the sun comes out after that, the electricity is free. So this is a good thing for the CFO, not just the sustainability guy. Every business can do things like this.But then we've got to look beyond our operations, and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain. Many businesses now, fortunately, have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains, but not every business. Far from it. And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s. We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain, and people in the business were shocked. And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act. So a code of conduct was developed, and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor.But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. You've got to say that's not enough today. I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable. So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights? We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these, but actually in a survey, many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children. So what we decided to do was, we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us, what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children? We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015.You know the phrase, you can manage what you measure? Well, you should measure what you care about. If you're not measuring things, you don't care and you don't know. So let's take an example, measure the things that are important in your business. Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women?(Applause)So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA that 47 percent are women today, but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management. And we do not want to wait another hundred years. So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA, and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change. So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years.So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do. It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do. And everybody can do something on this as an individual. Be a discerning consumer. Vote with your wallets. Search out the companies that are acting on this. But also, there are other businesses already acting. I mentioned renewable energy. You go to Google or Lego, they're going 100 percent renewable too, in the same way that we are. On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks & Spencer. But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't. We'll make mistakes going forward, but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent, having a dialogue with the right partners, and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.So if you're a business leader, if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model, I'd urge you to do so. And together, we can help create a sustainable world, and, if we get it right, we can make sustainability affordable for the many people, not a luxury for the few.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1850, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:15.005\nI've spent my life working on sustainability.\n\n00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.060\nI set up a climate change NGO\n\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.380\ncalled The Climate Group.\n\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.771\nI worked on forestry issues in WWF.\n\n00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.847\nI worked on development and agriculture issues\n\n00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:25.582\nin the U.N. system.\n\n00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:27.506\nAbout 25 years in total,\n\n00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:30.229\nand then three years ago, I found myself talking to\n\n00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.514\nIKEA's CEO about joining his team.\n\n00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:35.540\nLike many people here, well,\n\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.475\nI want to maximize my personal impact in the world,\n\n00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:44.161\nso I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.\n\n00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.968\nBut first, let's just take three numbers.\n\n00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:49.039\nThe first number is three:\n\n00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.599\nthree billion people.\n\n00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.410\nThis is the number of people joining\n\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.462\nthe global middle class by 2030,\n\n00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:55.771\ncoming out of poverty.\n\n00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.012\nIt's fantastic for them and their families,\n\n00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:01.055\nbut we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,\n\n00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.352\nand this swells that number to five,\n\n00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:06.682\na big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.\n\n00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:08.559\nThe second number is six:\n\n00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:10.704\nThis is six degrees centigrade,\n\n00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:13.268\nwhat we're heading towards in terms of global warming.\n\n00:01:13.268 --> 00:01:15.319\nWe're not heading towards one degree or three degrees\n\n00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.667\nor four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.\n\n00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.356\nAnd if you think about it, all of the weird weather\n\n00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:22.199\nwe've been having the last few years,\n\n00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:24.781\nmuch of that is due to just one degree warming,\n\n00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.076\nand we need CO2 emissions to peak\n\n00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.308\nby the end of this decade globally\n\n00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:31.036\nand then come down.\n\n00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:35.107\nIt's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.\n\n00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:36.868\nThe third number is 12:\n\n00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:38.361\nThat's the number of cities in the world\n\n00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.152\nthat had a million or more people\n\n00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:41.585\nwhen my grandmother was born.\n\n00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:43.205\nYou can see my grandmother there.\n\n00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.248\nThat was in the beginning of the last century.\n\n00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.264\nSo just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,\n\n00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:49.285\nthe ninth largest city in the world.\n\n00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.990\nNow there are 500 cities, nearly,\n\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.421\nwith a million people or more in them.\n\n00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.765\nAnd if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,\n\n00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:01.509\nthat's the century when we build all the world's cities,\n\n00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.919\nthe century that we're in the middle of right now.\n\n00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.765\nEvery other century was kind of practice,\n\n00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:11.583\nand this lays down a blueprint for how we live.\n\n00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.338\nSo think about it.\n\n00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:16.108\nWe're building cities like never before,\n\n00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.634\nbringing people out of poverty like never before,\n\n00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:21.009\nand changing the climate like never before.\n\n00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.069\nSustainability has gone from a nice-to-do\n\n00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.734\nto a must-do.\n\n00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.567\nit's about what we do right here, right now,\n\n00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:32.248\nand for the rest of our working lives.\n\n00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.280\nSo I'm going to talk a little bit about\n\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.653\nwhat business can do\n\n00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:37.955\nand what a business like IKEA can do,\n\n00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.622\nand we have a sustainability strategy\n\n00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:42.619\ncalled \"people and planet positive\"\n\n00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.266\nto help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.\n\n00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.401\nWhy would we not want to have a positive impact\n\n00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.989\non the world as a business?\n\n00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.477\nOther companies have sustainability strategies.\n\n00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.315\nI'm going to refer to some of those as well,\n\n00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:56.852\nand I'm just going to mention a few\n\n00:02:56.852 --> 00:02:59.448\nof the commitments as illustrations that we've got.\n\n00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:01.464\nBut first, let's think of customers.\n\n00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:05.289\nWe know from asking people from China to the U.S.\n\n00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.617\nthat the vast majority of people care about sustainability\n\n00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:10.499\nafter the day-to-day issues,\n\n00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.076\nthe day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?\n\n00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:15.055\nCan I pay the bills at the end of the month?\n\n00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:18.517\nThen they care about big issues like climate change.\n\n00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:22.949\nBut they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,\n\n00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.941\nand they expect business to help,\n\n00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.735\nand they're a little bit disappointed today.\n\n00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:30.369\nSo take your mind back and think\n\n00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:31.956\nof the first sustainable products.\n\n00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:35.869\nWe had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.\n\n00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.923\nWe had the early energy-efficient light bulbs\n\n00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.770\nthat took five minutes to warm up\n\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.841\nand then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.\n\n00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:47.209\nAnd we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.\n\n00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.941\nSo every time you pulled on a t-shirt,\n\n00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.047\nor switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,\n\n00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:53.716\nor sometimes all three together,\n\n00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:57.161\nyou were reminded sustainability was about compromise.\n\n00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.059\nIt wasn't a great start.\n\n00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.347\nToday we have choices.\n\n00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:05.644\nWe can make products that are beautiful or ugly,\n\n00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:10.445\nsustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,\n\n00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.308\nfunctional or useless.\n\n00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:15.173\nSo let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,\n\n00:04:15.173 --> 00:04:17.493\nsustainable products.\n\n00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:19.789\nLet's take the LED.\n\n00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.203\nThe LED is the next best thing to daylight.\n\n00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:26.384\nThe old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --\n\n00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:27.892\nI'm not going to ask for a show of hands\n\n00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.181\nof how many of you still have them in your homes,\n\n00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.003\nwasting energy every time you switch them on --\n\n00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:34.440\nchange them after this --\n\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.133\nor whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --\n\n00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:41.924\nbut those old incandescent light bulbs\n\n00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:44.946\nreally should have been sold as heaters.\n\n00:04:44.946 --> 00:04:46.923\nThey were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.\n\n00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:49.365\nThey produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.\n\n00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:51.437\nNow we have lights that produce light\n\n00:04:51.437 --> 00:04:53.129\nand a little bit of heat on the side.\n\n00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.955\nYou save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED\n\n00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:57.998\nthat you would have done in an old incandescent.\n\n00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:59.733\nAnd the best thing is, they'll also last\n\n00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.312\nfor more than 20 years.\n\n00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:02.568\nSo think about that.\n\n00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:05.064\nYou'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,\n\n00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:07.140\nprobably more if you're in this audience.\n\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.750\nYou'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.\n\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.302\nYour kids could go to school, go to college,\n\n00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:14.257\ngo away and have kids of their own, come back,\n\n00:05:14.257 --> 00:05:15.683\nbring the grandkids,\n\n00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:19.569\nyou'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.\n\n00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.408\nSo LEDs are fantastic.\n\n00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:23.934\nWhat we decided to do\n\n00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.887\nwas not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high\n\n00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:29.113\nand continue to push all the old bulbs,\n\n00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:31.104\nthe halogens and the CFLs.\n\n00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:34.034\nWe decided, over the next two years,\n\n00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.549\nwe will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.\n\n00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:37.917\nWe will go all in.\n\n00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:39.626\nAnd this is what business needs to do: go all-in,\n\n00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.070\ngo 100 percent,\n\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.661\nbecause then you stop investing in the old stuff,\n\n00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:44.815\nyou invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,\n\n00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:47.144\nyou use your supply chain and your creativity\n\n00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:49.901\nand you get the prices down so everybody can afford\n\n00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:52.852\nthe best lights so they can save energy.\n\n00:05:52.852 -->

--> 00:06:03.957\nthat produce our products.\n\n00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:05.784\nObviously there's fantastic opportunities\n\n00:06:05.784 --> 00:06:07.278\nwith recycled materials,\n\n00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:10.121\nand we can and will go zero waste.\n\n00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:12.109\nAnd there's opportunities in a circular economy.\n\n00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:15.551\nBut we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.\n\n00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:17.341\nLet's take cotton.\n\n00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:19.070\nCotton's brilliant. Probably many people\n\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.481\nare wearing cotton right now.\n\n00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.015\nIt's a brilliant textile in use.\n\n00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.582\nIt's really dirty in production.\n\n00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:27.716\nIt uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.\n\n00:06:27.716 --> 00:06:29.336\nSo we've worked with others,\n\n00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:30.938\nwith other businesses and NGOs,\n\n00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:32.794\non the Better Cotton Initiative,\n\n00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:34.963\nworking right back down to the farm,\n\n00:06:34.963 --> 00:06:36.798\nand there you can halve the amount of water\n\n00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:38.629\nand halve the chemical inputs,\n\n00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.525\nthe yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs\n\n00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:43.194\nof running many of these farms\n\n00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.238\nwith farmers with low incomes\n\n00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.941\ncan be chemical imports.\n\n00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.086\nYields increase, and you halve the input costs.\n\n00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:51.961\nFarmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.\n\n00:06:51.961 --> 00:06:53.688\nAlready hundreds of thousands of farmers\n\n00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:55.278\nhave been reached,\n\n00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:57.942\nand now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.\n\n00:06:57.942 --> 00:06:59.284\nAgain, we're going all-in.\n\n00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:02.434\nBy 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.\n\n00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:05.420\nTake the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.\n\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.092\nPeople sometimes think that\n\n00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:08.557\n100 percent's going to be hard,\n\n00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:10.328\nand we've had the conversation in the business.\n\n00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:12.170\nActually, we found 100 percent is easier to do\n\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.157\nthan 90 percent or 50 percent.\n\n00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:15.589\nIf you have a 90 percent target,\n\n00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:17.010\neveryone in the business finds a reason\n\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.815\nto be in the 10 percent.\n\n00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:22.385\nWhen it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,\n\n00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:25.275\nand businesspeople like clarity,\n\n00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:27.940\nbecause then you just get the job done.\n\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.688\nSo, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.\n\n00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:32.282\nYou've got illegal logging\n\n00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:35.107\nand deforestation still on a very large scale,\n\n00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:37.807\nor you can have fantastic, responsible forestry\n\n00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:39.942\nthat we can be proud of.\n\n00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:42.024\nIt's a simple choice, so we've worked\n\n00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:44.568\nfor many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,\n\n00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:46.938\nwith literally hundreds of other organizations,\n\n00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:49.378\nand there's a point here about collaboration.\n\n00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:51.273\nSo hundreds of others, of NGOs,\n\n00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:53.855\nof forest workers' unions, and of businesses,\n\n00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.527\nhave helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,\n\n00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:57.309\nwhich sets standards for forestry\n\n00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.831\nand then checks the forestry's good on the ground.\n\n00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:02.074\nNow together, through our supply chain,\n\n00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:03.941\nwith partners, we've managed to certify\n\n00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.818\n35 million hectares of forestry.\n\n00:08:06.818 --> 00:08:09.355\nThat's about the size of Germany.\n\n00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.143\nAnd we've decided in the next three years,\n\n00:08:11.143 --> 00:08:13.178\nwe will double the volume of certified material\n\n00:08:13.178 --> 00:08:15.316\nwe put through our business.\n\n00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:17.956\nSo be decisive on these issues.\n\n00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.927\nUse your supply chain to drive good.\n\n00:08:19.927 --> 00:08:21.953\nBut then it comes to your operations.\n\n00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:24.603\nSome things are certain, I think.\n\n00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:27.618\nWe know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.\n\n00:08:27.618 --> 00:08:30.541\nWe know the sun will be shining somewhere,\n\n00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:33.633\nand the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.\n\n00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:36.285\nSo why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?\n\n00:08:36.285 --> 00:08:38.513\nAnd why not take control of it ourselves?\n\n00:08:38.513 --> 00:08:40.873\nSo we're going 100 percent renewable.\n\n00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:43.629\nBy 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy\n\n00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.649\nthan the energy we consume as a business.\n\n00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:47.625\nFor all of our stores, our own factories,\n\n00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.003\nour distribution centers,\n\n00:08:49.003 --> 00:08:51.457\nwe've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,\n\n00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:54.831\nand we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate\n\n00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:57.458\nin six countries, and we're not done yet.\n\n00:08:57.458 --> 00:08:59.242\nBut think of a solar panel.\n\n00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:01.421\nA solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.\n\n00:09:01.421 --> 00:09:02.914\nThe electricity is free.\n\n00:09:02.914 --> 00:09:04.719\nEvery time the sun comes out after that,\n\n00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:06.154\nthe electricity is free.\n\n00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:08.171\nSo this is a good thing for the CFO,\n\n00:09:08.171 --> 00:09:10.114\nnot just the sustainability guy.\n\n00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:13.148\nEvery business can do things like this.\n\n00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:16.127\nBut then we've got to look beyond our operations,\n\n00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:17.876\nand I think everybody would agree\n\n00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:20.248\nthat now business has to take full responsibility\n\n00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:22.452\nfor the impacts of your supply chain.\n\n00:09:22.452 --> 00:09:24.768\nMany businesses now, fortunately,\n\n00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:26.775\nhave codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,\n\n00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.821\nbut not every business. Far from it.\n\n00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:31.335\nAnd this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.\n\n00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:33.076\nWe found there was a risk\n\n00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:35.078\nof child labor in the supply chain,\n\n00:09:35.078 --> 00:09:37.588\nand people in the business were shocked.\n\n00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:40.912\nAnd it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.\n\n00:09:40.912 --> 00:09:43.056\nSo a code of conduct was developed,\n\n00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:46.007\nand now we have 80 auditors out in the world\n\n00:09:46.007 --> 00:09:48.038\nevery day making sure all our factories\n\n00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:50.322\nsecure good working conditions\n\n00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:51.871\nand protect human rights\n\n00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.132\nand make sure there is no child labor.\n\n00:09:54.132 --> 00:09:56.292\nBut it's not just as simple as making sure\n\n00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.324\nthere's no child labor.\n\n00:09:58.324 --> 00:10:00.524\nYou've got to say that's not enough today.\n\n00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:02.572\nI think we'd all agree that children\n\n00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.768\nare the most important people in the world\n\n00:10:04.768 --> 00:10:06.665\nand the most vulnerable.\n\n00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.913\nSo what can a business do today\n\n00:10:08.913 --> 00:10:10.797\nto actually use your total value chain\n\n00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:13.076\nto support a better quality of life\n\n00:10:13.076 --> 00:10:14.664\nand protect child rights?\n\n00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:16.961\nWe've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children\n\n00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:19.436\non developing some new business principles\n\n00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:20.901\nwith children's rights.\n\n00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:22.718\nIncreasing numbers of businesses\n\n00:10:22.718 --> 00:10:24.238\nare signing up to these,\n\n00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.701\nbut actually in a survey, many business leaders\n\n00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.568\nsaid they thought their business had nothing to do with children.\n\n00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:33.067\nSo what we decided to do was, we will look\n\n00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.628\nand ask ourselves the tough questions\n\n00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:36.692\nwith partners who know more than us,\n\n00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:39.649\nwhat can we do to go beyond our business\n\n00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:41.491\nto help improve the lives of children?\n\n00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.310\nWe also have a foundation\n\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.205\nthat's committed to work through partners\n\n00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:47.828\nand help improve the lives and protect the rights\n\n00:10:47.828 --> 00:10:50.695\nof 100 million children by 2015.\n\n00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:52.371\nYou know the phrase,\n\n00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:55.749\nyou can manage what you measure?\n\n00:10:55.749 --> 00:11:00.399\nWell, you should measure what you care about.\n\n00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.948\nIf you're not measuring things,\n\n00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:04.692\nyou don't care and you don't know.\n\n00:11:04.692 --> 00:11:06.861\nSo let's take an example, measure the things\n\n00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:09.018\nthat are important in your business.\n\n00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.301\nIsn't it about time that businesses\n\n00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:14.279\nwere led equally by men and women?\n\n00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:17.262\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:22.404\nSo we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA\n\n00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:25.368\nthat 47 percent are women today,\n\n00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:27.764\nbut it's not enough, and we want to close the gap\n\n00:11:27.764 --> 00:11:30.051\nand follow it all the way through to senior management.\n\n00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:32.897\nAnd we do not want to wait another hundred years.\n\n00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:35.856\nSo we've launched a women's open network\n\n00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:37.381\nthis week in IKEA,\n\n00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:39.557\nand we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.\n\n00:11:39.557 --> 00:11:40.972\nSo the message here is,\n\n00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:43.356\nmeasure what you care about and lead the change,\n\n00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:46.359\nand don't wait a hundred years.\n\n00:11:46.359 --> 00:11:48.796\nSo we've gone from sustainability\n\n00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:54.032\nbeing a nice-to-do to a must-do.

Per capita incomes since the year 2000 have doubled, and this boom is impacting on everyone. Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. That means if an African child is born today, rather than three days ago, they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. It's that quick. And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent: 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The battle against malaria is being won, with deaths from malaria down 27 percent, according to the latest World Bank data. And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. This shouldn't surprise us, because actually, everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D., there was admittedly about 1,800 years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth. But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors, were actually part of the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate, and you saw that get quicker and quicker, and it's been impacting everyone. It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens.Among the reasons I think it's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa. I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s, the greatest politician in the world was African, but I'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time, and they're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries.And the West is engaging with that. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-Saharan debt from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40. At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120 and we're all feeling slightly miserable as a result. Politics gets weaker when debt is high. When public sector debt is low, governments don't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good. The private sector as well. Again, in the West, we have private sector debt of 200 percent of GDP in Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. That's an awful lot of debt. Africa, many African countries, are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP. If there's any continent that can do what China has done \u2014 China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart \u2014 if anyone can do what China has done in the last 30 years, it'll be Africa in the next 30.So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt. Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do. Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years. Back in the '70s, no one touched the continent with a barge pole. And this investment is actually Western-led. We hear a lot about China, and they do lend a lot of money, but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada. Ten percent's come from India. And they're investing in energy. Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now. It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And they're investing in telecoms, shopping malls. And this very encouraging story, I think, is partly demographic-led. And it's not just about African demographics. I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory, by chance. You might choose China, which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line, where there's 200 million young people, and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger. Which means you're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying, \"Give us a job,\" and, \"I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job.\" Now, that's completely changed now. This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China. So where do you set up your new factory? You look at South Asia, and people are. They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they're also looking at Africa. And they're looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to 2050.Now, there's a problem with lots of young people coming into any market, particularly when they're young men. A bit dangerous, sometimes. I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic? If you look at the red line here, what you're going to see is that in 1975, just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-Saharan Africa. Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s? Nobody else did. They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories, because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent. Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975. They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.So what's Africa looking like today? This is how I look at Africa. It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist. Each little box is about a billion dollars, and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. South Africa is playing a role. But when I'm thinking about the future, I'm actually most interested in Central, Western and Southern Africa. If I look at Africa by population, East Africa stands out as so much potential.And I'm showing you something else with these maps. I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy. Fragile democracies is the beige color. Strong democracies are the orange color. And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. Why does that matter? Because what people want is what politicians try, they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver. And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on. In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012, the battle between the two candidates was over education. One guy offered free secondary school education to all, not just 30 percent. The other guy had to say, I'm going to build 50 new schools. He won by a margin. So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment, and that's giving budget revenues, which is giving governments more money, which is helping growth through education. It's a positive, virtuous circle.But I get asked this question, and this particular question makes me quite sad: It's, \"But what about corruption? How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?\" And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority. And the countries on the right hand side, you'll see the per capita GDP, basically every country with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars, has got a corruption score of roughly, what's that, about three? Three out of 10. That's not good. Every poor country is corrupt. Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt. How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption? You see the middle class grow. And the way to do that is to invest, not to say I'm not investing in that continent because there's too much corruption.Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe \u2014 not in Africa, actually. But what I'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing.Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret. Economists aren't great at forecasting. Because the question really is, what happens next? And if you go back to the year 2000, what you'll find is The Economist had a very famous cover, \"The Hopeless Continent,\" and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth in Africa over the previous 10 years \u2014 two percent \u2014 and they said, what's going to happen in the next 10 years? They assumed two percent, and that made it a pretty hopeless story, because population growth was two and a half. People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s. Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover, and what does that new cover show? That new cover shows, well, Africa rising, because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent.I would like to see if you can all now become economists, because if growth for the last 10 years has been five and a half percent, what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa? Very good. I think you're secretly saying to your head, probably five and a half percent. You're all economists, and I think, like most economists, wrong. No offense.What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done, and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof. India is one of those examples. This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010. Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second. Actually, for the first 20 years, the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow. It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half. If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s. And then something happened in 1980. Boom! India began to explode. It wasn't a \"Hindu rate of growth,\" \"democracies can't grow.\" Actually India could. And if I lay sub-Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story, it's remarkably similar. Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub-Saharan African growth is slightly better than India. And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this, I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa, I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India, I can draw out some forecasts for the next 30 to 40 years which I think are better than the ones where you're looking backwards. And that tells me this: that Africa is going to go from a $2 trillion economy today to a $29 trillion economy by 2050. Now that's bigger than Europe and America put together in today's money. Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years. The population's going to double from one billion to two billion, so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next 35 years. And when I present this in Africa \u2014 Nairobi, Lagos, Accra \u2014 I get one question. \"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?\"And you know what? Actually, I think they've got a point. Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned, yes from the positives in Asia and India, but also the negatives? Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made. Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here this last week, surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster? And I think here we can play a role. Because technology does let you help. You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now. No, not right now, just 30 seconds. You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPod's full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that's happening. Invest. Perhaps hire people, give them the skills that they can take back to Africa, and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1851, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:14.319\nAfrica is booming.\n\n00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.824\nPer capita incomes since the year 2000\n\n00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:18.424\nhave doubled,\n\n00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:21.799\nand this boom is impacting on everyone.\n\n00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:24.625\nLife expectancy has increased by one year\n\n00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.375\nevery three years for the last decade.\n\n00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.860\nThat means if an African child is born today,\n\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.648\nrather than three days ago,\n\n00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.535\nthey will get an extra day of life\n\n00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.558\nat the end of their lifespan.\n\n00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:38.349\nIt's that quick.\n\n00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:42.461\nAnd HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:\n\n00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:46.711\n600,000 less people a year are getting HIV\n\n00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.175\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.237\nThe battle against malaria is being won,\n\n00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:55.037\nwith deaths from malaria down 27 percent,\n\n00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:56.799\naccording to the latest World Bank data.\n\n00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.896\nAnd malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.\n\n00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.068\nThis shouldn't surprise us,\n\n00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:04.817\nbecause actually, everybody grows.\n\n00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:06.793\nIf you go back to Imperial Rome\n\n00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:08.998\nin the Year 1 A.D.,\n\n00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:11.296\nthere was admittedly about 1,800 years\n\n00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.543\nwhere there wasn't an awful lot of growth.\n\n00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:15.535\nBut then the people that the Romans\n\n00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:19.350\nwould have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,\n\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.470\nwere actually part of the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.158\nand in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,\n\n00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:27.198\nand you saw that get quicker and quicker,\n\n00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:29.958\nand it's been impacting everyone.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.573\nIt doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore\n\n00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.823\nor the tundra of northern Finland.\n\n00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:37.744\nEverybody gets involved.

is that demographic?\n\n00:05:16.853 --> 00:05:18.785\nIf you look at the red line here,\n\n00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.461\nwhat you're going to see is that in 1975,\n\n00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:22.550\njust nine percent of kids\n\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.950\nwere in secondary school education\n\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.608\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:05:27.608 --> 00:05:29.375\nWould you set up a factory\n\n00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:31.265\nin sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?\n\n00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:32.585\nNobody else did.\n\n00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:35.238\nThey

00:05:42.093\nwere 25 to 30 percent.\n\n00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:45.554\nToday, sub-Sahara is at the levels\n\n00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:49.290\nthat Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.\n\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.469\nThey will get the textiles jobs\n\n00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.149\nthat will take people out of rural poverty\n\n00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:59.813\nand put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.\n\n00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:02.872\nSo what's Africa looking like today?\n\n00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:04.533\nThis is how I look at Africa.\n\n00:06:04.533 --> 00:06:06.357\nIt's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.\n\n00:06:06.357 --> 00:06:08.268\nEach little box is about a billion dollars,\n\n00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:09.985\nand you see that I pay an awful lot of attention\n\n00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:12.277\nto Nigeria sitting there in the middle.\n\n00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:14.442\nSouth Africa is playing a role.\n\n00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.521\nBut when I'm thinking about the future,\n\n00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:19.072\nI'm actually most interested\n\n00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:21.837\nin Central, Western and Southern Africa.\n\n00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:24.399\nIf I look at Africa by population,\n\n00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.768\nEast Africa stands out\n\n00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:27.752\nas so much potential.\n\n00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:30.784\nAnd I'm showing you something else with these maps.\n\n00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:33.526\nI'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.\n\n00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.779\nFragile democracies is the beige color.\n\n00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.422\nStrong democracies are the orange color.\n\n00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:42.152\nAnd what you'll see here is that most Africans\n\n00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:45.971\nare now living in democracies.\n\n00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:48.147\nWhy does that matter?\n\n00:06:48.147 --> 00:06:50.581\nBecause what people want\n\n00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:52.716\nis what politicians try,\n\n00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:55.807\nthey don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.\n\n00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:58.454\nAnd what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.\n\n00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:01.330\nIn Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,\n\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.560\nthe battle between the two candidates\n\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.833\nwas over education.\n\n00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.826\nOne guy offered free secondary school education\n\n00:07:08.826 --> 00:07:11.174\nto all, not just 30 percent.\n\n00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:12.493\nThe other guy had to say,\n\n00:07:12.493 --> 00:07:14.620\nI'm going to build 50 new schools.\n\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.479\nHe won by a margin.\n\n00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.529\nSo democracy is encouraging governments\n\n00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.129\nto invest in education.\n\n00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.214\nEducation is helping growth and investment,\n\n00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:25.626\nand that's giving budget revenues,\n\n00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.465\nwhich is giving governments more money,\n\n00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:30.671\nwhich is helping growth through education.\n\n00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.206\nIt's a positive, virtuous circle.\n\n00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:35.767\nBut I get asked this question,\n\n00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:38.853\nand this particular question makes me quite sad:\n\n00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:41.384\nIt's, \"But what about corruption?\n\n00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:45.488\nHow can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?\"\n\n00:07:45.488 --> 00:07:47.129\nAnd what makes me sad about it\n\n00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.154\nis that this graph here is showing you\n\n00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:53.119\nthat the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.\n\n00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:57.665\nWhen you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.\n\n00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:59.778\nAnd the countries on the right hand side,\n\n00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:01.501\nyou'll see the per capita GDP,\n\n00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:03.326\nbasically every country\n\n00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:06.821\nwith a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,\n\n00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.041\nhas got a corruption score\n\n00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:12.076\nof roughly, what's that, about three?\n\n00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:14.359\nThree out of 10. That's not good.\n\n00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:16.707\nEvery poor country is corrupt.\n\n00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:20.849\nEvery rich country is relatively uncorrupt.\n\n00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:24.852\nHow do you get from poverty and corruption\n\n00:08:24.852 --> 00:08:27.121\nto wealth and less corruption?\n\n00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:29.313\nYou see the middle class grow.\n\n00:08:29.313 --> 00:08:32.800\nAnd the way to do that is to invest,\n\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.180\nnot to say I'm not investing in that continent\n\n00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.457\nbecause there's too much corruption.\n\n00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:41.134\nNow, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.\n\n00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:44.073\nI've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --\n\n00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:46.185\nnot in Africa, actually.\n\n00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:47.883\nBut what I'm saying here is that\n\n00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:49.673\nwe can make a difference\n\n00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:52.579\nand we can do that by investing.\n\n00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:56.086\nNow I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.\n\n00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:58.953\nEconomists aren't great at forecasting.\n\n00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:01.065\nBecause the question really is, what happens next?\n\n00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:03.589\nAnd if you go back to the year 2000,\n\n00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:05.352\nwhat you'll find is The Economist\n\n00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:08.520\nhad a very famous cover, \"The Hopeless Continent,\"\n\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.702\nand what they'd done is they'd looked at growth\n\n00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:14.832\nin Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --\n\n00:09:14.832 --> 00:09:16.936\nand they said,\n\n00:09:16.936 --> 00:09:19.469\nwhat's going to happen in the next 10 years?\n\n00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:21.848\nThey assumed two percent,\n\n00:09:21.848 --> 00:09:23.741\nand that made it a pretty hopeless story,\n\n00:09:23.741 --> 00:09:26.891\nbecause population growth was two and a half.\n\n00:09:26.891 --> 00:09:29.671\nPeople got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.\n\n00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:33.109\nNow 2012, The Economist has a new cover,\n\n00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:34.955\nand what does that new cover show?\n\n00:09:34.955 --> 00:09:37.938\nThat new cover shows, well, Africa rising,\n\n00:09:37.938 --> 00:09:39.665\nbecause the growth over the last 10 years\n\n00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:42.285\nhas been about five and a half percent.\n\n00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:45.811\nI would like to see if you can all now become economists,\n\n00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:48.326\nbecause if growth for the last 10 years\n\n00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:50.446\nhas been five and a half percent,\n\n00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.149\nwhat do you think the IMF is forecasting\n\n00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:55.169\nfor the next five years of growth in Africa?\n\n00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:57.944\nVery good. I think you're secretly saying\n\n00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:00.126\nto your head, probably five and a half percent.\n\n00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.068\nYou're all economists, and I think,\n\n00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.550\nlike most economists, wrong.\n\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.646\nNo offense.\n\n00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:09.527\nWhat I like to do is try and find the countries\n\n00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:13.688\nthat are doing exactly what Africa has already done,\n\n00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:17.086\nand it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing\n\n00:10:17.086 --> 00:10:20.133\nto whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.\n\n00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:22.787\nIndia is one of those examples.\n\n00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:26.906\nThis is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.\n\n00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:29.820\nIgnore the scale on the bottom for a second.\n\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.190\nActually, for the first 20 years,\n\n00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.233\nthe '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.\n\n00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.294\nIt grew at two percent\n\n00:10:37.294 --> 00:10:40.374\nwhen population growth was about two and a half.\n\n00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:42.554\nIf that's familiar, that's exactly what happened\n\n00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:44.849\nin sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.\n\n00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:46.623\nAnd then something happened in 1980.\n\n00:10:46.623 --> 00:10:48.846\nBoom! India began to explode.\n\n00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.130\nIt wasn't a \"Hindu rate of growth,\"\n\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.186\n\"democracies can't grow.\" Actually India could.\n\n00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.992\nAnd if I lay sub-Saharan growth\n\n00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:59.260\non top of the Indian growth story,\n\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.876\nit's remarkably similar.\n\n00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:04.163\nTwenty years of not much growth\n\n00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.717\nand a trend line which is actually telling you\n\n00:11:05.717 --> 00:11:07.707\nthat sub-Saharan African growth is\n\n00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:10.268\nslightly better than India.\n\n00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:13.703\nAnd if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,\n\n00:11:13.703 --> 00:11:16.527\nI'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,\n\n00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:20.633\nI'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,\n\n00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:22.810\nI can draw out some forecasts\n\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.130\nfor the next 30 to 40 years\n\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.200\nwhich I think are better\n\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.052\nthan the ones where you're looking backwards.\n\n00:11:30.052 --> 00:11:32.399\nAnd that tells me this:\n\n00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.181\nthat Africa is going to go\n\n00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:37.218\nfrom a $2 trillion economy today\n\n00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:41.490\nto a $29 trillion economy by 2050.\n\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.498\nNow that's bigger than Europe and America\n\n00:11:43.498 --> 00:11:46.956\nput together in today's money.\n\n00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.876\nLife expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.\n\n00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.614\nThe population's going to double\n\n00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:54.067\nfrom one billion to two billion,\n\n00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:57.417\nso household incomes are going to go up sevenfold\n\n00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:00.281\nin the next 35 years.\n\n00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:03.398\nAnd when I present this in Africa --\n\n00:12:03.398 --> 00:12:07.202\nNairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.\n\n00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:12.070\n\"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?\"\n\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.913\nAnd you know what?\n\n00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:16.302\nActually, I think they've got a point.\n\n00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.774\nAm I really saying that there can be nothing learned,\n\n00:12:18.774 --> 00:12:22.058\nyes from the positives in Asia and India,\n\n00:12:22.058 --> 00:12:23.436\nbut also the negatives?\n\n00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:25.998\nPerhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.\n\n00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:29.393\nSurely, the technologies that we're talking about here\n\n00:12:29.393 --> 00:12:31.002\nthis last week,\n\n00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:32.946\nsurely some of these can perhaps\n\n00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:35.674\nhelp Africa grow even faster?\n\n00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:38.109\nAnd I think here we can play a role.\n\n00:12:38.109 --> 00:12:40.952\nBecause technology does let you help.\n\n00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:43.091\nYou can go and download\n\n00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:45.126\nsome of the great African literature\n\n00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:46.925\nfrom the Internet now.\n\n00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:49.398\nNo, not right now, just 30 seconds.\n\n00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:51.588\nYou can go and buy some of the great tunes.\n\n00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:53.319\nMy iPod's full of them.\n\n00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:55.009\nBuy African products.\n\n00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.974\nGo on holiday and see for yourself\n\n00:12:56.974 --> 00:12:58.523\nthe change that's happening.\n\n00:12:58.523 --> 00:12:59.928\nInvest.\n\n00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:02.054\nPerhaps hire people, give them the skills\n\n00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:04.323\nthat they can take back to Africa,\n\n00:13:04.323 --> 00:13:06.588\nand their companies will grow an awful lot faster\n\n00:13:06.588 --> 00:13:09.238\nthan most of ours here in the West.\n\n00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:13.539\nAnd then you and I can help make sure\n\n00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:17.668\nthat for Africa, the 21st century is their century.\n\n00:13:17.668 --> 00:13:19.478\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:19.478 --> 00:13:23.478\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "An ode to envy", "duration": "791", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/parul_sehgal_an_ode_to_envy", "transcript": "So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's. (Laughter) And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well.And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? Well no faithless Helen, no \"Odyssey.\" No jealous king, no \"Arabian Nights.\" No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing \"Sound and the Fury,\" we're losing \"Gatsby,\" \"Sun Also Rises,\" we're losing \"Madame Bovary,\" \"Anna K.\" No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, \"In Search of Lost Time,\" and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. (Laughter) And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable.Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood.In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, \"Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now.\" And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his \"collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.\"Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right? Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.And what does jealousy like? Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter) Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. He says, \"You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.\" He says, \"They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.\" Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says, \"A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.\" Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity?Freud would write about this later. One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless; everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? [Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious.The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration. (Laughter) Because, I mean, let's be real. What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right? This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character. Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. That's one way to go.But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy?Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him. Oh, it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,\" once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, \"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you.\" And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though? What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it.But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you.

And now, I mean,\n\n00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:09.869\nI know it's fashionable to say that Proust\n\n00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.476\nhas the answers to everything,\n\n00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:14.182\nbut in the case of jealousy,\n\n00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:16.923\nhe kind of does.\n\n00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:20.909\nThis year is the centennial of his masterpiece, \"In Search of Lost Time,\"\n\n00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.910\nand it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy\n\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.062\nand just regular competitiveness, my brand,\n\n00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:29.647\nthat we can hope to have. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:32.074\nAnd we think about Proust, we think\n\n00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:33.568\nabout the sentimental bits, right?\n\n00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:35.523\nWe think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.\n\n00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:39.704\nWe think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.\n\n00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:41.730\nWe forget how harsh his vision was.\n\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.570\nWe forget how pitiless he is.\n\n00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.891\nI mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said\n\n00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.227\nwere tough as cat gut.\n\n00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.275\nI don't know what cat gut is,\n\n00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:53.176\nbut let's assume it's formidable.\n\n00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:56.394\nLet's look at why they go so well together,\n\n00:03:56.394 --> 00:04:00.072\nthe novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.\n\n00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:03.303\nIs it something as obvious as that jealousy,\n\n00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:06.686\nwhich boils down into person, desire, impediment,\n\n00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:11.354\nis such a solid narrative foundation?\n\n00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:14.029\nI don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,\n\n00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.078\nbecause let's think about what happens\n\n00:04:16.078 --> 00:04:17.856\nwhen we feel jealous.\n\n00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:21.808\nWhen we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.\n\n00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:26.091\nWe tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,\n\n00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:28.765\nand these stories make us feel terrible\n\n00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:30.988\nbecause they're designed to make us feel terrible.\n\n00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:33.522\nAs the teller of the tale and the audience,\n\n00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:35.496\nwe know just what details to include,\n\n00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:39.065\nto dig that knife in. Right?\n\n00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:42.420\nJealousy makes us all amateur novelists,\n\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.436\nand this is something Proust understood.\n\n00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:47.609\nIn the first volume, Swann's Way,\n\n00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:49.433\nthe series of books,\n\n00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.139\nSwann, one of the main characters,\n\n00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.367\nis thinking very fondly of his mistress\n\n00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.059\nand how great she is in bed,\n\n00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.101\nand suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,\n\n00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:01.142\nand these are Proustian sentences,\n\n00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:02.654\nso they're long as rivers,\n\n00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:04.917\nbut in the course of a few sentences,\n\n00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:07.324\nhe suddenly recoils and he realizes,\n\n00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:10.607\n\"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,\n\n00:05:10.607 --> 00:05:14.378\nsomebody else would love about this woman.\n\n00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:17.469\nEverything that she does that gives me pleasure\n\n00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.178\ncould be giving somebody else pleasure,\n\n00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:21.456\nmaybe right about now.\"\n\n00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:24.240\nAnd this is the story he starts to tell himself,\n\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.103\nand from then on, Proust writes that\n\n00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:29.150\nevery fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,\n\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.814\nhe adds to his \"collection of instruments\n\n00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:35.436\nin his private torture chamber.\"\n\n00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:37.711\nNow Swann and Proust, we have to admit,\n\n00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:39.387\nwere notoriously jealous.\n\n00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:41.091\nYou know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave\n\n00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.695\nthe country if they wanted to break up with him.\n\n00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:46.598\nBut you don't have to be that jealous\n\n00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:49.509\nto concede that it's hard work.

It was a historical day. There's no doubt that from now on, the Fourth of July will be remembered not as the day of the Declaration of Independence, but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson. Well, at least, here at CERN.But for me, the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. In the eye of a theoretical physicist, the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass, but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution. Too many questions are left unanswered. The Higgs boson does not share the beauty, the symmetry, the elegance, of the rest of the elementary particle world. For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the Higgs boson could not be the full story. We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. Instead, so far, the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena.Of course, the verdict is not definitive. In 2015, the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons, and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world, and we will certainly learn much more.But for the moment, since we have found no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose that the particles that we know today, including the Higgs boson, are the only elementary particles in nature, even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe, and to explain my point, let me first tell you what the Higgs is about, and to do so, we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. And according to the Higgs theory, at that instant, a dramatic event took place in the universe. Space-time underwent a phase transition. It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees. But in our case, the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material, but is about a change of the very fabric of space-time.During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality. It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room. And some elementary particles interact with this substance, gaining energy in the process. And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle, and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real, because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of. And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.But this story is far more interesting than that. By studying the Higgs theory, theoretical physicists discovered, not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics, that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today. Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid, so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time, could exist in two states. Besides the known Higgs state, there could be a second state in which the Higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today, and the mere existence of another state of the Higgs field poses a potential problem. This is because, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, it is possible to have transitions between two states, even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states, and the phenomenon is called, quite appropriately, quantum tunneling. Because of quantum tunneling, I could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room, practically penetrating the wall. But don't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes, because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small. You would have to wait a really long time before it happens, but believe me, quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon, and it has been observed in many systems. For instance, the tunnel diode, a component used in electronics, works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling.But let's go back to the Higgs field. If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed, then, because of quantum tunneling, a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time, and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water. Bubbles of vapor form inside the water, then they expand, turning liquid into gas. In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light, invading all space, and turning the Higgs field from the familiar state into a new state.Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem. We may not realize it in ordinary life, but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical for the structure of matter. If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense, we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating, and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe. And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state, is not just a few times more intense than today, but billions of times, and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state, all atomic matter would collapse. No molecular structures would be possible, no life.So, I wonder, is it possible that in the future, the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and, through quantum tunneling, will be transformed into this nasty, ultra-dense state? In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate of the Higgs field in our universe? And the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass. And experiments at the LHC found that the mass of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV. This is tiny when expressed in familiar units, because it's equal to something like 10 to the minus 22 grams, but it is large in particle physics units, because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a DNA constituent.So armed with this information from the LHC, together with some colleagues here at CERN, we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra-dense Higgs state, and we found a very intriguing result. Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special. It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse. So according to these calculations, we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff. And eventually, the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself.So is this how humanity is going to disappear? I don't think so. Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years, and this is a very long time. It's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.(Laughter)Even so, we will be long gone by then. In about five billion years, our sun will become a red giant, as large as the Earth's orbit, and our Earth will be kaput, and in a thousand billion years, if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate, you will not even be able to see as far as your toes, because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light. So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question, why is the Higgs boson mass so special? Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition? Theoretical physicists always ask \"why\" questions. More than how a phenomenon works, theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works. We think that this these \"why\" questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature. And indeed, a possible answer to my question opens up new universes, literally. It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles, and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws. And in this context, you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass. Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse. It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees. And the reason is simple: because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall. As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value, near to collapse. And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse. In the majority of bubble universes, the Higgs mass could be around the critical value, near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field, because of two competing effects, just as in the case of sand.My story does not have an end, because we still don't know the end of the story. This is science in progress, and to solve the mystery, we need more data, and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues to this story. Just one number, the Higgs boson mass, and yet, out of this number we learn so much. I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles are all there is in the universe, even beyond the domain explored so far. From this, we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space-time may be standing on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse, and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach, the multiverse.But I don't know if my hypothesis is right. That's how physics works: A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley. But whichever it turns out to be, there is one thing I'm sure of: The journey will be full of surprises.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1853, "subtitle":

Collider\n\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.270\ndiscovered the Higgs boson.\n\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.238\nIt was a historical day.\n\n00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:24.533\nThere's no doubt that from now on,\n\n00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.367\nthe Fourth of July will be remembered\n\n00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:28.809\nnot as the day of the Declaration of Independence,\n\n00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.643\nbut as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.\n\n00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:35.075\nWell, at least, here at CERN.\n\n00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:39.230\nBut for me, the biggest surprise of that day\n\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.729\nwas that there was no big surprise.\n\n00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.328\nIn the eye of a theoretical physicist,\n\n00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:46.221\nthe Higgs boson is a clever explanation\n\n00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.744\nof how some elementary particles gain mass,\n\n00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.580\nbut it seems a fairly unsatisfactory\n\n00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.786\nand incomplete solution.\n\n00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.810\nToo many questions are left unanswered.\n\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.645\nThe Higgs boson does not share the beauty,\n\n00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.530\nthe symmetry, the elegance,\n\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.258\nof the rest of the elementary particle world.\n\n00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:08.880\nFor this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists\n\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.822\nbelieve that the Higgs boson could not\n\n00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:14.304\nbe the full story.\n\n00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:17.158\nWe were expecting new particles and new phenomena\n\n00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:19.608\naccompanying the Higgs boson.\n\n00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:21.926\nInstead, so far, the measurements\n\n00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:25.684\ncoming from the LHC show no signs of new particles\n\n00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.833\nor unexpected phenomena.\n\n00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:31.486\nOf course, the verdict is not definitive.\n\n00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:35.480\nIn 2015, the LHC will almost double\n\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.171\nthe energy of the colliding protons,\n\n00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.242\nand these more powerful collisions\n\n00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:44.826\nwill allow us to explore further the particle world,\n\n00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:47.958\nand we will certainly learn much more.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.104\nBut for the moment, since we have found\n\n00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:54.253\nno evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose\n\n00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:57.417\nthat the particles that we know today,\n\n00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.273\nincluding the Higgs boson,\n\n00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:02.558\nare the only elementary particles in nature,\n\n00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.302\neven at energies much larger\n\n00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:08.068\nthan what we have explored so far.\n\n00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:12.700\nLet's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.\n\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.132\nWe will find a surprising and intriguing result\n\n00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:19.931\nabout our universe, and to explain my point,\n\n00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.807\nlet me first tell you what the Higgs is about,\n\n00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.941\nand to do so, we have to go back\n\n00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.298\nto one tenth of a billionth of a second\n\n00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:32.829\nafter the Big Bang.\n\n00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.870\nAnd according to the Higgs theory,\n\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.236\nat that instant, a dramatic event took place\n\n00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:39.827\nin the universe.\n\n00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:44.618\nSpace-time underwent a phase transition.\n\n00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.695\nIt was something very similar to the phase transition\n\n00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:51.240\nthat occurs when water turns into ice\n\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.201\nbelow zero degrees.\n\n00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.141\nBut in our case, the phase transition\n\n00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.672\nis not a change in the way the molecules\n\n00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:00.958\nare arranged inside the material,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.846\nbut is about a change\n\n00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:06.472\nof the very fabric of space-time.\n\n00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:09.098\nDuring this phase transition, empty space\n\n00:03:09.098 --> 00:03:11.770\nbecame filled with a substance\n\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.802\nthat we now call Higgs field.\n\n00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:17.131\nAnd this substance may seem invisible to us,\n\n00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:19.809\nbut it has a physical reality.\n\n00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.867\nIt surrounds us all the time,\n\n00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:25.568\njust like the air we breathe in this room.\n\n00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.886\nAnd some elementary particles interact\n\n00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:31.714\nwith this substance, gaining energy in the process.\n\n00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:34.789\nAnd this intrinsic energy is what we call\n\n00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.922\nthe mass of a particle,\n\n00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:40.175\nand by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC\n\n00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:44.707\nhas conclusively proved that this substance is real,\n\n00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:48.626\nbecause it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.\n\n00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:52.070\nAnd this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.\n\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.813\nBut this story is far more interesting than that.\n\n00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:59.124\nBy studying the Higgs theory,\n\n00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:01.484\ntheoretical physicists discovered,\n\n00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:03.388\nnot through an experiment\n\n00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.864\nbut with the power of mathematics,\n\n00:04:05.864 --> 00:04:09.576\nthat the Higgs field does not necessarily exist\n\n00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:12.913\nonly in the form that we observe today.\n\n00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:17.958\nJust like matter can exist as liquid or solid,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.530\nso the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,\n\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.884\ncould exist in two states.\n\n00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:28.194\nBesides the known Higgs state,\n\n00:04:28.194 --> 00:04:31.341\nthere could be a second state in which the Higgs field\n\n00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:34.877\nis billions and billions times denser\n\n00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:36.922\nthan what we observe today,\n\n00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:40.409\nand the mere existence of another state\n\n00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.654\nof the Higgs field poses a potential problem.\n\n00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:47.892\nThis is because, according to the laws\n\n00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:50.585\nof quantum mechanics, it is possible\n\n00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:53.417\nto have transitions between two states,\n\n00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:56.366\neven in the presence of an energy barrier\n\n00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:58.994\nseparating the two states,\n\n00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.203\nand the phenomenon is called,\n\n00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:05.345\nquite appropriately, quantum tunneling.\n\n00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.236\nBecause of quantum tunneling,\n\n00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:09.769\nI could disappear from this room\n\n00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:13.091\nand reappear in the next room,\n\n00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.486\npractically penetrating the wall.\n\n00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:19.301\nBut don't expect me to actually perform the trick\n\n00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:21.879\nin front of your eyes, because the probability\n\n00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.267\nfor me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.\n\n00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:28.865\nYou would have to wait a really long time\n\n00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:30.997\nbefore it happens, but believe me,\n\n00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.174\nquantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,\n\n00:05:34.174 --> 00:05:37.369\nand it has been observed in many systems.\n\n00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.931\nFor instance, the tunnel diode,\n\n00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.128\na component used in electronics,\n\n00:05:42.128 --> 00:05:44.550\nworks thanks to the wonders\n\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.870\nof quantum tunneling.\n\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.162\nBut let's go back to the Higgs field.\n\n00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:53.725\nIf the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,\n\n00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:56.079\nthen, because of quantum tunneling,\n\n00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.792\na bubble of this state could suddenly appear\n\n00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:03.034\nin a certain place of the universe at a certain time,\n\n00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:06.799\nand it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.\n\n00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.888\nBubbles of vapor form inside the water,\n\n00:06:09.888 --> 00:06:13.744\nthen they expand, turning liquid into gas.\n\n00:06:13.744 --> 00:06:18.548\nIn the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state\n\n00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:21.975\ncould come into existence because of quantum tunneling.\n\n00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:24.812\nThe bubble would then expand at the speed of light,\n\n00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:28.298\ninvading all space, and turning the Higgs field\n\n00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:31.947\nfrom the familiar state into a new state.\n\n00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:36.108\nIs this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.\n\n00:06:36.108 --> 00:06:38.853\nWe may not realize it in ordinary life,\n\n00:06:38.853 --> 00:06:42.058\nbut the intensity of the Higgs field is critical\n\n00:06:42.058 --> 00:06:44.703\nfor the structure of matter.\n\n00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:48.776\nIf the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,\n\n00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.720\nwe would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying\n\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.406\ninside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,\n\n00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:57.746\nand hydrogen would be\n\n00:06:57.746 --> 00:07:02.098\nthe only possible chemical element in the universe.\n\n00:07:02.098 --> 00:07:05.109\nAnd the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,\n\n00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:08.923\nis not just a few times more intense than today,\n\n00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:11.118\nbut billions of times,\n\n00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:14.320\nand if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,\n\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.473\nall atomic matter would collapse.\n\n00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:21.963\nNo molecular structures would be possible, no life.\n\n00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:25.301\nSo, I wonder, is it possible\n\n00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:27.887\nthat in the future, the Higgs field\n\n00:07:27.887 --> 00:07:30.452\nwill undergo a phase transition and,\n\n00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:33.581\nthrough quantum tunneling, will be transformed\n\n00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:38.268\ninto this nasty, ultra-dense state?\n\n00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:41.793\nIn other words, I ask myself, what is the fate\n\n00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:44.876\nof the Higgs field in our universe?\n\n00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:47.127\nAnd the crucial ingredient necessary\n\n00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.513\nto answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.\n\n00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:55.624\nAnd experiments at the LHC found that the mass\n\n00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:59.898\nof the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.\n\n00:07:59.898 --> 00:08:02.934\nThis is tiny when expressed in familiar units,\n\n00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:04.254\nbecause it's equal to something like\n\n00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:06.461\n10 to the minus 22 grams,\n\n00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:10.431\nbut it is large in particle physics units,\n\n00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.535\nbecause it is equal to the weight\n\n00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:14.781\nof an entire molecule\n\n00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:17.201\nof a DNA constituent.\n\n00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.588\nSo armed with this information from the LHC,\n\n00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:22.532\ntogether with some colleagues here at CERN,\n\n00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.441\nwe computed the probability\n\n00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.456\nthat our universe could quantum tunnel\n\n00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:30.574\ninto the ultra-dense Higgs state,\n\n00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:34.251\nand we found a very intriguing result.\n\n00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.400\nOur calculations showed\n\n00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.572\nthat the measured value of the Higgs boson mass\n\n00:08:39.572 --> 00:08:41.417\nis very special.\n\n00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:44.336\nIt has just the right value\n\n00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:47.029\nto keep the universe hanging\n\n00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:49.599\nin an unstable situation.\n\n00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.855\nThe Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration\n\n00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:54.904\nthat has lasted so far\n\n00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:57.949\nbut that will eventually collapse.\n\n00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:01.128\nSo according to these calculations,\n\n00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:03.158\nwe are like campers\n\n00:09:03.158 --> 00:09:05.610\nwho accidentally set their tent\n\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.404\nat the edge of a cliff.\n\n00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:09.194\nAnd eventually, the Higgs field\n\n00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:11.130\nwill undergo a phase transition\n\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.174\nand matter will collapse into itself.\n\n00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:17.618\nSo is this how humanity is going to disappear?\n\n00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:19.373\nI don't think so.\n\n00:09:19.373 --> 00:09:22.726\nOur calculation shows that quantum tunneling\n\n00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:26.382\nof the Higgs field is not likely to occur\n\n00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:29.886\nin the next 10 to the 100 years,\n\n00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:32.928\nand this is a very long time.\n\n00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:34.696\nIt's even longer than\n\n00:09:34.696 --> 00:09:38.365\nthe time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.\n\n00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:40.772\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.772 --> 00:09:44.563\nEven so, we will be long gone by then.\n\n00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:47.171\nIn about five billion years,\n\n00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:49.628\nour sun will become a red giant,\n\n00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:52.141\nas large as the Earth's orbit,\n\n00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:55.418\nand our Earth will be kaput,\n\n00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:57.775\nand in a thousand billion years,\n\n00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:00.061\nif dark energy keeps on fueling\n\n00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.896\nspace expansion at the present rate,\n\n00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:07.073\nyou will not even be able to see as far as your toes,\n\n00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.770\nbecause everything around you\n\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.471\nexpands at a rate faster than the speed of light.\n\n00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:14.456\nSo it is really unlikely\n\n00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:18.326\nthat we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.\n\n00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.905\nBut the reason why I am interested\n\n00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:23.917\nin the transition of the Higgs field\n\n00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:27.202\nis because I want to address the question,\n\n00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:32.167\nwhy is the Higgs boson mass so special?\n\n00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:35.141\nWhy is it just right to keep the universe\n\n00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:38.631\nat the edge of a phase transition?\n\n00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:42.493\nTheoretical physicists always ask \"why\" questions.\n\n00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:45.168\nMore than how a phenomenon works,\n\n00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:47.640\ntheoretical physicists are always interested in\n\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.872\nwhy a phenomenon works in the way it works.\n\n00:10:50.872 --> 00:10:54.234\nWe think that this these \"why\" questions\n\n00:10:54.234 --> 00:10:55.957\ncan give us clues\n\n00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:59.495\nabout the fundamental principles of nature.\n\n00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:03.400\nAnd indeed, a possible answer to my question\n\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.764\nopens up new universes, literally.\n\n00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:11.205\nIt has been speculated that our universe\n\n00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:15.338\nis only a bubble in a soapy multiverse\n\n00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:17.901\nmade out of a multitude of bubbles,\n\n00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:20.117\nand each bubble is a different universe\n\n00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:22.011\nwith different fundamental constants\n\n00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:23.876\nand different physical laws.\n\n00:11:23.876 --> 00:11:25.882\nAnd in this context, you can only talk about\n\n00:11:25.882 --> 00:11:30.593\nthe probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.\n\n00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:32.936\nThen the key to the mystery\n\n00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:36.199\ncould lie in the statistical properties\n\n00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:38.427\nof the multiverse.\n\n00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:40.841\nIt would be something like what happens\n\n00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:43.078\nwith sand dunes on a beach.\n\n00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.950\nIn principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes\n\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.380\nof any slope angle in a beach,\n\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.541\nand yet, the slope angles of sand dunes\n\n00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:56.011\nare typically around 30, 35 degrees.\n\n00:11:56.011 --> 00:11:57.679\nAnd the reason is simple:\n\n00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:01.357\nbecause wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.\n\n00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:04.241\nAs a result, the vast majority of sand dunes\n\n00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:08.160\nhave slope angles around the critical value,\n\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.144\nnear to collapse.\n\n00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:13.141\nAnd something similar could happen\n\n00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:17.678\nfor the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.\n\n00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:20.550\nIn the majority of bubble universes,\n\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.607\nthe Higgs mass could be around the critical value,\n\n00:12:23.607 --> 00:12:27.203\nnear to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,\n\n00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:29.150\nbecause of two competing effects,\n\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.736\njust as in the case of sand.\n\n00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:35.881\nMy story does not have an end,\n\n00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:39.616\nbecause we still don't know the end of the story.\n\n00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:42.904\nThis is science in progress,\n\n00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:46.738\nand to solve the mystery, we need more data,\n\n00:12:46.738 --> 00:12:51.354\nand hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues\n\n00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.975\nto this story.\n\n00:12:53.975 --> 00:12:57.805\nJust one number, the Higgs boson mass,\n\n00:12:57.805 --> 00:13:03.134\nand yet, out of this number we learn so much.\n\n00:13:03.134 --> 00:13:06.181\nI started from a hypothesis, that the known particles\n\n00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:08.217\nare all there is in the universe,\n\n00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:10.923\neven beyond the domain explored so far.\n\n00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:14.691\nFrom this, we discovered that the Higgs field\n\n00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:18.134\nthat permeates space-time may be standing\n\n00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:22.691\non a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,\n\n00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:26.241\nand we discovered that this may be a hint\n\n00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:30.274\nthat our universe is only a grain of sand\n\n00:13:30.274 --> 00:13:33.887\nin a giant beach, the multiverse.\n\n00:13:33.887 --> 00:13:37.138\nBut I don't know if my hypothesis is right.\n\n00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:40.821\nThat's how physics works: A single measurement\n\n00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:43.685\ncan put us on the road to a new understanding\n\n00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:45.348\nof the universe\n\n00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:48.367\nor it can send us down a blind alley.\n\n00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:50.931\nBut whichever it turns out to be,\n\n00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:54.123\nthere is one thing I'm sure of:\n\n00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:57.472\nThe journey will be full of surprises.\n\n00:13:57.472 --> 00:13:58.845\nThank you.\n\n00:13:58.845 -->

"My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions.Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this. Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design. At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away.(Laughter)After seeing a few of these buildings \u2014 there are many in the city \u2014 we realized that they have three very big points. First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling. In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia. It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.Also during our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vendors. And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall. But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles.The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there. And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building. And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.I also thought, how to close the building? And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way. And then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses. That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night.With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, \"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.\" But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project.And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. And these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines. When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern.And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan. And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment? And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor. The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another.These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process. And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. For this reason, I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1854, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.012\nMy work focuses on the

textile\n\n00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:06.562\nlike a shell made of concrete\n\n00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:10.133\nwith perforations that would let the air in,\n\n00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.757\nand also the light, but in a filtered way.\n\n00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:18.561\nAnd then the inspiration came from these beautiful \npatterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.\n\n00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:20.736\nThat they have fractal geometry properties\n\n00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.867\nand this helped me to shape the whole facade.\n\n00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:24.472\nAnd we are building that\n\n00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:26.613\nwith these small prefabricated pieces\n\n00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:30.051\nthat are the windows that let the air and the light\n\n00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:32.033\nin a controlled way inside the building.\n\n00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:34.415\nAnd this is complemented by these small colored glasses\n\n00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:37.018\nthat use the light from the inside of the building\n\n00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:39.904\nto light up the building at night.\n\n00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:44.026\nWith these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers\n\n00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:45.182\nbecause they were like,\n\n00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:47.870\n\"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.\"\n\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.679\nBut then we all realized that this idea of the market\n\n00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.453\nhappened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall\n\n00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.173\nbecause basically they had more shops to sell.\n\n00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:03.247\nAnd also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,\n\n00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:05.475\nnot only because of the material compared with the glass,\n\n00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.163\nbut also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.\n\n00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.320\nSo we created some budget savings\n\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.217\nthat we used to implement the project.\n\n00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.149\nAnd the first implementation was to think\n\n00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.389\nabout how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy\n\n00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.723\nin a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.\n\n00:04:20.723 --> 00:04:24.940\nSo we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.\n\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.021\nAnd then under those panels\n\n00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:30.757\nwe thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars\n\n00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.571\nthat would create this urban oasis.\n\n00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.361\nAnd these porches on the roof,\n\n00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:40.097\nall together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.\n\n00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:45.259\nHopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.\n\n00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.314\nThe second example is a master plan\n\n00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:51.593\nof 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.\n\n00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:55.527\nAnd for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,\n\n00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.792\nI really needed to understand the city of Tunis,\n\n00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:01.914\nbut also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.\n\n00:05:01.914 --> 00:05:05.022\nDuring that analysis I paid special attention to the medina\n\n00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:08.999\nthat is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,\n\n00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.448\nopened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.\n\n00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:17.817\nWhen I went to the site, the first design operation we did\n\n00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.837\nwas to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks\n\n00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:25.021\nsimilar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona\n\n00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:28.012\nand other cities in Europe with these courtyards.\n\n00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:30.797\nOn top of that, we selected some strategic points\n\n00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.998\nreminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,\n\n00:05:33.998 --> 00:05:36.768\nand this modified this initial pattern.\n\n00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:39.218\nAnd the last operation was to think about the cell,\n\n00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:41.908\nthe small cell of the project, like the apartment,\n\n00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.686\nas an essential part of the master plan.\n\n00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:46.859\nAnd for that I thought, what would be the best orientation\n\n00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:49.158\nin the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?\n\n00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:53.921\nAnd it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house\n\n00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.784\nand then a natural ventilation.\n\n00:05:56.784 --> 00:06:00.370\nSo we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments\n\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.510\nare perfectly oriented in that direction.\n\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.970\nAnd this is the result\n\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.735\nthat is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.\n\n00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.333\nIt has these blocks with courtyards,\n\n00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:10.456\nand then on the ground floor\n\n00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:12.592\nyou have all these connections for the pedestrians.\n\n00:06:12.592 --> 00:06:15.699\nAnd also it responds to the local regulations that establish\n\n00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.362\na higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.\n\n00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:22.908\nAnd it also reinforces this idea of the gates.\n\n00:06:22.908 --> 00:06:24.800\nThe volume has this connecting shape\n\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.102\nthat shades itself with three different types of apartments\n\n00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:31.745\nand also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood\n\n00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.645\nAnd in the courtyards there are the different facilities,\n\n00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:36.375\nsuch as a gym and a kindergarten\n\n00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:40.445\nand close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.\n\n00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:43.245\nThe roof, which is my favorite space of the project\n\n00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:46.955\nis almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.\n\n00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:49.239\nAnd it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,\n\n00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:52.776\nand do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,\n\n00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:56.160\njumping from one building to another.\n\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.519\nThese two examples,\n\n00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.903\nthey have a common approach in the design process.\n\n00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:04.482\nAnd also, they are in emerging countries where you can see\n\n00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:06.628\nthe cities literally growing.\n\n00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:11.369\nIn these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow\n\n00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.510\nchanges the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.\n\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.118\nFor this reason, I see even more importance\n\n00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:24.148\nto look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions\n\n00:07:24.148 --> 00:07:28.209\nthat enhance the relationship between the community and the environment\n\n00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:32.127\nand that aim to connect nature and people.\n\n00:07:32.127 --> 00:07:34.025\nThank you very much.\n\n00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:35.852\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Government -- investor, risk-taker, innovator", "duration": "844", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mariana_mazzucato_government_investor_risk_taker_innovator", "transcript": "Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies, the really cool companies, the innovative ones, the creative, new economy-type companies \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 are coming out of one particular country, the United States of America? Usually when I say this, someone says, \"Spotify! That's Europe.\" But, yeah. It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles? What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model, which they understand is different from this old economy growth model? And what is interesting is that often, even if we're in the 21st century, we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state. It's talked about in these modern ways, but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley, the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms, the private initiative, whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies, the gazelles as we often call them, which traditional banks are scared of, or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions, their products, to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail.But what really interests me, especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world, is the language that's used, the narrative, the discourse, the images, the actual words. So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box. They are more dynamic. Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford, where he said to be innovative, you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish. Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys, right? And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector. It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could. And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan. Right? This monster with big tentacles. They're very explicit in these editorials. They say, \"You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet? We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen,\" they say \u2014 this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution \u2014 they say, \"the state, just stick to the basics, right? Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools. Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what? Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.\" Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers. They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth. And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers. It has huge implications, even with this whole notion that we have on where, when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which, of course, as we know, are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition. Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something. So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy.And so to think again, there's no reason that you should believe me, so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone. Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone. What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone? So the Internet, which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world; GPS, where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world; the touchscreen display, which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody. These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded. And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense. GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program. Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA. The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware. Now, you might be thinking, \"Well, she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,\" but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department. So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth, is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits, because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental. So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs \u2014 Viagra, different color, different dosage \u2014 are the less revolutionary ones. And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs. This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation. They do. They spend on the marketing part. They spend on the D part of R&D. They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock, which is quite problematic. In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R&D, but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about.Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures. It was actually shaping and creating markets. It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research. It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist. So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important. Why? Because, as many of us know, V.C. is actually quite short-term. They want their returns in three to five years. Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years. And so this whole notion \u2014 I mean, this is the point, right? Who's actually funding the hard stuff? Of course, it's not just the state. The private sector does a lot. But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box. In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state. The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology, came from within government.And so there's huge implications of this. First of all, of course I'm not someone, this old-fashioned person, market versus state. What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships. But the point is, by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually \u2014 pffff \u2014 a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan, I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way. Even the words that we often use to justify the \"P\" part, the public part \u2014 well, they're both P's \u2014 with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking. What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking. It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on. It's actually been the one thinking out of the box. But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, \"You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him.\" That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there. Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy. By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way. So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations. DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri, actually thought really hard about this, how to welcome failure, because you will fail. You will fail when you innovative. One out of 10 experiments has any success. And the V.C. guys know this, and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success.And this brings me, actually, probably, to the biggest implication, and this has huge implications beyond innovation. If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward? We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course, the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship, and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait, to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds, that whole risk-reward thing. Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet? The Internet was crazy. It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive. You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were. Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker. And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax. You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. Well, unfortunately, that's not true. Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad. Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic. Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps. I mean, one can take a position on that. But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state \u2014 Apple's a great example. They even got the first \u2014 well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone. And yet we know they legally, as many other companies, pay very little tax back.So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not? It could happen perhaps through equity. This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments. Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money, it's a public funding agency in Finland, which then funded the next round of Nokias. The Brazilian Development Bank, which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology, they just announced a $56 billion program for the future on this, is retaining equity in these investments. So to put it provocatively, had the U.S. government thought about this, and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund, you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund, there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology. Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained. But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent. If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right? Who are the different players in creating value in the economy, and is the state's role, has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player? If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth, because they have not.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1855, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.075\nHave you ever asked yourselves why it is that\n\n00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.155\ncompanies, the really cool companies,\n\n00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.667\nthe innovative ones, the creative,\n\n00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.469\nnew economy-type companies --\n\n00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.843\nApple, Google, Facebook --\n\n00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:26.531\nare coming out of one particular country,\n\n00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:28.262\nthe United States of America?\n\n00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.220\nUsually when I say this, someone says, \"Spotify!\n\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.698\nThat's Europe.\" But, yeah.\n\n00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.382\nIt has not had the impact that these other companies have had.\n\n00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:37.350\nNow what I do is I'm an economist,\n\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.838\nand I actually study the relationship\n\n00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.883\nbetween innovation and economic growth\n\n00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:43.782\nat the level of the company, the industry and the nation,\n\n00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.897\nand I work with policymakers worldwide,\n\n00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:47.368\nespecially in the European Commission,\n\n00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.679\nbut recently also in interesting places like China,\n\n00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.554\nand I can tell you that that question\n\n00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.154\nis on the tip of all of their tongues:\n\n00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.373\nWhere are the European Googles?\n\n00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:01.118\nWhat is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,\n\n00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:03.126\nwhich they understand is different\n\n00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:06.007\nfrom this old economy growth model?\n\n00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.686\nAnd what is interesting is that often,\n\n00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:10.265\neven if we're in the 21st century,\n\n00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.648\nwe kind of come down in the end to these ideas\n\n00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:14.621\nof market versus state.\n\n00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:16.673\nIt's talked about in these modern ways,\n\n00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:20.436\nbut the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,\n\n00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:24.222\nthe secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,\n\n00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:27.494\nthe private initiative, whether this be about\n\n00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.708\na dynamic venture capital sector\n\n00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.054\nthat's actually able to provide that high-risk finance\n\n00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:33.727\nto these innovative companies,\n\n00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.852\nthe gazelles as we often call them,\n\n00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:37.847\nwhich traditional banks are scared of,\n\n00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.879\nor different types of really successful\n\n00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.885\ncommercialization policies which actually allow these companies\n\n00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:45.140\nto bring these great inventions, their products,\n\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.163\nto the market and actually get over this\n\n00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:49.414\nreally scary Death Valley period\n\n00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:51.980\nin which many companies instead fail.\n\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.756\nBut what really interests me, especially nowadays\n\n00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.717\nand because of what's happening politically around the world,\n\n00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.970\nis the language that's used, the narrative,\n\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.129\nthe discourse, the images, the actual words.\n\n00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.434\nSo we often are presented\n\n00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:09.407\nwith the kind of words like that the private sector\n\n00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:11.677\nis also much more innovative because it's able to\n\n00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:13.277\nthink out of the box.\n\n00:02:13.277 --> 00:02:15.530\nThey are more dynamic.\n\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.284\nThink of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech\n\n00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:21.422\nto the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,\n\n00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:23.514\nwhere he said to be innovative,\n\n00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:26.284\nyou've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.\n\n00:02:26.284 --> 00:02:27.819\nRight?

Because, as many of us know,\n\n00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:40.694\nV.C. is actually quite short-term.\n\n00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:42.483\nThey want their returns in three to five years.\n\n00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:45.012\nInnovation takes a much longer time than that,\n\n00:07:45.012 --> 00:07:46.839\n15 to 20 years.\n\n00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.226\nAnd so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?\n\n00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:51.553\nWho's actually funding the hard stuff?\n\n00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:53.278\nOf course, it's not just the state.\n\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:54.508\nThe private sector does a lot.\n\n00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.707\nBut the narrative that we've always been told\n\n00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:59.590\nis the state is important for the basics,\n\n00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.870\nbut not really providing that sort of high-risk,\n\n00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.170\nrevolutionary thinking out of the box.\n\n00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.502\nIn all these sectors, from funding the Internet\n\n00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:09.407\nto doing the spending, but also the envisioning,\n\n00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:11.698\nthe strategic vision, for these investments,\n\n00:08:11.698 --> 00:08:13.286\nit was actually coming within the state.\n\n00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:15.655\nThe nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating\n\n00:08:15.655 --> 00:08:18.753\nto study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,\n\n00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:20.724\ncame from within government.\n\n00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:23.071\nAnd so there's huge implications of this.\n\n00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:25.176\nFirst of all, of course I'm not someone,\n\n00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.178\nthis old-fashioned person, market versus state.\n\n00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:29.703\nWhat we all know in dynamic capitalism\n\n00:08:29.703 --> 00:08:32.762\nis that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.\n\n00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.501\nBut the point is, by constantly depicting\n\n00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:37.626\nthe state part as necessary\n\n00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:40.507\nbut actually -- pffff -- a bit boring\n\n00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:43.556\nand often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,\n\n00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.308\nI think we've actually really stunted the possibility\n\n00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.880\nto build these public-private partnerships\n\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.426\nin a really dynamic way.\n\n00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:52.620\nEven the words that we often use to justify the \"P\" part,\n\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.848\nthe public part -- well, they're both P's --\n\n00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:56.208\nwith public-private partnerships\n\n00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:58.263\nis in terms of de-risking.\n\n00:08:58.263 --> 00:09:00.724\nWhat the public sector did in all these examples\n\n00:09:00.724 --> 00:09:02.811\nI just gave you, and there's many more,\n\n00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:06.275\nwhich myself and other colleagues have been looking at,\n\n00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:07.825\nis doing much more than de-risking.\n\n00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.391\nIt's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.\n\n00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:12.964\nIt's actually been the one thinking out of the box.\n\n00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:15.675\nBut also, I'm sure you all have had experience\n\n00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:17.735\nwith local, regional, national governments,\n\n00:09:17.735 --> 00:09:20.882\nand you're kind of like, \"You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him.\"\n\n00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:24.326\nThat whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.\n\n00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:26.140\nWell, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.306\nBy talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,\n\n00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:30.633\nboring, it's sometimes\n\n00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.845\nthat we actually create those organizations in that way.\n\n00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:35.046\nSo what we have to actually do is build\n\n00:09:35.046 --> 00:09:37.222\nthese entrepreneurial state organizations.\n\n00:09:37.222 --> 00:09:39.711\nDARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,\n\n00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:41.296\nactually thought really hard about this,\n\n00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:43.989\nhow to welcome failure, because you will fail.\n\n00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:45.914\nYou will fail when you innovative.\n\n00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:49.786\nOne out of 10 experiments has any success.\n\n00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:51.524\nAnd the V.C. guys know this,\n\n00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.396\nand they're able to actually fund the other losses\n\n00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:55.250\nfrom that one success.\n\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.743\nAnd this brings me, actually, probably,\n\n00:09:56.743 --> 00:09:59.338\nto the biggest implication,\n\n00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:02.005\nand this has huge implications beyond innovation.\n\n00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:05.665\nIf the state is more than just a market fixer,\n\n00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:07.477\nif it actually is a market shaper,\n\n00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:10.445\nand in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,\n\n00:10:10.445 --> 00:10:12.439\nwhat happened to the reward?\n\n00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:14.813\nWe all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,\n\n00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:18.219\nthe first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,\n\n00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:19.839\nand so some people are foolish enough\n\n00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.301\nor probably smart enough if they have time to wait,\n\n00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:24.783\nto actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk\n\n00:10:24.783 --> 00:10:27.303\nwhich over time will make a greater reward than bonds,\n\n00:10:27.303 --> 00:10:28.882\nthat whole risk-reward thing.\n\n00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:30.855\nWell, where's the reward for the state\n\n00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:33.311\nof having taken on these massive risks\n\n00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.770\nand actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?\n\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.722\nThe Internet was crazy.\n\n00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:40.874\nIt really was.

It's tax.\n\n00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:58.550\nYou know, the companies will pay tax,\n\n00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.840\nthe jobs they create will create growth\n\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.991\nso people who get those jobs and their incomes rise\n\n00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.215\nwill come back to the state through the tax mechanism.\n\n00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.205\nWell, unfortunately, that's not true.\n\n00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:12.724\nOkay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.\n\n00:11:12.724 --> 00:11:15.691\nGlobalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.\n\n00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.898\nLet the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.\n\n00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.987\nI mean, one can take a position on that.\n\n00:11:19.987 --> 00:11:21.651\nBut also these companies\n\n00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:24.723\nthat have actually had this massive benefit from the state --\n\n00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:26.584\nApple's a great example.\n\n00:11:26.584 --> 00:11:28.633\nThey even got the first -- well, not the first,\n\n00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:33.201\nbut 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,\n\n00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:35.870\nthrough this SBIC program,\n\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.918\nwhich predated the SBIR program,\n\n00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:41.236\nas well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.\n\n00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:43.726\nAnd yet we know they legally,\n\n00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:47.408\nas many other companies, pay very little tax back.\n\n00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:50.395\nSo what we really need to actually rethink\n\n00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:54.654\nis should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism\n\n00:11:54.654 --> 00:11:57.341\nthat's much more direct than tax. Why not?\n\n00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.911\nIt could happen perhaps through equity.\n\n00:11:59.911 --> 00:12:01.718\nThis, by the way, in the countries\n\n00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:04.022\nthat are actually thinking about this strategically,\n\n00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:06.153\ncountries like Finland in Scandinavia,\n\n00:12:06.153 --> 00:12:08.188\nbut also in China and Brazil,\n\n00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:10.518\nthey're retaining equity in these investments.\n\n00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:14.344\nSitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,\n\n00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:17.004\nit's a public funding agency in Finland,\n\n00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:19.830\nwhich then funded the next round of Nokias.\n\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.839\nThe Brazilian Development Bank,\n\n00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.634\nwhich is providing huge amounts of funds today\n\n00:12:24.634 --> 00:12:26.431\nto clean technology, they just announced\n\n00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:30.680\na $56 billion program for the future on this,\n\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.219\nis retaining equity in these investments.\n\n00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:35.731\nSo to put it provocatively,\n\n00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:38.670\nhad the U.S. government thought about this,\n\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.514\nand maybe just brought back\n\n00:12:40.514 --> 00:12:42.939\njust something called an innovation fund,\n\n00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:46.071\nyou can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent\n\n00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:47.954\nof the profits from what the Internet produced\n\n00:12:47.954 --> 00:12:49.612\nhad come back to that innovation fund,\n\n00:12:49.612 --> 00:12:51.236\nthere would be so much more money\n\n00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:53.464\nto spend today on green technology.\n\n00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:54.958\nInstead, many of the state budgets\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.556\nwhich in theory are trying to do that\n\n00:12:57.556 --> 00:12:59.392\nare being constrained.\n\n00:12:59.392 --> 00:13:01.202\nBut perhaps even more important,\n\n00:13:01.202 --> 00:13:03.069\nwe heard before about the one percent,\n\n00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:04.644\nthe 99 percent.\n\n00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:08.389\nIf the state is thought about in this more strategic way,\n\n00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:11.422\nas one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,\n\n00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.243\nbecause that's what we're talking about, right?\n\n00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:15.177\nWho are the different players in creating value\n\n00:13:15.177 --> 00:13:17.472\nin the economy, and is the state's role,\n\n00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:21.201\nhas it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?\n\n00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:23.556\nIf we can actually have a broader theory\n\n00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:25.609\nof value creation and allow us to actually admit\n\n00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:28.660\nwhat the state has been doing and reap something back,\n\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.479\nit might just be that in the next round,\n\n00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:34.045\nand I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution\n\n00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:35.686\nwill in fact be green,\n\n00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:37.409\nthat that period of growth\n\n00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:40.099\nwill not only be smart, innovation-led,\n\n00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:43.285\nnot only green, but also more inclusive,\n\n00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:46.539\nso that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley\n\n00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:49.279\ncan actually also benefit from that growth,\n\n00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.878\nbecause they have not.\n\n00:13:50.878 --> 00:13:52.131\nThank you.\n\n00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:57.378\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis", "duration": "821", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mohamed_hijri_a_simple_solution_to_the_coming_phosphorus_crisis", "transcript": "I'm going to start by asking you a question: Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem? Okay, so most of you are. I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. Nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water, or swim in a blue algae-infested lake. Right?I hope you won't be disappointed, but today, I won't be talking about blue algae. Instead, I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue, which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis. Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today? For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it. And by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue.Now, the problem is that if I ask, why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae? The answer is that it comes from how we farm. We use fertilizers in our farming, chemical fertilizers. Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture? Basically, to help plants grow and to produce a better yield. The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent.Before going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology. So, what does a plant need in order to grow? A plant, quite simply, needs light, it needs CO2, but even more importantly, it needs nutrients, which it draws from the soil. Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements: phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium. So, the plant\u2019s roots will extract these resources.Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus. Why phosphorus in particular? Because it is the most problematic chemical element. By the end of my presentation, you will have seen what these problems are, and where we are today.Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life. This is a very important point. I\u2019d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is. Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules, in many of our molecules of life. Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus-based \u2014 phosphorylation, dephosphorylation. Cell membranes are phosphorus-based: These are called phospholipids. The energy in all living things, ATP, is phosphorus-based. And more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA, something everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image. DNA is our genetic heritage. It is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.Now, where do we find this phosphorus? As humans, where do we find it? As I explained earlier, plants extract phosphorus from the soil, through water. So, we humans get it from the things we eat: plants, vegetables, fruits, and also from eggs, meat and milk. It\u2019s true that some humans eat better than others. Some are happier than others. And now, looking at this picture, which speaks for itself, we see modern agriculture, which I also refer to as intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers. Without them, we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world's population. Speaking of humans, there are currently 7 billion of us on Earth. In less than 40 years, there will be 9 billion of us. And the question is a simple one: Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations?So, in order to understand these issues, where do we find our phosphorus? Let me explain. But first, let\u2019s just suppose that we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus. Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost. It goes into the soil, ending its journey in the lakes, resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus, which leads to the blue algae problem. So, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here, something that is illogical. A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used, but only 15 percent goes to the plant. You\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful. Yes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. Nobody wants to throw their money out the window, but unfortunately that's what is happening here. Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost. Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus. And because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant, all the rest is lost, we have to add more and more.Now, where will we get this phosphorus from? Basically, we get it out of mines. This is the cover of an extraordinary article published in Nature in 2009, which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis. Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life, which is becoming increasingly scarce, yet nobody is talking about it. And everyone agrees: Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis.What you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S., and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine, if you look in the top right-hand corner, the little crane you can see, that is a giant crane. So that really puts it into perspective. So, we get phosphorus from mines. And if I make a comparison with oil, there\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it, we talk about global warming, yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis. To come back to the oil problem, oil is something we can replace. We can use biofuels, or solar power, or hydropower, but phosphorus is an essential element, indispensable to life, and we can\u2019t replace it.What is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves? This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today. The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves. In 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak. By the end of this century, it will all be gone. The dotted line shows where we are today. As you can see, they meet in 2030, I\u2019ll be retired by then. But we are indeed heading for a major crisis, and I\u2019d like people to become aware of this problem.Do we have a solution? What are we to do? We are faced with a paradox. Less and less phosphorus will be available. By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us, and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today. So, we will have less phosphorus, but we'll need to produce more food. What should we do? It truly is a paradoxical situation. Do we have a solution, or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use?Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost. The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time, even before plants existed on Earth, and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious, very simple, and yet also extremely complex. I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now. It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research.This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots. By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza. You\u2019re looking at the root of wheat, one of the world\u2019s most important plants. Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself. It will go in search of phosphorus, but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it. Beyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective. It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus. Now, imagine this tiny, microscopic mushroom. It grows much faster, and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus. It can go beyond the root\u2019s one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus.I haven\u2019t invented anything at all; it's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years. And over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use, to make it available to the plant. What you\u2019re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root, and the mushroom with its very fine filaments. Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. It will proliferate between the root's cells, eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure, which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom. And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur. It\u2019s a win-win trade: I give you phosphorus, and you feed me. True symbiosis.Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier. And instead of using a 100 percent dose, I\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent. You\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent, most will benefit the plant, more than 90 percent. A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil. That's completely natural. What's more is that in certain cases, we don't even need to add phosphorus.If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier, 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil, and the plants are unable to access it. Even though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form. The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms. The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use. To further support my argument, here is a picture that speaks for itself. These are trials in a field of sorghum. On the left side, you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture, with a 100 percent phosphorus dose. On the other side, the dose was reduced to 50 percent, and just look at the yield. With only a half-dose, we achieved a better yield.This is to show you that this method works. And in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India, the dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases, there's no need to add any phosphorus at all, because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. This is an example of soy production in Canada. Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other. And here, where blue indicates a better yield, and yellow a weaker yield. The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. In other words, as I already said, I have invented nothing. Mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years, and it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify.So, this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests. Mycorrhiza exists, it works, it's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide. The problem is that people are not aware of it. People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem. We have a technology that works, and one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves.In conclusion, I am a scientist and a dreamer. I'm passionate about this topic. So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is, which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak, it would be that we use one label, \"Made with mycorrhiza,\" and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too.Thank you for your attention.(Applause)", "id": 1783, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.148 -->

vegetables, fruits,\n\n00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:38.360\nand also from eggs, meat and milk.\n\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.927\nIt\u2019s true that some humans\neat better than others.\n\n00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:43.903\nSome are happier than others.\n\n00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:48.744\nAnd now, looking at this picture,\nwhich speaks for itself,\n\n00:03:49.034 --> 00:03:50.850\nwe see modern agriculture,\n\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.406\nwhich I also refer to\nas intensive agriculture.\n\n00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:58.862\nIntensive agriculture is based\non the use of chemical fertilizers.\n\n00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:01.890\nWithout them,\nwe would not manage to produce enough\n\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.918\nto feed the world's population.\n\n00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:08.396\nSpeaking of humans, there are currently\n7 billion of us on Earth.\n\n00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:11.822\nIn less than 40 years,\nthere will be 9 billion of us.\n\n00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:15.212\nAnd the question is a simple one:\nDo we have enough phosphorus\n\n00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:18.082\nto feed our future generations?\n\n00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:23.174\nSo, in order to understand these issues,\nwhere do we find our phosphorus?\n\n00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:24.795\nLet me explain.\n\n00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:27.532\nBut first, let\u2019s just suppose\n\n00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:32.708\nthat we are using\n100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.\n\n00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:40.776\nOnly 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant.\nEighty-five percent is lost.\n\n00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:45.635\nIt goes into the soil,\nending its journey in the lakes,\n\n00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:49.631\nresulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,\nwhich leads to the blue algae problem.\n\n00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.369\nSo, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here,\nsomething that is illogical.\n\n00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:57.458\nA hundred percent of the phosphorus is used,\nbut only 15 percent goes to the plant.\n\n00:04:57.808 --> 00:04:59.742\nYou\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful.\n\n00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:04.359\nYes, it is. What is worse\nis that it is very expensive.\n\n00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:07.741\nNobody wants to throw their money\nout the window,\n\n00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.081\nbut unfortunately\nthat's what is happening here.\n\n00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:13.277\nEighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.\n\n00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:20.659\nModern agriculture\ndepends on phosphorus.\n\n00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.258\nAnd because in order to get 15 percent of it\nto the plant, all the rest is lost,\n\n00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.179\nwe have to add more and more.\n\n00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.553\nNow, where will we get\nthis phosphorus from?\n\n00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:34.427\nBasically, we get it out of mines.\n\n00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:37.194\nThis is the cover\nof an extraordinary article\n\n00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:39.231\npublished in Nature in 2009,\n\n00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:42.418\nwhich really launched the discussion\nabout the phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:47.381\nPhosphorus, a nutrient essential to life,\nwhich is becoming increasingly scarce,\n\n00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.204\nyet nobody is talking about it.\n\n00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:55.068\nAnd everyone agrees:\nPoliticians and scientists are in agreement\n\n00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:57.409\nthat we are headed\nfor a phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.857\nWhat you are seeing here\nis an open-pit mine in the U.S.,\n\n00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:03.958\nand to give you an idea\nof the dimensions of this mine,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.512\nif you look in the top right-hand corner,\nthe little crane you can see,\n\n00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:08.977\nthat is a giant crane.\n\n00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.361\nSo that really puts it into perspective.\n\n00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:14.559\nSo, we get phosphorus from mines.\n\n00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.007\nAnd if I make a comparison with oil,\n\n00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:21.138\nthere\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it,\nwe talk about global warming,\n\n00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:23.162\nyet we never mention\nthe phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:06:23.162 --> 00:06:26.994\nTo come back to the oil problem,\noil is something we can replace.\n\n00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:31.726\nWe can use biofuels, or solar power,\n\n00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:35.490\nor hydropower,\nbut phosphorus is an essential element,\n\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.214\nindispensable to life,\nand we can\u2019t replace it.\n\n00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:44.727\nWhat is the current state\nof the world's phosphorus reserves?\n\n00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:48.838\nThis graph gives you a rough idea\nof where we are today.\n\n00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:53.489\nThe black line represents predictions\nfor phosphorus reserves.\n\n00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:56.113\nIn 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak.\n\n00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:59.439\nBy the end of this century,\nit will all be gone.\n\n00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:03.504\nThe dotted line shows where we are today.\n\n00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:07.406\nAs you can see, they meet in 2030,\nI\u2019ll be retired by then.\n\n00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:12.185\nBut we are indeed heading\nfor a major crisis,\n\n00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:15.457\nand I\u2019d like people to become aware\nof this problem.\n\n00:07:16.047 --> 00:07:17.687\nDo we have a solution?\n\n00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:21.519\nWhat are we to do?\nWe are faced with a paradox.\n\n00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:24.796\nLess and less phosphorus\nwill be available.\n\n00:07:25.076 --> 00:07:28.272\nBy 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,\n\n00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:34.806\nand according to\nthe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,\n\n00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:39.799\nwe will need to produce twice as much food\nin 2050 than we do today.\n\n00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:43.569\nSo, we will have less phosphorus,\nbut we'll need to produce more food.\n\n00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:45.717\nWhat should we do?\n\n00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:48.247\nIt truly is a paradoxical situation.\n\n00:07:48.987 --> 00:07:51.735\nDo we have a solution,\nor an alternative\n\n00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:54.703\nwhich will allow us to optimize\nphosphorus use?\n\n00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:58.073\nRemember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.\n\n00:08:00.323 --> 00:08:07.627\nThe solution I'm offering today is one\nthat has existed for a very long time,\n\n00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:10.025\neven before plants existed on Earth,\n\n00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:13.843\nand it's a microscopic mushroom\nthat is very mysterious,\n\n00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:17.351\nvery simple,\nand yet also extremely complex.\n\n00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.579\nI've been fascinated by this little mushroom\nfor over 16 years now.\n\n00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:26.424\nIt has led me to further my research\n\n00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:29.794\nand to use it as a model\nfor my laboratory research.\n\n00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:33.248\nThis mushroom exists in symbiosis\nwith the roots.\n\n00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:38.895\nBy symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional\nand mutually beneficial association\n\n00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:41.923\nwhich is also called mycorrhiza.\n\n00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:47.100\nThis slide illustrates the elements\nof a mycorrhiza.\n\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.365\nYou\u2019re looking at the root of wheat,\n\n00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:52.709\none of the world\u2019s most important plants.\n\n00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:56.298\nNormally, a root will find phosphorus\nall by itself.\n\n00:08:56.298 --> 00:08:58.330\nIt will go in search of phosphorus,\n\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.572\nbut only within the one millimeter\nwhich surrounds it.\n\n00:09:02.002 --> 00:09:05.077\nBeyond one millimeter,\nthe root is ineffective.\n\n00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.402\nIt cannot go further\nin its search for phosphorus.\n\n00:09:07.402 --> 00:09:10.138\nNow, imagine this tiny,\nmicroscopic mushroom.\n\n00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:12.399\nIt grows much faster,\n\n00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.195\nand is much better designed\nto seek out phosphorus.\n\n00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:18.574\nIt can go beyond\nthe root\u2019s one-millimeter scope\n\n00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:20.661\nto seek out phosphorus.\n\n00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:22.717\nI haven\u2019t invented anything at all;\n\n00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:26.215\nit's a biotechnology that has existed\nfor 450 million years.\n\n00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:30.128\nAnd over time, this mushroom\nhas evolved and adapted to seek out\n\n00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:33.621\neven the tiniest trace of phosphorus,\nand to put it to use,\n\n00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:35.954\nto make it available to the plant.\n\n00:09:36.674 --> 00:09:40.607\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here,\nin the real world, is a carrot root,\n\n00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.878\nand the mushroom\nwith its very fine filaments.\n\n00:09:43.878 --> 00:09:46.285\nLooking closer,\nwe can see that this mushroom\n\n00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.372\nis very gentle in its penetration.\n\n00:09:48.372 --> 00:09:52.061\nIt will proliferate\nbetween the root's cells,\n\n00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:55.144\neventually penetrating a cell\n\n00:09:55.554 --> 00:10:00.238\nand starting to form\na typical arbuscular structure,\n\n00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:05.435\nwhich will considerably increase\nthe exchange interface\n\n00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:07.994\nbetween the plant and the mushroom.\n\n00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:11.439\nAnd it is through this structure\nthat mutual exchanges will occur.\n\n00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:13.075\nIt\u2019s a win-win trade:\n\n00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:15.640\nI give you phosphorus, and you feed me.\n\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.220\nTrue symbiosis.\n\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.328\nNow let's add a mycorrhiza plant\n\n00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:26.588\ninto the diagram I used earlier.\n\n00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:31.665\nAnd instead of using a 100 percent dose,\nI\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent.\n\n00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:36.639\nYou\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent,\nmost will benefit the plant,\n\n00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.195\nmore than 90 percent.\n\n00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:41.775\nA very small amount of phosphorus\nwill remain in the soil.\n\n00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.075\nThat's completely natural.\n\n00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:49.406\nWhat's more is that in certain cases,\nwe don't even need to add phosphorus.\n\n00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:51.818\nIf you recall the graphs\nI showed you earlier,\n\n00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:55.039\n85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,\n\n00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:58.284\nand the plants are unable to access it.\n\n00:10:58.284 --> 00:11:02.092\nEven though it is present in the soil,\nit is in insoluble form.\n\n00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:05.102\nThe plant is only able to seek out\nsoluble forms.\n\n00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:08.914\nThe mushroom is capable\nof dissolving this insoluble form\n\n00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:12.355\nand making it available\nfor the plant to use.\n\n00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:15.906\nTo further support my argument,\nhere is a picture that speaks for itself.\n\n00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:19.794\nThese are trials\nin a field of sorghum.\n\n00:11:19.794 --> 00:11:24.306\nOn the left side, you see the yield\nproduced using conventional agriculture,\n\n00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:26.888\nwith a 100 percent phosphorus dose.\n\n00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:30.261\nOn the other side,\nthe dose was reduced to 50 percent,\n\n00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:31.794\nand just look at the yield.\n\n00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:37.375\nWith only a half-dose,\nwe achieved a better yield.\n\n00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:42.205\nThis is to show you\nthat this method works.\n\n00:11:42.205 --> 00:11:46.774\nAnd in some cases, in Cuba,\nMexico and India,\n\n00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:50.061\nthe dose can be reduced to 25 percent,\nand in several other cases,\n\n00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:52.215\nthere's no need to add\nany phosphorus at all,\n\n00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:54.659\nbecause the mushrooms are so well adapted\n\n00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:57.395\nto finding phosphorus\nand drawing it from the soil.\n\n00:11:57.855 --> 00:12:02.373\nThis is an example of soy production\nin Canada.\n\n00:12:03.693 --> 00:12:10.635\nMycorrhiza was used in one field\nbut not in the other.\n\n00:12:11.305 --> 00:12:19.231\nAnd here, where blue indicates a better yield,\nand yellow a weaker yield.\n\n00:12:20.721 --> 00:12:23.544\nThe black rectangle is the plot\n\n00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:25.927\nfrom which the mycorrhiza was added.\n\n00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:29.295\nIn other words, as I already said,\nI have invented nothing.\n\n00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:32.045\nMycorrhiza has existed\nfor 450 million years,\n\n00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:36.304\nand it has even helped\nmodern-day plant species to diversify.\n\n00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:40.863\nSo, this it isn't something\nthat is still undergoing lab tests.\n\n00:12:40.863 --> 00:12:43.279\nMycorrhiza exists, it works,\n\n00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:47.718\nit's produced at an industrial scale\nand commercialized worldwide.\n\n00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:51.028\nThe problem is\nthat people are not aware of it.\n\n00:12:51.028 --> 00:12:55.024\nPeople like food producers and farmers\nare still not aware of this problem.\n\n00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.652\nWe have a technology that works,\n\n00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:04.749\nand one that, if used correctly,\nwill alleviate some of the pressure\n\n00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:08.402\nwe are putting\non the world's phosphorus reserves.\n\n00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:13.636\nIn conclusion,\nI am a scientist and a dreamer.\n\n00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.085\nI'm passionate about this topic.\n\n00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:19.373\nSo if you were to ask me\nwhat my retirement dream is,\n\n00:13:19.373 --> 00:13:22.199\nwhich will be at the moment we reach\nthat phosphorus peak,\n\n00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:26.155\nit would be that we use one label,\n\"Made with mycorrhiza,\"\n\n00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:29.065\nand that my children and grandchildren\n\n00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:32.073\nbuy products bearing that label too.\n\n00:13:32.073 --> 00:13:33.773\nThank you for your attention.\n\n00:13:33.773 --> 00:13:36.274\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Life in the \"digital now\"", "duration": "721", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/abha_dawesar_life_in_the_digital_now", "transcript": "I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me. Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side. Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up. I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day. And through all of this, I had to hold a torch between my teeth. The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread. For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym.But these were not the major preoccupations of my day. It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. I wasn't the only one. Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not, and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter. The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become a part of our identity, and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common. They're both stories, interpretations. You and I can experience things without a story. We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless. But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect. Our story of our life is based on direct experience, but it's embellished. A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well. It needs months and years. Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters. But the story is not about these chapters. It's the whole book. It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves. Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time. Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose. Without it, we would have no music. Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time, regret or nostalgia about the past, hope or dread about the future.I think that technology has altered that flow of time. The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk. It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time, and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world, and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers. All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second. You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations. What happens when that arrow goes awry? What happens when time warps?So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. Far away over there is now here. News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi. And that's not all. Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year, your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends, because the Internet also archives, and it warps the past. With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, and the here or there, we are left with this moment everywhere, this moment that I'll call the digital now.Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now? This digital now is not the present, because it's always a few seconds ahead, with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones. This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state. Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road. Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Are you reading an interview by an author? Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it. Like it. Find other books exactly like his. Find other people reading those books. Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose. Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly for its own sake.Not just is the digital now far from the present, but it's in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you. Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else. And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror. I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night, shop for Parisian macarons, and leave video messages that get picked up later. At all times, I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you, while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time.Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. There were those with power and water, and those without. There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months. For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true. For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. Now if this rift, which is already so great in many parts of the world, between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology, isn't somehow bridged, there will be ruptures between the digital and the real. For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. How does one live inside distraction?We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally. Possibly, but I remember my childhood. I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me. Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldn't be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact. Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments. They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.By archiving everything, we think that we can store it, but time is not data. It cannot be stored. You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment. It might have happened while we were playing an instrument, or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time. At such moments, our selves are complete. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. The present joins a flow of time from before and after.I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother. I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it. I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month. My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention. Attention is time. One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing. The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. It threatens the flow of love. But we don't need to let it. We can choose otherwise. We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be, and in our lives and in our actions, we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time. We can choose to take time back.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1856, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:14.751\nI was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,\n\n00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.991\nand this little white dog called Maui\n\n00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.876\nwas staying with me.\n\n00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:21.348\nHalf the city was dark because of a power cut,\n\n00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:23.572\nand I was living on the dark side.\n\n00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:25.681\nNow, Maui was terrified of the dark,\n\n00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.785\nso I had to carry him up the stairs,\n\n00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:30.873\nactually down the stairs first, for his walk,\n\n00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:32.761\nand then bring him back up.\n\n00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.742\nI was also hauling gallons of bottles of water\n\n00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:37.841\nup to the seventh floor every day.\n\n00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:39.414\nAnd through all of this,\n\n00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.718\nI had to hold a torch between my teeth.\n\n00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:44.362\nThe stores nearby were out of flashlights\n\n00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.299\nand batteries and bread.\n\n00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.962\nFor a shower, I walked 40 blocks\n\n00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.936\nto a branch of my gym.\n\n00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:55.015\nBut these were not the major preoccupations of my day.\n\n00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:58.316\nIt was just as critical for me to be the first person in\n\n00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:01.608\nat a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers\n\n00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:03.457\nto juice my multiple devices.\n\n00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.182\nI started to prospect under the benches of bakeries\n\n00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:09.807\nand the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.\n\n00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:11.376\nI wasn't the only one.\n\n00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:15.140\nEven in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue\n\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.604\nunder their umbrellas charging their cell phones\n\n00:01:17.604 --> 00:01:19.641\nfrom outlets on the street.\n\n00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.898\nNature had just reminded us\n\n00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.214\nthat it was stronger than all our technology,\n\n00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.483\nand yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.\n\n00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.359\nI think there's nothing like a crisis\n\n00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.548\nto tell you what's really important and what's not,\n\n00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:36.110\nand Sandy made me realize that our devices\n\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.376\nand their connectivity matter to us\n\n00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:42.894\nright up there with food and shelter.\n\n00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:46.211\nThe self as we once knew it no longer exists,\n\n00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:48.703\nand I think that an abstract, digital universe\n\n00:01:48.703 --> 00:01:51.228\nhas become a part of our identity,\n\n00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:55.480\nand I want to talk to you about what I think that means.\n\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.323\nI'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self\n\n00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:00.792\nbecause the self and fiction have a lot in common.\n\n00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.109\nThey're both stories, interpretations.\n\n00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.562\nYou and I can experience things without a story.\n\n00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.644\nWe might run up the stairs too quickly\n\n00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:10.331\nand we might get breathless.\n\n00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.861\nBut the larger sense that we have of our lives,\n\n00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.221\nthe slightly more abstract one, is indirect.\n\n00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.341\nOur story of our life is based on direct experience,\n\n00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.235\nbut it's embellished.\n\n00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.083\nA novel needs scene after scene to build,\n\n00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:27.231\nand the story of our life needs an arc as well.\n\n00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.922\nIt needs months and years.\n\n00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.940\nDiscrete moments from our lives are its chapters.\n\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.530\nBut the story is not about these chapters.\n\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.475\nIt's the whole book.\n\n00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.818\nIt's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,\n\n00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:42.997\nthe victories and the disappointments,\n\n00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.202\nbut it's because how because of these,\n\n00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:48.355\nand sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,\n\n00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.450\nwe find our place in the world\n\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.530\nand we change it and we change ourselves.\n\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.923\nOur story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:\n\n00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:59.938\na long arc of time that is our lifespan,\n\n00:02:59.938 --> 00:03:02.441\nand the timeframe of direct experience\n\n00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.894\nthat is the moment.\n\n00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:06.024\nNow the self that experiences directly\n\n00:03:06.024 --> 00:03:07.925\ncan only exist in the moment,\n\n00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.687\nbut the one that narrates needs several moments,\n\n00:03:10.687 --> 00:03:12.801\na whole sequence of them,\n\n00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:15.046\nand that's why our full sense of self\n\n00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:17.978\nneeds both immersive experience\n\n00:03:17.978 --> 00:03:20.423\nand the flow of time.\n\n00:03:20.423 --> 00:03:23.572\nNow, the flow of time is embedded in everything,\n\n00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:26.140\nin the erosion of a grain of sand,\n\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.932\nin the

it,\n\n00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:12.290\nthe challenge is to live in two streams of time\n\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.234\nthat are parallel and almost simultaneous.\n\n00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:19.334\nHow does one live inside distraction?\n\n00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:21.284\nWe might think that those younger than us,\n\n00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:24.898\nthose who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.\n\n00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:28.036\nPossibly, but I remember my childhood.\n\n00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:29.740\nI remember my grandfather revising\n\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.002\nthe capitals of the world with me.\n\n00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:34.752\nBuda and Pest were separated by the Danube,\n\n00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:37.527\nand Vienna had a Spanish riding school.\n\n00:08:37.527 --> 00:08:40.426\nIf I were a child today, I could easily learn this information\n\n00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.591\nwith apps and hyperlinks,\n\n00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:44.502\nbut it really wouldn't be the same,\n\n00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:46.782\nbecause much later, I went to Vienna,\n\n00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:48.750\nand I went to the Spanish riding school,\n\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.115\nand I could feel my grandfather right beside me.\n\n00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.685\nNight after night, he took me up on the terrace,\n\n00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:57.463\non his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter\n\n00:08:57.463 --> 00:09:00.691\nand Saturn and the Great Bear to me.\n\n00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.386\nAnd even here, when I look at the Great Bear,\n\n00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:06.142\nI get back that feeling of being a child,\n\n00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:08.520\nhanging onto his head and trying to balance myself\n\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.740\non his shoulder,\n\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.940\nand I can get back that feeling of being a child again.\n\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.407\nWhat I had with my grandfather was wrapped\n\n00:09:16.407 --> 00:09:19.649\nso often in information and knowledge and fact,\n\n00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:21.673\nbut it was about so much more\n\n00:09:21.673 --> 00:09:25.463\nthan information or knowledge or fact.\n\n00:09:25.463 -->

00:09:36.547\nand some of it becomes hard to forget,\n\n00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:39.151\neven as the current moment\n\n00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.770\nis increasingly unmemorable.\n\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.510\nWe want to clutch, and we are left instead\n\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.973\nclutching at a series of static moments.\n\n00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:49.679\nThey're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.\n\n00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:52.472\nBy archiving everything, we think that we can store it,\n\n00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:54.437\nbut time is not data.\n\n00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:56.570\nIt cannot be stored.\n\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.586\nYou and I know exactly what it means like\n\n00:09:58.586 --> 00:10:00.490\nto be truly present in a moment.\n\n00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.707\nIt might have happened while we were\n\n00:10:01.707 --> 00:10:03.466\nplaying an instrument,\n\n00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:05.314\nor looking into the eyes of someone we've known\n\n00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:07.498\nfor a very long time.\n\n00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:10.529\nAt such moments, our selves are complete.\n\n00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:12.597\nThe self that lives in the long narrative arc\n\n00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:14.680\nand the self that experiences the moment\n\n00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.072\nbecome one.\n\n00:10:16.072 --> 00:10:18.014\nThe present encapsulates the past\n\n00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:20.445\nand a promise for the future.\n\n00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:22.413\nThe present joins a flow of time\n\n00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:24.656\nfrom before and after.\n\n00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:28.213\nI first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.\n\n00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:30.552\nI wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope\n\n00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:31.904\nand she tucked up her sari\n\n00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:33.632\nand she jumped over it.\n\n00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:36.286\nI wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,\n\n00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:40.394\ncutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.\n\n00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:42.801\nMy grandmother taught me that things happen\n\n00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:46.522\nin the time they take, that time can't be fought,\n\n00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:48.355\nand because it will pass and it will move,\n\n00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:51.469\nwe owe the present moment our full attention.\n\n00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:54.113\nAttention is time.\n\n00:10:54.113 --> 00:10:56.296\nOne of my yoga instructors once said\n\n00:10:56.296 --> 00:10:58.539\nthat love is attention,\n\n00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:00.373\nand definitely from my grandmother,\n\n00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:04.699\nlove and attention were one and the same thing.\n\n00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:07.282\nThe digital world cannibalizes time,\n\n00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:10.662\nand in doing so, I want to suggest\n\n00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:12.336\nthat what it threatens\n\n00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:14.766\nis the completeness of ourselves.\n\n00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:17.124\nIt threatens the flow of love.\n\n00:11:17.124 --> 00:11:19.145\nBut we don't need to let it.\n\n00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.613\nWe can choose otherwise.\n\n00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.690\nWe've seen again and again\n\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.920\njust how creative technology can be,\n\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.160\nand in our lives and in our actions,\n\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.149\nwe can choose those solutions and those innovations\n\n00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.257\nand those moments that restore the flow of time\n\n00:11:34.257 --> 00:11:37.878\ninstead of fragmenting it.\n\n00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:40.458\nWe can slow down and we can tune in\n\n00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:43.130\nto the ebb and flow of time.\n\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.078\nWe can choose to take time back.\n\n00:11:47.078 --> 00:11:49.278\nThank you.\n\n00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:53.278\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why stay in Chernobyl? Because it's home.", "duration": "531", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/holly_morris_why_stay_in_chernobyl_because_it_s_home", "transcript": "Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation, was going berserk, and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became, and frantic. My God.I was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, as you can see by the look on my face, reluctantly so, but with good reason, because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and the sarcophagus, which is the covering over reactor number four, which was hastily built 27 years ago, now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation.So I was filming. I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. But then, I looked into the distance, and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse, and I'm thinking, who could be living here? I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air, are among the most highly contaminated on Earth, and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone, and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards. You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away, you have to have a government minder, and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. The point being, no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone. But they are.It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone. They're called self-settlers. And almost all of them are women, the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes, if not radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident, but not everybody accepted that fate. The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and, it would seem, common sense, and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. They did so illegally. As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time, \"Shoot me and dig the grave. Otherwise, I'm going home.\"Now why would they return to such deadly soil? I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently.Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated. Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident, but a few are left like this, kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy. Others have a few residents in them, one or two \"babushkas,\" or \"babas,\" which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. Another village might have six or seven residents. So this is the strange demographic of the zone \u2014 isolated alone together.And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance, I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her. She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village, population eight. (Laughter) And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious, \"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does.\"And you have to remember, these women have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century. Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor, killed millions of Ukrainians, and they faced the Nazis in the '40s, who came through slashing, burning, raping, and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. So when a couple decades into Soviet rule, Chernobyl happened, they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. So they returned to their villages and are told they're going to get sick and die soon, but five happy years, their logic goes, is better than 10 stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev, separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies, the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon. For them, environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation. It turns out this holds true for other species as well. Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned to the region in force, the very real, very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans. The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.And there is a kind of heroic resilience, a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m. pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes, their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka. And there's a patina of simple defiance among them. \"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?\" I mean, what about their health? The benefits of hardy, physical living, but an environment made toxic by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation. It's incredibly difficult to parse. Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught. The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000, eventually. Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands. Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere: higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism, unemployment and, importantly, disrupted social networks.Now, like many of you, I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life. Home is a transient concept. I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil. So it's hard for us to understand, but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka, and connection to the land is palpable. And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets, aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time.\"If you leave, you die.\"\"Those who left are worse off now. They are dying of sadness.\"\"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave.\"What sounds like faith, soft faith, may actually be fact, because the surprising truth \u2014 I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years, have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation, by some estimates up to 10 years.How could this be? Here's a theory: Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil, the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms, actually affect longevity? The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative. Home and community are forces that rival even radiation.Now radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives. In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone, and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place, full only of animals and occasionally daring, flummoxed scientists. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas, whose numbers have been halved in the three years I've known them, will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with, about the relative nature of risk, about transformative connections to home, and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1857, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:15.447\nThree years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards\n\n00:00:15.447 --> 00:00:19.073\nfrom Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.\n\n00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:22.220\nMy Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,\n\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.808\nwas going berserk,\n\n00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:27.255\nand the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,\n\n00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.051\nand frantic.

they run decidedly differently.\n\n00:02:47.077 --> 00:02:50.330\nNow around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,\n\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.661\neerily silent, strangely charming,

are left like this,\n\n00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:05.309\nkind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.\n\n00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.620\nOthers have a few residents in them,\n\n00:03:07.620 -->

might have six or seven residents.\n\n00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:19.087\nSo this is the strange demographic of the zone --\n\n00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:21.956\nisolated alone together.\n\n00:03:21.956 -->

Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment. While many people responded in different ways about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building.Why bows? I'm not quite sure. Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows. If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times. The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves. In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted mulberry trees. The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics. The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures.As I fell deeper into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. When I went on school field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag. And they would be somethings like saws, knives, sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel. I would bring the branches home, riding buses and subways, barely holding them in my hands.And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach. Airport security.(Laughter) In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust, I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape.One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire. Where? The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where 96 families call home. A customer from a department store across from my building called 911, and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned. I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom, in the audience today: Mom, I was really sorry, and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.My mother had to do a lot of explaining, telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson.I also researched extensively on bows around the world. In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. I also worked with many different types of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before.The most effective bow for me would be like this.One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow.Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power.Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage.And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like this. I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own. This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them. Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage. Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near. From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before. In the end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it.Now, I am going to show you how my bow works. And let's see how this one works. This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights. (Noise of shooting arrow) (Applause)A bow may function in a simple mechanism, but in order to make a good bow, a great amount of sensitivity is required. You need to console and communicate with the wood material. Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow.

For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoac\u00e1n family. The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city, so truly like a battlefield. After these two days, and during a particularly intense encounter, it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana, Nazario Moreno, was killed.In response to this terrifying violence, the mayor of Apatzing\u00e1n decided to call the citizens to a march for peace. The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state. And so, the day of the scheduled procession, thousands of people showed up. As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march, his team noticed that, while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white, and bearing banners asking for peace, the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now-presumed-defunct leader. Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime. And so his team stepped aside. The two marches joined together, and they continued their path towards the state capital.This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society, who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization, is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today, where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete.If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by, say, just researching online, the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal, there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others, because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence. To put these numbers in perspective, this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, which is an active civil war. This is happening just south of the border.Now as you're reading, however, you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths, because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless, nameless dead people. Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade, and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner, or, most likely, both. And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died. And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved. They were part of the bad guys. And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people.However, while it's easier to think of us, the citizens, the police, the army, as the good guys, and them, the narcos, the carteles, as the bad guys, if you think about it, the latter are only providing a service to the former. Whether we like it or not, the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world, accounting for more than half of global demand. It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South, and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, used to say, \"Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States.\"The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users of illegal drugs in the United States. Using very, very conservative assumptions, this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars. If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part, which we know is false, that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars. To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars. And it so happens that this is a product that, because of its nature, a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed. And the only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. Hence the violence. If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence, you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north. The only thing that the cartels are doing is that they're trying to protect their business.It's not only a multi-billion dollar market, but it's also a complex one. For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south, and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed. I urge you, but only a little bit, because I don't want to get you in trouble, to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it, whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S., and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message, they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less.Think about this for a second. Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless, ignorant goons that are just shooting each other, very difficult to reconcile.Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you, an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure, good incentives, a solid identity and good brand management. This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico. Because you would quickly realize, and maybe be confused by the fact, that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles. You will hear about Los Zetas, the Knights Templar, which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning, and the Sinaloa Federation. You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press, and this is somewhat true, or mostly true. But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy. You see, Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals, but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel, that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. When that corridor became contested, they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm. So they recruited Los Zetas: an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army. They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, so much so that at some point, they decided to just take over the operations, which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets, because they grow up. Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason, they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine, but what they did have, and this is again based on their military origin, was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many, many markets very effectively, which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do. And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets, this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime. That includes kidnapping, prostitution, local drug dealing and human trafficking, including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S. So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. They focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they very openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths, not to mention much better food, than what the army can deliver. The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality, they let people know that they are there, and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say, \"I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.\" If they agree \u2014 and you don't want to know what happens if they don't \u2014 they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town, in exchange for royalties. This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear, and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature, especially when they arrive first in a city, but again, that's just a brand strategy. I'm not saying they're not violent, but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all, when you count, when you do the body count, they're actually all the same.In contrast to them, the Knights Templar that arose in Michoac\u00e1n emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoac\u00e1n. Michoac\u00e1n is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico, and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico, which then gives you direct access to the U.S. The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone, and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise. They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoac\u00e1n against organized crime. Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement, so they invest heavily in providing local services, like dealing with home violence, going after petty criminals, treating addicts, and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are, and, of course, protecting people from other criminal organizations. Now, they kill a lot of people too, but when they kill them, they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them, through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos, and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us, as an organization, of course, but to you, as citizens. And so we're actually here to protect you. They, as social enterprises do, have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around, and they have very strict recruiting practices. And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions. They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade, but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoac\u00e1n, and they control the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, they leverage that to, for example, trade copper from Michoac\u00e1n that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce, and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S.Finally, the Sinaloa Federation. When you read about them, you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration, because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations, and, many people argue, the world. They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S. and the Mexican borders, but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet. They have cultivated a brand of professionalism, business acumen and innovation. They have designed new drug products and new drug processes. They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border, and you can see that these are not \"The Shawshank Redemption\" types. They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar. They have invented drones to transport drugs, catapults, you name it. One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]Like any multinational would, they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business, which is high-margin drugs like cocaine, heroine, methamphetamines. Like any traditional Latin American multinational would, the way they control their operations is through family ties. When they're entering a new market, they send a family member to supervise it, or, if they're partnering with a new organization, they create a family tie, either through marriages or other types of ties. Like any other multinational would, they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model, like for example, when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations, they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them, and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this.To further strengthen their brand, they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them. They have professional videographers on staff. They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border.And so, differences aside, what these three organizations share is on the one hand, a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top, but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time. They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies.And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things. The first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes. The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated, coherent organizations that are business organizations, and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach. The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of \"them,\" a set of bad guys separated from us, we are actually accomplices to them, either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption.These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have. We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1859, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:17.251\nIn December of 2010,\n\n00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.068\nthe city of Apatzing\u00e1n\n\n00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.220\nin the coastal state of Michoac\u00e1n, in Mexico,\n\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.590\nawoke to gunfire.\n\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.166\nFor two straight days,\n\n00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.584\nthe city became an open battlefield\n\n00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.368\nbetween the federal forces\n\n00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.037\nand a well-organized group,\n\n00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:34.820\npresumably from the local criminal organization,\n\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.192\nLa Familia Michoacana, or the Michoac\u00e1n family.\n\n00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:41.342\nThe citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire\n\n00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:43.762\nbut also explosions\n\n00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:47.033\nand burning trucks used as barricades across the city,\n\n00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.050\nso truly like a battlefield.\n\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.580\nAfter these two days,\n\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.385\nand during a particularly intense encounter,\n\n00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.952\nit was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,\n\n00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:58.457\nNazario Moreno, was killed.\n\n00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.468\nIn response to this terrifying violence,\n\n00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:02.467\nthe mayor of Apatzing\u00e1n\n\n00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:04.767\ndecided to call the citizens to a march for peace.\n\n00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.114\nThe idea was to ask for a softer approach\n\n00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.532\nto criminal activity in the state.\n\n00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:13.726\nAnd so, the day of the scheduled procession,\n\n00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.580\nthousands of people showed up.\n\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.274\nAs the mayor was preparing to deliver\n\n00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:19.385\nthe speech starting the march,\n\n00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:20.887\nhis team noticed\n\n00:01:20.887 --> 00:01:24.045\nthat, while half of the participants\n\n00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:25.720\nwere appropriately dressed in white,\n\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.560\nand bearing banners asking for peace,\n\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.729\nthe other half was actually marching\n\n00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.820\nin support of the criminal organization\n\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.004\nand its now-presumed-defunct leader.\n\n00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.073\nShocked, the mayor decided to step aside\n\n00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:42.084\nrather than participate or lead a procession\n\n00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:45.469\nthat was ostensibly in support of organized crime.\n\n00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.711\nAnd so his team stepped aside.\n\n00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.787\nThe two marches joined together,\n\n00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:52.792\nand they continued their path\n\n00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.402\ntowards the state capital.\n\n00:01:55.402 --> 00:02:00.213\nThis story of horrific violence\n\n00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:02.410\nfollowed by a fumbled approach\n\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.605\nby federal and local authorities as they tried\n\n00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:06.028\nto engage civil society,\n\n00:02:06.028 --> 00:02:09.384\nwho has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,\n\n00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:12.848\nis a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,\n\n00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:16.197\nwhere we see that our current understanding\n\n00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:18.565\nof drug violence and what leads to it\n\n00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.167\nis probably at the very least incomplete.\n\n00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.170\nIf you decided to spend 30 minutes trying\n\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.200\nto figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico\n\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.839\nby, say, just researching online,\n\n00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.680\nthe first thing you would find out is that\n\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.647\nwhile the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,\n\n00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:34.766\nthere are some that are more\n\n00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:38.125\nand there are some that are much less equal than others,\n\n00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.376\nbecause you will quickly find out\n\n00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:41.080\nthat in the past six years\n\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.228\nanywhere between 60 and 100,000 people\n\n00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:46.786\nhave lost their lives in drug-related violence.\n\n00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.533\nTo put these numbers in perspective,\n\n00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.349\nthis is eight times larger than the number of casualties\n\n00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.870\nin the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.\n\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.374\nIt's also shockingly close to the number of people\n\n00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:00.900\nwho have died in the Syrian civil war,\n\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.113\nwhich is an active civil war.\n\n00:03:03.113 --> 00:03:06.309\nThis is happening just south of the border.\n\n00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.913\nNow as you're reading, however,\n\n00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:09.596\nyou will be maybe surprised that you will quickly\n\n00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.632\nbecome numb to the numbers of deaths,\n\n00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:15.318\nbecause you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers\n\n00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:18.911\nof faceless, nameless dead people.\n\n00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.635\nImplicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative\n\n00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.470\nthat all the people who are dying\n\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.326\nwere somehow involved in the drug trade,\n\n00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:29.922\nand we infer this because they were either tortured\n\n00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:32.083\nor executed in a professional manner,\n\n00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.735\nor, most likely, both.\n\n00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:35.716\nAnd so clearly they were criminals\n\n00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.331\nbecause of the way they died.\n\n00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:40.894\nAnd so the narrative is that somehow these people\n\n00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:42.137\ngot what they were deserved.\n\n00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:44.588\nThey were part of the bad guys.\n\n00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:47.136\nAnd that creates some form of comfort\n\n00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:48.768\nfor a lot of people.\n\n00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:51.732\nHowever, while it's easier to think\n\n00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:55.717\nof us, the citizens, the police, the army,\n\n00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:59.289\nas the good guys, and them, the narcos,\n\n00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.583\nthe carteles, as the bad guys,\n\n00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:03.749\nif you think about it,\n\n00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.557\nthe latter are only providing a service to the former.\n\n00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:09.672\nWhether we like it or not,\n\n00:04:09.672 --> 00:04:12.333\nthe U.S. is the largest market\n\n00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.951\nfor illegal substances in the world,\n\n00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:17.005\naccounting for more than half of global demand.\n\n00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.265\nIt shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico\n\n00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:23.383\nthat is its only route of access from the South,\n\n00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:26.438\nand so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,\n\n00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:29.167\nused to say, \"Poor Mexico,\n\n00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:35.359\nso far from God and so close to the United States.\"\n\n00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:38.208\nThe U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users\n\n00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:40.675\nof illegal drugs in the United States.\n\n00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:43.101\nUsing very, very conservative assumptions,\n\n00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.198\nthis yields a yearly drug market on the retail side\n\n00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:48.981\nof anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.\n\n00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:51.650\nIf we assume that the narcos only have access\n\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.374\nto the wholesale part, which we know is false,\n\n00:04:54.374 --> 00:04:56.715\nthat still leaves you with yearly revenues\n\n00:04:56.715 --> 00:05:01.233\nof anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.\n\n00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.149\nTo put these numbers in perspective,\n\n00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:07.942\nMicrosoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.\n\n00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:10.448\nAnd it so happens that this is a product that,\n\n00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:13.423\nbecause of its nature, a business model\n\n00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.177\nto address this market requires you\n\n00:05:16.177 --> 00:05:18.306\nto guarantee to your producers\n\n00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:20.924\nthat their product will be reliably placed\n\n00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:23.041\nin the markets where it is consumed.\n\n00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:26.598\nAnd the only way to do this, because it's illegal,\n\n00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:29.608\nis to have absolute control of the geographic corridors\n\n00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:31.907\nthat are used to transport drugs.\n\n00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:34.424\nHence the violence.\n\n00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:37.456\nIf you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,\n\n00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:39.576\nyou will see that it almost perfectly aligns\n\n00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.360\nwith the most efficient routes of transportation\n\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.255\nfrom the south to the north.\n\n00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:44.411\nThe only thing that the cartels are doing\n\n00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.162\nis that they're trying to protect their business.\n\n00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.587\nIt's not only a multi-billion dollar market,\n\n00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:51.682\nbut it's also a complex one.\n\n00:05:51.682 --> 00:05:54.391\nFor example, the coca plant is a fragile plant\n\n00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:56.722\nthat can only grow in certain latitudes,\n\n00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:58.458\nand so it means that a business model\n\n00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.193\nto address this market requires you to have\n\n00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.714\ndecentralized, international production,\n\n00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:05.258\nthat by the way needs to have good quality control,\n\n00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:07.759\nbecause people need a good high\n\n00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.344\nthat is not going to kill them\n\n00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:12.206\nand that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.\n\n00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.199\nAnd so that means they need to secure\n\n00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.101\nproduction and quality control in the south,\n\n00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:19.108\nand you need to ensure that you have\n\n00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.600\nefficient and effective distribution channels\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.039\nin the markets where these drugs are consumed.\n\n00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.630\nI urge you, but only a little bit,\n\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.841\nbecause I don't want to get you in trouble,\n\n00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.127\nto just ask around and see how difficult it would be\n\n00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.984\nto get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,\n\n00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:37.929\nwhenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,\n\n00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.742\nand some of you may be surprised to know\n\n00:06:40.742 --> 00:06:42.756\nthat there are many dealers that offer a service\n\n00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:44.580\nwhere if you send them a text message,\n\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.285\nthey guarantee delivery of the drug\n\n00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:49.167\nin 30 minutes or less.\n\n00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.588\nThink about this for a second.\n\n00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:53.319\nThink about the complexity\n\n00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.719\nof the distribution network that I just described.\n\n00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.217\nIt's very difficult to reconcile this\n\n00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:03.339\nwith the image of faceless, ignorant goons\n\n00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.944\nthat are just shooting each other,\n\n00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:07.632\nvery difficult to reconcile.\n\n00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:10.961\nNow, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,\n\n00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:13.636\nan effective organization requires\n\n00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:15.545\nan integrated strategy that includes\n\n00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:18.418\na good organizational structure, good incentives,\n\n00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:21.410\na solid identity and good brand management.\n\n00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.545\nThis leads me to the second thing that you would learn\n\n00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:26.445\nin your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.\n\n00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:28.007\nBecause you would quickly realize,\n\n00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:29.670\nand maybe be confused by the fact,\n\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.907\nthat there are three organizations\n\n00:07:30.907 --> 00:07:34.442\nthat are constantly named in the articles.\n\n00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:36.516\nYou will hear about Los Zetas,\n\n00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:38.487\nthe Knights Templar, which is the new brand\n\n00:07:38.487 --> 00:07:41.345\nfor the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,\n\n00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:43.719\nand the Sinaloa Federation.\n\n00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.510\nYou will read that Los Zetas is this assortment\n\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.865\nof sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter\n\n00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:52.991\nand they silence the press,\n\n00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.365\nand this is somewhat true, or mostly true.\n\n00:07:56.365 --> 00:08:00.444\nBut this is the result of a very careful branding\n\n00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:02.245\nand business strategy.\n\n00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.414\nYou see, Los Zetas is not just\n\n00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:06.214\nthis random assortment of individuals,\n\n00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:09.869\nbut was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,\n\n00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:12.881\nthat used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.\n\n00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:15.295\nWhen that corridor became contested, they decided\n\n00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.085\nthat they wanted to recruit\n\n00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:19.916\na professional enforcement arm.\n\n00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.525\nSo they recruited Los Zetas:\n\n00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:26.283\nan entire unit of elite paratroopers\n\n00:08:26.283 --> 00:08:29.300\nfrom the Mexican Army.\n\n00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.006\nThey were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,\n\n00:08:33.006 --> 00:08:34.894\nso much so that at some point, they decided\n\n00:08:34.894 --> 00:08:37.387\nto just take over the operations,\n\n00:08:37.387 --> 00:08:41.181\nwhich is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,\n\n00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:43.822\nbecause they grow up.\n\n00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:47.518\nBecause the Zetas organization was founded in treason,\n\n00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:50.454\nthey lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution\n\n00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:52.661\nin the most profitable markets like cocaine,\n\n00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:53.951\nbut what they did have,\n\n00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:56.411\nand this is again based on their military origin,\n\n00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.258\nwas a perfectly structured chain of command\n\n00:08:59.258 --> 00:09:01.883\nwith a very clear hierarchy\n\n00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:05.947\nand a very clear promotion path that allowed them\n\n00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:09.769\nto supervise and operate across many, many markets\n\n00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:11.411\nvery effectively,\n\n00:09:11.411 --> 00:09:15.210\nwhich is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.\n\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.499\nAnd so because they didn't have access\n\n00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:18.834\nto the more profitable drug markets,\n\n00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:20.507\nthis pushed them and gave them the opportunity\n\n00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:24.005\nto diversify into other forms of crime.\n\n00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:28.060\nThat includes kidnapping, prostitution,\n\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.241\nlocal drug dealing and human trafficking,\n\n00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:34.197\nincluding of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.\n\n00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:38.445\nSo what they currently run is truly\n\n00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:42.017\nand quite literally a franchise business.\n\n00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:45.848\nThey focus most of their recruiting on the army,\n\n00:09:45.848 --> 00:09:48.925\nand they very openly advertise for better salaries,\n\n00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:51.623\nbetter benefits, better promotion paths,\n\n00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:53.271\nnot to mention much better food,\n\n00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.978\nthan what the army can deliver.\n\n00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:57.847\nThe way they operate is that\n\n00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.752\nwhen they arrive in a locality,\n\n00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:01.503\nthey let people know that they are there,\n\n00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:04.573\nand they go to the most powerful local gang\n\n00:10:04.573 --> 00:10:06.813\nand they say, \"I offer you\n\n00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:10.002\nto be the local representative of the Zeta brand.\"\n\n00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.875\nIf they agree -- and you don't want to know\n\n00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:13.618\nwhat happens if they don't --\n\n00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:15.305\nthey train them and they supervise them\n\n00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:18.632\non how to run the most efficient criminal operation\n\n00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:22.133\nfor that town, in exchange for royalties.\n\n00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:24.039\nThis kind of business model obviously depends\n\n00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.436\nentirely on having a very effective brand of fear,\n\n00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:28.809\nand so Los Zetas\n\n00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:31.102\ncarefully stage acts of violence\n\n00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:33.035\nthat are spectacular in nature,\n\n00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:35.835\nespecially when they arrive first in a city,\n\n00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:39.069\nbut again, that's just a brand strategy.\n\n00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:40.968\nI'm not saying they're not violent,\n\n00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:42.911\nbut what I am saying is that even though you will read\n\n00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:44.774\nthat they are the most violent of all,\n\n00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.737\nwhen you count, when you do the body count,\n\n00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:51.509\nthey're actually all the same.\n\n00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:54.597\nIn contrast to them, the Knights Templar\n\n00:10:54.597 --> 00:10:56.437\nthat arose in Michoac\u00e1n\n\n00:10:56.437 --> 00:10:59.044\nemerged in reaction to the incursion\n\n00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:01.579\nof the Zetas into the state of Michoac\u00e1n.\n\n00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:04.496\nMichoac\u00e1n is a geographically strategic state\n\n00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:06.499\nbecause it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,\n\n00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.090\nand it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,\n\n00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.156\nwhich then gives you direct access to the U.S.\n\n00:11:12.156 --> 00:11:13.695\nThe Knights Templar realized very quickly\n\n00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:17.203\nthat they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,\n\n00:11:17.203 --> 00:11:19.560\nand so they developed a strategy\n\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.339\nas a social enterprise.\n\n00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:25.339\nThey brand themselves as representative of\n\n00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:27.995\nand protecting of the citizens of Michoac\u00e1n\n\n00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:30.293\nagainst organized crime.\n\n00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:32.024\nTheir brand of social enterprise means\n\n00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.075\nthat they require a lot of civic engagement,\n\n00:11:34.075 --> 00:11:38.241\nso they invest heavily in providing local services,\n\n00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:41.739\nlike dealing with home violence,\n\n00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:45.515\ngoing after petty criminals, treating addicts,\n\n00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:48.293\nand keeping drugs out of the local markets\n\n00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:50.773\nwhere they are,\n\n00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:52.392\nand, of course, protecting people\n\n00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:54.883\nfrom other criminal organizations.\n\n00:11:54.883 --> 00:11:57.914\nNow, they kill a lot of people too,\n\n00:11:57.914 --> 00:12:00.011\nbut when they kill them,\n\n00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:02.926\nthey provide very careful narratives and descriptions\n\n00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:04.178\nfor why they did them,\n\n00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:08.141\nthrough newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,\n\n00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:10.607\nand billboards that explain that the people who were killed\n\n00:12:10.607 --> 00:12:12.935\nwere killed because they represented a threat\n\n00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:14.791\nnot to us, as an organization, of course,\n\n00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:16.727\nbut to you, as citizens.\n\n00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:19.183\nAnd so we're actually here to protect you.\n\n00:12:19.183 --> 00:12:21.747\nThey, as social enterprises do,\n\n00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:23.247\nhave created a moral and ethical code\n\n00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.616\nthat they advertise around,\n\n00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:28.754\nand they have very strict recruiting practices.\n\n00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:30.577\nAnd here you have the types of explanations\n\n00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:34.518\nthat they provide for some of their actions.\n\n00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.414\nThey have actually retained access\n\n00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:38.714\nto the profitable drug trade,\n\n00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.924\nbut the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoac\u00e1n,\n\n00:12:40.924 --> 00:12:43.067\nand they control the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas,\n\n00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:44.869\nthey leverage that to, for example,\n\n00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:48.426\ntrade copper from Michoac\u00e1n that is legally created\n\n00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:49.826\nand legally extracted\n\n00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:51.828\nwith illegal ephedrine from China\n\n00:12:51.828 --> 00:12:55.252\nwhich is a critical precursor for methamphetamines\n\n00:12:55.252 --> 00:12:57.652\nthat they produce, and then they have partnerships\n\n00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.190\nwith larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation\n\n00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.880\nthat place their products in the U.S.\n\n00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.551\nFinally, the Sinaloa Federation.\n\n00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.749\nWhen you read about them, you will often read about them\n\n00:13:07.749 --> 00:13:11.449\nwith an undertone of reverence and admiration,\n\n00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:13.365\nbecause they are the most integrated\n\n00:13:13.365 --> 00:13:15.653\nand the largest of all the Mexican organizations,\n\n00:13:15.653 --> 00:13:19.107\nand, many people argue, the world.\n\n00:13:19.107 --> 00:13:22.091\nThey started as just sort of a transport organization\n\n00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.165\nthat specialized in smuggling between the U.S.\n\n00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:26.290\nand the Mexican borders,\n\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.708\nbut now they have grown\n\n00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.134\ninto a truly integrated multinational\n\n00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:33.440\nthat has partnerships in production in the south\n\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.453\nand partnerships in global distribution\n\n00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:38.947\nacross the planet.\n\n00:13:38.947 --> 00:13:42.277\nThey have cultivated a brand of professionalism,\n\n00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:45.595\nbusiness acumen and innovation.\n\n00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.694\nThey have designed new drug products\n\n00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.417\nand new drug processes.\n\n00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.635\nThey have designed narco-tunnels\n\n00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:53.176\nthat go across the border,\n\n00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.991\nand you can see that these are not\n\n00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:58.939\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" types.\n\n00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:02.635\nThey have invented narco-submarines and boats\n\n00:14:02.635 --> 00:14:05.318\nthat are not detected by radar.\n\n00:14:05.318 --> 00:14:07.881\nThey have invented drones to transport drugs,\n\n00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:11.167\ncatapults, you name it.\n\n00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:13.508\nOne of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation\n\n00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:15.946\nactually made it to the Forbes list.\n\n00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:17.919\n[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]\n\n00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:20.824\nLike any multinational would, they have specialized\n\n00:14:20.824 --> 00:14:23.113\nand focused only in the most profitable part of the business,\n\n00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.791\nwhich is high-margin drugs like cocaine,\n\n00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:28.076\nheroine, methamphetamines.\n\n00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.649\nLike any traditional Latin American multinational would,\n\n00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:32.390\nthe way they control their operations\n\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.172\nis through family ties.\n\n00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.117\nWhen they're entering a new market, they send\n\n00:14:36.117 --> 00:14:37.838\na family member to supervise it,\n\n00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:40.655\nor, if they're partnering with a new organization,\n\n00:14:40.655 --> 00:14:42.075\nthey create a family tie,\n\n00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:46.541\neither through marriages or other types of ties.\n\n00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:48.704\nLike any other multinational would,\n\n00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:51.871\nthey protect their brand by outsourcing\n\n00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:54.039\nthe more questionable parts of the business model,\n\n00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:56.082\nlike for example, when they have to engage\n\n00:14:56.082 --> 00:14:58.847\nin violence against other criminal organizations,\n\n00:14:58.847 --> 00:15:02.292\nthey recruit gangs and other smaller players\n\n00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:04.091\nto do the dirty work for them,\n\n00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:05.876\nand they try to separate their operations\n\n00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:09.511\nand their violence and be very discrete about this.\n\n00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:12.007\nTo further strengthen their brand,\n\n00:15:12.007 --> 00:15:14.900\nthey actually have professional P.R. firms\n\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.379\nthat shape how the press talks about them.\n\n00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:20.930\nThey have professional videographers on staff.\n\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.043\nThey have incredibly productive ties\n\n00:15:23.043 --> 00:15:24.876\nwith the security organizations\n\n00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:28.288\non both sides of the border.\n\n00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:30.889\nAnd so, differences aside,\n\n00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:34.444\nwhat these three organizations share\n\n00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:38.084\nis on the one hand, a very clear understanding\n\n00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:41.168\nthat institutions cannot be imposed from the top,\n\n00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:44.108\nbut rather they are built from the bottom up\n\n00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:47.391\none interaction at a time.\n\n00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:49.812\nThey have created extremely coherent structures\n\n00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:52.646\nthat they use to show the inconsistencies\n\n00:15:52.646 --> 00:15:56.673\nin government policies.\n\n00:15:56.673 --> 00:15:59.160\nAnd so what I want you to remember from this talk\n\n00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.693\nare three things.\n\n00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.749\nThe first one is that drug violence\n\n00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:05.626\nis actually the result\n\n00:16:05.626 --> 00:16:08.877\nof a huge market demand\n\n00:16:08.877 --> 00:16:12.527\nand an institutional setup that forces\n\n00:16:12.527 --> 00:16:15.653\nthe servicing of this market to necessitate violence\n\n00:16:15.653 --> 00:16:19.698\nto guarantee delivery routes.\n\n00:16:19.698 --> 00:16:21.624\nThe second thing I want you to remember\n\n00:16:21.624 --> 00:16:23.570\nis that these are sophisticated,\n\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.493\ncoherent organizations\n\n00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:28.451\nthat are business organizations,\n\n00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:30.370\nand analyzing them and treating them as such\n\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.759\nis probably a much more useful approach.\n\n00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.895\nThe third thing I want you to remember\n\n00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:37.323\nis that even though we're more comfortable\n\n00:16:37.323 --> 00:16:39.846\nwith this idea of \"them,\"\n\n00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:42.587\na set of bad guys separated from us,\n\n00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:45.564\nwe are actually accomplices to them,\n\n00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:47.953\neither through our direct consumption\n\n00:16:47.953 --> 00:16:52.025\nor through our acceptance of the inconsistency\n\n00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:54.293\nbetween our policies of prohibition\n\n00:16:54.293 --> 00:16:57.241\nand our actual behavior of tolerance\n\n00:16:57.241 --> 00:17:01.465\nor even encouragement of consumption.\n\n00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:05.485\nThese organizations service, recruit from,\n\n00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:07.813\nand operate within our communities,\n\n00:17:07.813 --> 00:17:10.231\nso necessarily, they are much more integrated\n\n00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:14.701\nwithin them than we are comfortable acknowledging.\n\n00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.566\nAnd so to me the question is not whether\n\n00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:20.847\nthese dynamics will continue the way they have.\n\n00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:23.612\nWe see that the nature of this phenomenon\n\n00:17:23.612 --> 00:17:26.080\nguarantees that they will.\n\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.960\nThe question is whether we are willing to continue\n\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.566\nour support of a failed strategy\n\n00:17:33.566 --> 00:17:39.073\nbased on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance\n\n00:17:39.073 --> 00:17:44.034\nat the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.\n\n00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:45.765\nThank you.\n\n00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:50.927\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What I discovered in New York City  trash", "duration": "472", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_nagle_what_i_discovered_in_new_york_city_trash", "transcript": "I was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. It was a beautiful day. The forest was sparkling. The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were following, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land.We got to our campsite. It was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal, beautiful lake, when I discovered a horror. Behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker. And I was astonished, I was very angry, and I was deeply confused. The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them?That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little. Who cleans up after us? However you configure or wherever you place the us, who cleans up after us in Istanbul? Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London? Here in New York, the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us, to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day. I wanted to get to know them as individuals. I wanted to understand who takes the job. What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden?So I started a research project with them. I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still an outsider. I needed to go deeper.So I took the job as a sanitation worker. I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks. And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education.Everyone asks about the smell. It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly. The weight takes a long time to get used to. I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week.Then there's the danger. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country, and I learned why. You're in and out of traffic all day, and it's zooming around you. It just wants to get past you, so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. That's really bad for the worker. And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm.I also learned about the relentlessness of trash. When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. It never stops coming. It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. It must always be in motion.And then there's the stigma. You put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. I find the stigma especially ironic, because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons. They are the first guardians of public health. If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its containments, and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. The economy needs them. If we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship. And then there's what I call our average, necessary quotidian velocity. By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water. We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them, because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away.So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical. They're on the streets every day, rhythmically. They wear a uniform in many cities. You know when to expect them. And their work lets us do our work. They are almost a form of reassurance. The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what.On the day after September 11 in 2001, I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street, and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday. And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cry. And he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said, \"We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay.\" It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation, and I met that man again. His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends.I want to believe that Paulie was right. We are going to be okay. But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor. And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage, accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. It's a remarkable statistic.So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. Take a moment to say thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1858, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:14.530\nI was about 10 years old\n\n00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.229\non a camping trip with my dad\n\n00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.989\nin the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area\n\n00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.984\nin the northern part of New York State.\n\n00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:23.425\nIt was a beautiful day.\n\n00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.427\nThe forest was sparkling.\n\n00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:28.951\nThe sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,\n\n00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.156\nand if it weren't for the path we were following,\n\n00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.560\nwe could almost pretend we were\n\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.122\nthe first human beings to ever walk that land.\n\n00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.773\nWe got to our campsite.\n\n00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:40.740\nIt was a lean-to on a bluff\n\n00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.436\nlooking over a crystal, beautiful lake,\n\n00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.132\nwhen I discovered a horror.\n\n00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:49.230\nBehind the lean-to was a dump,\n\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.688\nmaybe 40 feet square\n\n00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:53.001\nwith rotting apple cores\n\n00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.748\nand balled-up aluminum foil,\n\n00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:56.497\nand a dead sneaker.\n\n00:00:56.497 --> 00:00:59.068\nAnd I was astonished,\n\n00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:02.500\nI was very angry, and I was deeply confused.\n\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.082\nThe campers who were too lazy\n\n00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:06.040\nto take out what they had brought in,\n\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.885\nwho did they think would clean up after them?\n\n00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.794\nThat question stayed with me,\n\n00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:13.761\nand it simplified a little.\n\n00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.137\nWho cleans up after us?\n\n00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:17.559\nHowever you configure\n\n00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:19.266\nor wherever you place the us,\n\n00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.856\nwho cleans up after us in Istanbul?\n\n00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:24.112\nWho cleans up after us in Rio\n\n00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:26.641\nor in Paris or in London?\n\n00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.213\nHere in New York,\n\n00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.805\nthe Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,\n\n00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.475\nto the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage\n\n00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:37.837\nand 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.\n\n00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:40.470\nI wanted to get to know them as individuals.\n\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.316\nI wanted to understand who takes the job.\n\n00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:45.835\nWhat's it like to wear the uniform\n\n00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.489\nand bear that burden?\n\n00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.142\nSo I started a research project with them.\n\n00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.681\nI rode in the trucks and walked the routes\n\n00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.090\nand interviewed people in offices and facilities\n\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.597\nall over the city,\n\n00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:58.336\nand I learned a lot,\n\n00:01:58.336 --> 00:02:00.685\nbut I was still an outsider.\n\n00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.563\nI needed to go deeper.\n\n00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:05.679\nSo I took the job as a sanitation worker.\n\n00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.326\nI didn't just ride in the trucks now.

00:05:00.314\non the other side that's going to take it all away.\n\n00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:02.761\nSo I want to suggest today a couple of ways\n\n00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:07.275\nto think about sanitation that will perhaps help\n\n00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:09.749\nameliorate the stigma\n\n00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:11.980\nand bring them into this conversation\n\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.570\nof how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.\n\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.731\nTheir work, I think, is kind of liturgical.\n\n00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.192\nThey're on the streets every day, rhythmically.\n\n00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:26.253\nThey wear a uniform in many cities.\n\n00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:28.122\nYou know when to expect them.\n\n00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:32.045\nAnd their work lets us do our work.\n\n00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:34.836\nThey are almost a form of reassurance.\n\n00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.573\nThe flow that they maintain\n\n00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:38.563\nkeeps us safe from ourselves,\n\n00:05:38.563 --> 00:05:41.200\nfrom our own dross, our cast-offs,\n\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.458\nand that flow must be maintained always\n\n00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.091\nno matter what.\n\n00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.815\nOn the day after September 11 in 2001,\n\n00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:53.102\nI heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,\n\n00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.414\nand I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs\n\n00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:58.256\nand there was a man doing his paper recycling route\n\n00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:00.438\nlike he did every Wednesday.\n\n00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:02.858\nAnd I tried to thank him for doing his work\n\n00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:04.983\non that day of all days,\n\n00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.584\nbut I started to cry.\n\n00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:09.268\nAnd he looked at me,\n\n00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:12.692\nand he just nodded, and he said,\n\n00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:15.570\n\"We're going to be okay.\n\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.211\nWe're going to be okay.\"\n\n00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.564\nIt was a little while later that I started\n\n00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:20.944\nmy research with sanitation,\n\n00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:22.358\nand I met that man again.\n\n00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:25.275\nHis name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,\n\n00:06:25.275 --> 00:06:27.098\nand we became good friends.\n\n00:06:27.098 --> 00:06:29.925\nI want to believe that Paulie was right.\n\n00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:32.127\nWe are going to be okay.\n\n00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.104\nBut in

My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury, which affects more than 50,000 people around the world every year, with dramatic consequences for affected individuals, whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds.And for me, the Man of Steel, Christopher Reeve, has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research, working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.I still remember this decisive moment. It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts, \"You have to be more pragmatic. When leaving your laboratory tomorrow, I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step, struggling to maintain their trunk. And when you go home, think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better.\"These words, they stuck with me. This was more than 10 years ago, but ever since, my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury. And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions. And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body. They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord, thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg. But, as observed, after most injuries in humans, there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur. But how to make it happen?Well, the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. And while this certainly remained the key for a cure, this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me. To reach clinical fruition rapidly, it was obvious: I had to think about the problem differently.It turned out that more than 100 years of research on spinal cord physiology, starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington, had shown that the spinal cord, below most injuries, contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion, but because input from the brain is interrupted, they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant. My idea: We awaken this network.And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles, after completing my Ph.D. in France, where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted. (Laughter) I was afraid to talk to my new boss, but decided to muster up my courage. I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor, Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.He listened to me carefully, and responded with a grin. \"Why don't you try?\"And I promise to you, this was such an important moment in my career, when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas.And this was the idea: I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept. Imagine that the locomotor system is a car. The engine is the spinal cord. The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off. How could we re-engage the engine? First, we have to provide the fuel; second, press the accelerator pedal; third, steer the car. It turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion. My idea: Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience, first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire, and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation. So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation. It took many years, but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state. Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand. As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving, the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg, but without the brain. Here what I call \"the spinal brain\" cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand, to walk, to run, and even here, while sprinting, instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving.This was amazing. I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain, but at the same time so frustrated. This locomotion was completely involuntary. The animal had virtually no control over the legs. Clearly, the steering system was missing. And it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm, stepping on a treadmill, and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.With this in mind, we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space. Imagine, this is really cool. So imagine the little 200-gram rat attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot, but the rat does not feel the robot. The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps.Let me summarize: The rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord. The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks. The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs. And for motivation, we used what I think is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland: fine Swiss chocolate.(Laughter)Actually, the first results were very, very, very disappointing. Here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step, whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier, walked beautifully on the treadmill. We were so frustrated.But you know, one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. We insisted. We refined our paradigm, and after several months of training, the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand, and whenever she decided, initiated full weight-bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards. This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis.In fact \u2014(Applause)Thank you.In fact, not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground, they could even adjust leg movement, for example, to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase. I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory. It took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal.But the remaining question was, how? I mean, how is it possible? And here, what we found was completely unexpected. This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections, some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury. And here, you can see one such example, where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red. This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center, and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area. It occurred throughout the central nervous system, including in the brain stem, where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain. We did not aim to repair the spinal cord, yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury.And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery. They are the result of a young team of very talented people: physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons, engineers of all kinds, who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals. This is truly a trans-disciplinary team. They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. We are creating the next generation of M.D.'s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside. And me? I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you, will this help injured people? Me too, every day. The truth is that we don't know enough yet. This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury, but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life.I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me. Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. After a few weeks of recovery, we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord. At the same time, we will implant an electrode array, a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement, and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs. This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system. And my hope is that after several months of training, there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot, maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation. My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord. And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders, what I termed \"personalized neuroprosthetics,\" where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces, I implanted throughout the nervous system, in the brain, in the spinal cord, even in peripheral nerves, based on patient-specific impairments. But not to replace the lost function, no \u2014 to help the brain help itself.And I hope this enticed your imagination, because I can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur, but when. And remember, we are only as great as our imagination, as big as our dream.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1860, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.404 -->

don't you try?\"\n\n00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:55.353\nAnd I promise to you,\n\n00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:58.708\nthis was such an important moment in my career,\n\n00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.143\nwhen I realized that the great leader\n\n00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:04.136\nbelieved in young people and new ideas.\n\n00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:05.744\nAnd this was the idea:\n\n00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:08.410\nI'm going to use a simplistic metaphor\n\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.536\nto explain to you this complicated concept.\n\n00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:15.302\nImagine that the locomotor system is a car.\n\n00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:17.548\nThe engine is the spinal cord.\n\n00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:20.806\nThe transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.\n\n00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:23.813\nHow could we re-engage the engine?\n\n00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:26.955\nFirst, we have to provide the fuel;\n\n00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:29.298\nsecond, press the accelerator pedal;\n\n00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:31.236\nthird, steer the car.\n\n00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:32.998\nIt turned out that there are known neural pathways\n\n00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:35.952\ncoming from the brain that play this very function\n\n00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.334\nduring locomotion.\n\n00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:40.049\nMy idea: Replace this missing input\n\n00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:41.451\nto provide the spinal cord\n\n00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:42.847\nwith the kind of intervention\n\n00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:47.577\nthat the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.\n\n00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:52.016\nFor this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,\n\n00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.780\nfirst to replace the missing fuel\n\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.848\nwith pharmacological agents\n\n00:04:56.848 --> 00:05:00.328\nthat prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,\n\n00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:04.383\nand second, to mimic the accelerator pedal\n\n00:05:04.383 --> 00:05:05.863\nwith electrical stimulation.\n\n00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:08.032\nSo here imagine an electrode\n\n00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:10.438\nimplanted on the back of the spinal cord\n\n00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:12.700\nto deliver painless stimulation.\n\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.532\nIt took many years, but eventually we developed\n\n00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:18.089\nan electrochemical neuroprosthesis\n\n00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:19.855\nthat transformed the neural network\n\n00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:24.861\nin the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.\n\n00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:31.141\nImmediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.\n\n00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:33.468\nAs soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,\n\n00:05:33.468 --> 00:05:37.274\nthe animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,\n\n00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:39.252\nbut without the brain.\n\n00:05:39.252 --> 00:05:41.242\nHere what I call \"the spinal brain\"\n\n00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:44.364\ncognitively processes sensory information\n\n00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.259\narising from the moving leg\n\n00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.954\nand makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle\n\n00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:53.344\nin order to stand, to walk, to run,\n\n00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:55.456\nand even here, while sprinting,\n\n00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:57.753\ninstantly stand\n\n00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.216\nif the treadmill stops moving.\n\n00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.553\nThis was amazing.\n\n00:06:01.553 --> 00:06:04.940\nI was completely fascinated by this locomotion\n\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.435\nwithout the brain,\n\n00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:11.090\nbut at the same time so frustrated.\n\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.483\nThis locomotion was completely involuntary.\n\n00:06:13.483 --> 00:06:16.848\nThe animal had virtually no control over the legs.\n\n00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:20.968\nClearly, the steering system was missing.\n\n00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:22.860\nAnd it then became obvious from me\n\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.208\nthat we had to move away\n\n00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.580\nfrom the classical rehabilitation paradigm,\n\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.302\nstepping on a treadmill,\n\n00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.522\nand develop conditions that would encourage\n\n00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:37.755\nthe brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.\n\n00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:41.140\nWith this in mind, we developed a completely new\n\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.370\nrobotic system to support the rat\n\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.896\nin any direction of space.\n\n00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:49.071\nImagine, this is really cool.\n\n00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:52.902\nSo imagine the little 200-gram rat\n\n00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:56.603\nattached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,\n\n00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:59.175\nbut the rat does not feel the robot.\n\n00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:01.247\nThe robot is transparent,\n\n00:07:01.247 --> 00:07:03.609\njust like you would hold a young child\n\n00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:05.973\nduring the first insecure steps.\n\n00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:09.527\nLet me summarize: The rat received\n\n00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:11.972\na paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.\n\n00:07:11.972 --> 00:07:14.562\nThe electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled\n\n00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:18.769\na highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.\n\n00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:22.535\nThe robot provided the safe environment\n\n00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:24.498\nto allow the rat to attempt anything\n\n00:07:24.498 --> 00:07:27.180\nto engage the paralyzed legs.\n\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.005\nAnd for motivation, we used what I think\n\n00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:33.839\nis the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:\n\n00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:36.146\nfine Swiss chocolate.\n\n00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:39.068\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:43.631\nActually, the first results were very, very,\n\n00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:46.266\nvery disappointing.\n\n00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:49.568\nHere is my best physical therapist\n\n00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:59.342\ncompletely failing to encourage the rat\n\n00:07:59.342 --> 00:08:01.403\nto take a single step,\n\n00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:04.249\nwhereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,\n\n00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.555\nwalked beautifully on the treadmill.\n\n00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.712\nWe were so frustrated.\n\n00:08:08.712 --> 00:08:11.611\nBut you know, one of the most essential qualities\n\n00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:14.087\nof a scientist is perseverance.\n\n00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:17.503\nWe insisted. We refined our paradigm,\n\n00:08:17.503 --> 00:08:19.766\nand after several months of training,\n\n00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:23.572\nthe otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,\n\n00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:25.384\nand whenever she decided,\n\n00:08:25.384 --> 00:08:27.716\ninitiated full weight-bearing locomotion\n\n00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.966\nto sprint towards the rewards.\n\n00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:34.371\nThis is the first recovery ever observed\n\n00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.265\nof voluntary leg movement\n\n00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.719\nafter an experimental lesion of the spinal cord\n\n00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:42.180\nleading to complete and permanent paralysis.\n\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.167\nIn fact --\n\n00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.887\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:45.887 --> 00:08:50.266\nThank you.\n\n00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:53.360\nIn fact, not only could the rat initiate\n\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.037\nand sustain locomotion on the ground,\n\n00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:58.318\nthey could even adjust leg movement,\n\n00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:00.674\nfor example, to resist gravity\n\n00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.298\nin order to climb a staircase.\n\n00:09:03.298 --> 00:09:05.248\nI can promise you this was\n\n00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:08.357\nsuch an emotional moment in my laboratory.\n\n00:09:08.357 --> 00:09:11.100\nIt took us 10 years of hard work\n\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.551\nto reach this goal.\n\n00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:16.102\nBut the remaining question was, how?\n\n00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:17.794\nI mean, how is it possible?\n\n00:09:17.794 --> 00:09:19.472\nAnd here, what we found\n\n00:09:19.472 --> 00:09:23.148\nwas completely unexpected.\n\n00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:27.306\nThis novel training paradigm\n\n00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:30.977\nencouraged the brain to create new connections,\n\n00:09:30.977 --> 00:09:33.879\nsome relay circuits\n\n00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:36.927\nthat relay information from the brain\n\n00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:40.083\npast the injury and restore cortical control\n\n00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:43.524\nover the locomotor networks below the injury.\n\n00:09:43.524 --> 00:09:46.446\nAnd here, you can see one such example,\n\n00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:49.809\nwhere we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.\n\n00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:53.229\nThis blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,\n\n00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:55.592\nand what this constellation\n\n00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:57.943\nof synaptic contacts means\n\n00:09:57.943 --> 00:10:01.742\nis that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center\n\n00:10:01.742 --> 00:10:05.740\nwith only one relay neuron.\n\n00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.671\nBut the remodeling was not restricted\n\n00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:08.758\nto the lesion area.\n\n00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:12.047\nIt occurred throughout the central nervous system,\n\n00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:14.365\nincluding in the brain stem,\n\n00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:17.627\nwhere we observed up to 300-percent increase\n\n00:10:17.627 --> 00:10:21.386\nin the density of fibers coming from the brain.\n\n00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:24.913\nWe did not aim to repair the spinal cord,\n\n00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:27.510\nyet we were able to promote\n\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.667\none of the more extensive remodeling\n\n00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:32.136\nof axonal projections ever observed\n\n00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.397\nin the central nervous system of adult mammal\n\n00:10:34.397 --> 00:10:36.942\nafter an injury.\n\n00:10:36.942 --> 00:10:42.011\nAnd there is a very important message\n\n00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:46.454\nhidden behind this discovery.\n\n00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:49.676\nThey are the result of a young team\n\n00:10:49.676 --> 00:10:52.068\nof very talented people:\n\n00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:56.526\nphysical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,\n\n00:10:56.526 --> 00:10:58.725\nengineers of all kinds,\n\n00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.516\nwho have achieved together\n\n00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:04.159\nwhat would have been impossible by single individuals.\n\n00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:07.242\nThis is truly a trans-disciplinary team.\n\n00:11:07.242 --> 00:11:09.430\nThey are working so close to each other\n\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.621\nthat there is horizontal transfer of DNA.\n\n00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:14.244\nWe are creating the next generation\n\n00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:16.485\nof M.D.'s and engineers\n\n00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:18.929\ncapable of translating discoveries all the way\n\n00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:21.601\nfrom bench to bedside.\n\n00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.607\nAnd me?\n\n00:11:23.607 --> 00:11:28.154\nI am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.\n\n00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:34.957\nNow, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,\n\n00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:38.721\nwill this help injured people?\n\n00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:42.613\nMe too, every day.\n\n00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:46.026\nThe truth is that we don't know enough yet.\n\n00:11:46.026 --> 00:11:50.250\nThis is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,\n\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.984\nbut I begin to believe that this may lead\n\n00:11:52.984 --> 00:11:55.551\nto an intervention to improve recovery\n\n00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:58.738\nand people's quality of life.\n\n00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:01.227\nI would like you all\n\n00:12:01.227 --> 00:12:04.854\nto take a moment and dream with me.\n\n00:12:04.854 --> 00:12:10.749\nImagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.\n\n00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:13.904\nAfter a few weeks of recovery,\n\n00:12:13.904 --> 00:12:16.264\nwe will implant a programmable pump\n\n00:12:16.264 --> 00:12:19.297\nto deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail\n\n00:12:19.297 --> 00:12:21.739\ndirectly to the spinal cord.\n\n00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:25.002\nAt the same time, we will implant an electrode array,\n\n00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:27.109\na sort of second skin\n\n00:12:27.109 --> 00:12:30.669\ncovering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,\n\n00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:33.935\nand this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator\n\n00:12:33.935 --> 00:12:36.397\nthat delivers stimulations that are tailored\n\n00:12:36.397 --> 00:12:38.583\nto the person's needs.\n\n00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:43.441\nThis defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis\n\n00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:46.192\nthat will enable locomotion\n\n00:12:46.192 --> 00:12:50.239\nduring training with a newly designed supporting system.\n\n00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:53.522\nAnd my hope is that after several months of training,\n\n00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:55.685\nthere may be enough remodeling of residual connection\n\n00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:59.354\nto allow locomotion without the robot,\n\n00:12:59.354 --> 00:13:03.132\nmaybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.\n\n00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.666\nMy hope here is to be able to create\n\n00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:07.931\nthe personalized condition\n\n00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.594\nto boost the plasticity of the brain\n\n00:13:10.594 --> 00:13:12.125\nand the spinal cord.\n\n00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.864\nAnd this is a radically new concept\n\n00:13:14.864 --> 00:13:18.157\nthat may apply to other neurological disorders,\n\n00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:22.695\nwhat I termed \"personalized neuroprosthetics,\"\n\n00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:25.719\nwhere by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,\n\n00:13:25.719 --> 00:13:29.433\nI implanted throughout the nervous system,\n\n00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.774\nin the brain, in the

phone. They've changed the world. However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world.We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6. Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world.And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. (Laughter) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined.And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And it's a pretty big building. How big? Well, I can give you the numbers \u2014 140,000 square meters \u2014 but that doesn't really tell you very much. Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store? Right? It's pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone.Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner. In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.(Laughter)Right?So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications. I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent.So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here. And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didn't know this was happening. Now we know for a fact it's happening. We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM. We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. We didn't know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter \u2014 all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do.And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years. So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result. A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic. That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control.So what do we actually know about the leaks? Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on.And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation? And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating. Instead, they've been hacked. That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked. In this case, they've been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government. And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual. Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, \"Success,\" when they gain access to services like this. What the hell?And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe that's true. Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example. Let's take, for example, Sweden. I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden, their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support? And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services? And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. It's not balanced by any means, not even close.And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States. Like, Skype used to be secure. It used to be end-to-end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today, it no longer is secure. So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome.And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. It's the war on terror. You shouldn't worry about it. Well, it's not the war on terror. Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right? It's not the war on terror. Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them? Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists? And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom? Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all?But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough.(Applause)Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this? What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something? And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either. Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use.(Applause)And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States.And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, \"If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy.\"That's what it's about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters.So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations \u2014 and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming.(Laughter)(Applause)So, what is there to be done? Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry. We should be angry, because this is wrong, and it's rude, and it should not be done. But that's not going to really change the situation. What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And that's much easier said than done. How do you do that? A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.But maybe you don't have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1861, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.084\nThe two most likely largest inventions\n\n00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.331\nof our generation\n\n00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:22.524\nare the Internet and the mobile phone.\n\n00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.659\nThey've changed the world.\n\n00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.174\nHowever, largely to our surprise,\n\n00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:32.572\nthey also turned out to be the perfect tools\n\n00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:35.722\nfor the surveillance state.\n\n00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.619\nIt turned out that the capability\n\n00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:42.663\nto collect data, information and connections\n\n00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:46.881\nabout basically any of us and all of us\n\n00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.694\nis exactly what we've been hearing\n\n00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.301\nthroughout of the summer\nthrough revelations and leaks\n\n00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.392\nabout Western intelligence agencies,\n\n00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:59.418\nmostly U.S. intelligence agencies,\n\n00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:02.591\nwatching over the rest of the world.\n\n00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:05.789\nWe've heard about these starting with the\n\n00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.475\nrevelations from June 6.\n\n00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:12.544\nEdward Snowden started leaking information,\n\n00:01:12.544 --> 00:01:14.848\ntop secret classified information,\n\n00:01:14.848 --> 00:01:16.315\nfrom the U.S. intelligence agencies,\n\n00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:18.784\nand we started learning about things like PRISM\n\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:22.051\nand XKeyscore and others.\n\n00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:25.156\nAnd these are examples of the kinds of programs\n\n00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:29.435\nU.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,\n\n00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.951\nagainst the whole rest of the world.\n\n00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:36.659\nAnd if you look back about the forecasts\n\n00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.760\non surveillance by George Orwell,\n\n00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.893\nwell it turns out that\n\n00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:45.397\nGeorge Orwell was an optimist.\n\n00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.877\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.577\nWe are right now seeing a much larger scale\n\n00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.475\nof tracking of individual citizens\n\n00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:56.107\nthan he could have ever imagined.\n\n00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:59.642\nAnd this here is the infamous\n\n00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:03.486\nNSA data center in Utah.\n\n00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:06.642\nDue to be opened very soon,\n\n00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:09.433\nit will be both a supercomputing center\n\n00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.570\nand a data storage center.\n\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.463\nYou could basically imagine it has a large hall\n\n00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.919\nfilled with hard drives storing data\n\n00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.193\nthey are collecting.\n\n00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:21.350\nAnd it's a pretty big building.\n\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.201\nHow big?

Don't let anybody tell you\n\n00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:13.541\nthat we knew this already,\nbecause we did not know this already.\n\n00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.314\nOur worst fears might have been something like this,\n\n00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:19.265\nbut we didn't know this was happening.\n\n00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:22.042\nNow we know for a fact it's happening.\n\n00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.621\nWe didn't know about this.\nWe didn't know about PRISM.\n\n00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:27.527\nWe didn't know about XKeyscore.\nWe didn't know about Cybertrans.\n\n00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.477\nWe didn't know about DoubleArrow.\n\n00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.625\nWe did not know about Skywriter --\n\n00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:33.320\nall these different programs\n\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.561\nrun by U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:39.590\nBut now we do.\n\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.756\nAnd we did not know\n\n00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:44.831\nthat U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes\n\n00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.668\nsuch as infiltrating standardization bodies\n\n00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:53.416\nto sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.\n\n00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.453\nAnd what that means\n\n00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:57.273\nis that you take something which is secure,\n\n00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.694\nan encryption algorithm which is so secure\n\n00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:02.801\nthat if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,\n\n00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:04.543\nnobody can decrypt that file.\n\n00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:08.956\nEven if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,\n\n00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:11.016\nit's going to take millions of years.\n\n00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:13.263\nSo that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.\n\n00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:15.337\nYou take something which is that good\n\n00:06:15.337 --> 00:06:17.821\nand then you weaken it on purpose,\n\n00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:23.431\nmaking all of us less secure as an end result.\n\n00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:25.562\nA real-world equivalent would be that\n\n00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:28.214\nintelligence agencies would force\n\n00:06:28.214 --> 00:06:31.041\nsome secret pin code into every single house alarm\n\n00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.834\nso they could get into every single house\n\n00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.080\nbecause, you know, bad people\nmight have house alarms,\n\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.519\nbut it will also make all of us\n\n00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.748\nless secure as an end result.\n\n00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:43.488\nBackdooring encryption algorithms\n\n00:06:43.488 --> 00:06:46.584\njust boggles the mind.\n\n00:06:46.584 --> 00:06:50.359\nBut of course, these intelligence agencies\nare doing their job.\n\n00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.116\nThis is what they have been told to do:\n\n00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:54.346\ndo signals intelligence,\n\n00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:56.358\nmonitor telecommunications,\n\n00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:57.780\nmonitor Internet traffic.\n\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.488\nThat's what they're trying to do,\n\n00:06:59.488 --> 00:07:02.570\nand since most, a very big part\nof the Internet traffic today is encrypted,\n\n00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.527\nthey're trying to find ways around the encryption.\n\n00:07:04.527 --> 00:07:07.584\nOne way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,\n\n00:07:07.584 --> 00:07:09.469\nwhich is a great example\n\n00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.690\nabout how U.S. intelligence agencies\n\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.439\nare running loose.\n\n00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.280\nThey are completely out of control,\n\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.722\nand they should be brought back under control.\n\n00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:24.537\nSo what do we actually know about the leaks?\n\n00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:26.647\nEverything is based on the files\n\n00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:29.145\nleaked by Mr. Snowden.\n\n00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:31.993\nThe very first PRISM slides\n\n00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.982\nfrom the beginning of June\n\n00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:36.076\ndetail a collection program where the data\n\n00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:37.862\nis collected from service providers,\n\n00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:40.740\nand they actually go and name the service providers\n\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.071\nthey have access to.\n\n00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:45.013\nThey even have a specific date\n\n00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:47.677\non when the collection of data began\n\n00:07:47.677 --> 00:07:49.316\nfor each of the service providers.\n\n00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:51.603\nSo for example, they name\nthe collection from Microsoft\n\n00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:55.323\nstarted on September 11, 2007,\n\n00:07:55.323 --> 00:07:58.055\nfor Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,\n\n00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:01.071\nand then others: Google, Facebook,\n\n00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.315\nSkype, Apple and so on.\n\n00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:07.163\nAnd every single one of these companies denies.\n\n00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:11.558\nThey all say that this simply isn't true,\n\n00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:16.166\nthat they are not giving\nbackdoor access to their data.\n\n00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:20.289\nYet we have these files.\n\n00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.610\nSo is one of the parties lying,\n\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.933\nor is there some other alternative explanation?\n\n00:08:25.933 --> 00:08:28.855\nAnd one explanation would be\n\n00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.742\nthat these parties, these service providers,\n\n00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:33.658\nare not cooperating.\n\n00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.679\nInstead, they've been hacked.\n\n00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.896\nThat would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.\n\n00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:44.074\nIn this case, they've been hacked\nby their own government.\n\n00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:46.495\nThat might sound outlandish,\n\n00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:48.709\nbut we already have cases where this has happened,\n\n00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:51.755\nfor example, the case of the Flame malware\n\n00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.788\nwhich we strongly believe was authored\n\n00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:55.685\nby the U.S. government,\n\n00:08:55.685 --> 00:08:59.584\nand which, to spread, subverted the security\n\n00:08:59.584 --> 00:09:02.470\nof the Windows Update network,\n\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.563\nmeaning here, the company was hacked\n\n00:09:06.563 --> 00:09:08.921\nby their own government.\n\n00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:10.520\nAnd there's more evidence\n\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.071\nsupporting this theory as well.\n\n00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:17.076\nDer Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information\n\n00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:21.341\nabout the operations run by the elite hacker units\n\n00:09:21.341 --> 00:09:24.376\noperating inside these intelligence agencies.\n\n00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:27.002\nInside NSA, the unit is called TAO,\n\n00:09:27.002 --> 00:09:28.847\nTailored Access Operations,\n\n00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:32.411\nand inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,\n\n00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:36.410\nit's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.\n\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.254\nAnd these recent leaks of these three slides\n\n00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.458\ndetail an operation\n\n00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.616\nrun by this GCHQ intelligence agency\n\n00:09:45.616 --> 00:09:47.425\nfrom the United Kingdom\n\n00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:51.658\ntargeting a telecom here in Belgium.\n\n00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:53.934\nAnd what this really means\n\n00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:57.822\nis that an E.U. country's intelligence agency\n\n00:09:57.822 --> 00:10:00.037\nis breaching the security\n\n00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:04.850\nof a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,\n\n00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.685\nand they discuss it in their slides completely casually,\n\n00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:10.286\nbusiness as usual.\n\n00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.954\nHere's the primary target,\n\n00:10:11.954 --> 00:10:13.332\nhere's the secondary target,\n\n00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:14.756\nhere's the teaming.\n\n00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:18.612\nThey probably have a team building\non Thursday evening in a pub.\n\n00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:21.653\nThey even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art\n\n00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:23.360\nlike, you know, \"Success,\"\n\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.624\nwhen they gain access to services like this.\n\n00:10:26.624 --> 00:10:29.450\nWhat the hell?\n\n00:10:31.643 --> 00:10:33.476\nAnd then there's the argument\n\n00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:35.136\nthat okay, yes, this might be going on,\n\n00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.773\nbut then again, other countries are doing it as well.\n\n00:10:37.773 --> 00:10:40.196\nAll countries spy.\n\n00:10:40.196 --> 00:10:41.934\nAnd maybe that's true.\n\n00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:44.372\nMany countries spy, not all of them,\nbut let's take an example.\n\n00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:46.483\nLet's take, for example, Sweden.\n\n00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:47.859\nI'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden\n\n00:10:47.859 --> 00:10:50.138\nhas a little bit of a similar law to the United States.\n\n00:10:50.138 --> 00:10:52.261\nWhen your data traffic goes through Sweden,\n\n00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:55.071\ntheir intelligence agency has a legal right by the law\n\n00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.072\nto intercept that traffic.\n\n00:10:57.072 --> 00:11:00.277\nAll right, how many Swedish decisionmakers\n\n00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:03.149\nand politicians and business leaders\n\n00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:06.222\nuse, every day, U.S.-based services,\n\n00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:09.490\nlike, you know, run Windows or OSX,\n\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.700\nor use Facebook or LinkedIn,\n\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.100\nor store their data in clouds like iCloud\n\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.994\nor Skydrive or DropBox,\n\n00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:23.297\nor maybe use online services like\nAmazon web services or sales support?\n\n00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:27.254\nAnd the answer is, every single Swedish\nbusiness leader does that every single day.\n\n00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:28.853\nAnd then we turn it around.\n\n00:11:28.853 --> 00:11:30.758\nHow many American leaders\n\n00:11:30.758 --> 00:11:35.051\nuse Swedish webmails and cloud services?\n\n00:11:35.051 --> 00:11:37.091\nAnd the answer is zero.\n\n00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:39.360\nSo this is not balanced.\n\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.985\nIt's not balanced by any means, not even close.\n\n00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:46.426\nAnd when we do have the occasional\n\n00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.427\nEuropean success story,\n\n00:11:48.427 --> 00:11:51.993\neven those, then, typically end up being sold\nto the United States.\n\n00:11:51.993 --> 00:11:54.257\nLike, Skype used to be secure.\n\n00:11:54.257 --> 00:11:56.990\nIt used to be end-to-end encrypted.\n\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.031\nThen it was sold to the United States.\n\n00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:01.680\nToday, it no longer is secure.\n\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.901\nSo once again, we take something which is secure\n\n00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:06.771\nand then we make it less secure on purpose,\n\n00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:11.255\nmaking all of us less secure as an outcome.\n\n00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:15.060\nAnd then the argument that the United States\n\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.078\nis only fighting terrorists.\n\n00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:18.244\nIt's the war on terror.\n\n00:12:18.244 --> 00:12:20.791\nYou shouldn't worry about it.\n\n00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:23.021\nWell, it's not the war on terror.\n\n00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:25.194\nYes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,\n\n00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:28.170\nthere are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,\n\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.721\nand we should fight them,\n\n00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:31.327\nbut we know through these leaks\n\n00:12:31.327 --> 00:12:33.909\nthat they have used the same techniques\n\n00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:37.245\nto listen to phone calls of European leaders,\n\n00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:40.700\nto tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,\n\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.506\nto read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,\n\n00:12:45.506 --> 00:12:48.660\nand I don't think they are trying to find terrorists\n\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.678\nfrom inside the E.U. Parliament, right?\n\n00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:53.626\nIt's not the war on terror.\n\n00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:57.768\nPart of it might be, and there are terrorists,\n\n00:12:57.768 --> 00:13:00.195\nbut are we really thinking about terrorists\n\n00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:02.364\nas such an existential threat\n\n00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:06.040\nthat we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?\n\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.531\nAre the Americans ready\nto throw away the Constituion\n\n00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:13.772\nand throw it in the trash\njust because there are terrorists?\n\n00:13:13.772 --> 00:13:16.296\nAnd the same thing with the Bill of Rights\nand all the amendments\n\n00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.613\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:23.764\nand the E.U. conventions on human rights\nand fundamental freedoms\n\n00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:25.281\nand the press freedom?\n\n00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:29.096\nDo we really think terrorism\nis such an existential threat,\n\n00:13:29.096 --> 00:13:32.222\nwe are ready to do anything at all?\n\n00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:37.112\nBut people are scared about terrorists,\n\n00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:39.526\nand then they think that\nmaybe that surveillance is okay\n\n00:13:39.526 --> 00:13:41.570\nbecause they have nothing to hide.\n\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.277\nFeel free to survey me if that helps.\n\n00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:47.165\nAnd whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide\n\n00:13:47.165 --> 00:13:51.878\nsimply hasn't thought about this long enough.\n\n00:13:54.478 --> 00:14:00.343\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:00.343 --> 00:14:03.115\nBecause we have this thing called privacy,\n\n00:14:03.115 --> 00:14:05.460\nand if you really think that you have nothing to hide,\n\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.676\nplease make sure that's the first thing you tell me,\n\n00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:09.226\nbecause then I know\n\n00:14:09.226 --> 00:14:10.866\nthat I should not trust you with any secrets,\n\n00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:14.164\nbecause obviously you can't keep a secret.\n\n00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.852\nBut people are brutally honest with the Internet,\n\n00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:23.548\nand when these leaks started,\n\n00:14:23.548 --> 00:14:25.426\nmany people were asking me about this.\n\n00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:27.000\nAnd I have nothing to hide.\n\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.290\nI'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.\n\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.075\nYet, I have nothing that I would in particular\n\n00:14:33.075 --> 00:14:35.868\nlike to share with an intelligence agency,\n\n00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:40.005\nespecially a foreign intelligence agency.\n\n00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.860\nAnd if we indeed need a Big Brother,\n\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.338\nI would much rather have a domestic Big Brother\n\n00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:49.498\nthan a foreign Big Brother.\n\n00:14:49.503 --> 00:14:54.562\nAnd when the leaks started,\nthe very first thing I tweeted about this\n\n00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:56.636\nwas a comment about how,\n\n00:14:56.636 --> 00:14:58.324\nwhen you've been using search engines,\n\n00:14:58.324 --> 00:15:01.973\nyou've been potentially leaking all that\nto U.S. intelligence.\n\n00:15:01.973 --> 00:15:03.945\nAnd two minutes later, I got a reply\n\n00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.281\nby somebody called Kimberly from the United States\n\n00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.448\nchallenging me, like, why am I worried about this?\n\n00:15:08.461 --> 00:15:12.493\nWhat am I sending to worry about this?\nAm I sending naked pictures or something?\n\n00:15:12.493 --> 00:15:14.461\nAnd my answer to Kimberly was\n\n00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:17.490\nthat what I'm sending is none of your business,\n\n00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.755\nand it should be none\nof your government's business either.\n\n00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.007\nBecause that's what it's about.

Essentially, for three reasons: calculation, application, and last, and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it, inspiration.Mathematics is the science of patterns, and we study it to learn how to think logically, critically and creatively, but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated, and when our students ask, \"Why are we learning this?\" then they often hear that they'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. But wouldn't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind? Now, I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen, so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers, the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here. That's great.Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways. From the standpoint of calculation, they're as easy to understand as one plus one, which is two. Then one plus two is three, two plus three is five, three plus five is eight, and so on. Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa, and these numbers appear in his book \"Liber Abaci,\" which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. In terms of applications, Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often. The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number, or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well.In fact, there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers, but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display. Let me show you one of my favorites. Suppose you like to square numbers, and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)Let's look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. So one squared is one, two squared is four, three squared is nine, five squared is 25, and so on. Now, it's no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers, you get the next Fibonacci number. Right? That's how they're created. But you wouldn't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together. But check this out. One plus one gives us two, and one plus four gives us five. And four plus nine is 13, nine plus 25 is 34, and yes, the pattern continues.In fact, here's another one. Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. Let's see what we get there. So one plus one plus four is six. Add nine to that, we get 15. Add 25, we get 40. Add 64, we get 104. Now look at those numbers. Those are not Fibonacci numbers, but if you look at them closely, you'll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them.Do you see it? I'll show it to you. Six is two times three, 15 is three times five, 40 is five times eight, two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?(Laughter)Fibonacci! Of course.Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns, it's even more satisfying to understand why they are true. Let's look at that last equation. Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13? I'll show you by drawing a simple picture. We'll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square. Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle. Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square, and next to that, a three-by-three square, beneath that, a five-by-five square, and then an eight-by-eight square, creating one giant rectangle, right?Now let me ask you a simple question: what is the area of the rectangle? Well, on the one hand, it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it, right? Just as we created it. It's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared. Right? That's the area. On the other hand, because it's a rectangle, the area is equal to its height times its base, and the height is clearly eight, and the base is five plus eight, which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right? So the area is also eight times 13. Since we've correctly calculated the area two different ways, they have to be the same number, and that's why the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13.Now, if we continue this process, we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21, 21 by 34, and so on.Now check this out. If you divide 13 by eight, you get 1.625. And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number, then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618, known to many people as the Golden Ratio, a number which has fascinated mathematicians, scientists and artists for centuries.Now, I show all this to you because, like so much of mathematics, there's a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools. We spend lots of time learning about calculation, but let's not forget about application, including, perhaps, the most important application of all, learning how to think.If I could summarize this in one sentence, it would be this: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1862, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.610\nSo why do we learn mathematics?\n\n00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.158\nEssentially, for three reasons:\n\n00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:19.786\ncalculation,\n\n00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.686\napplication,\n\n00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:24.373\nand last, and unfortunately least\n\n00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:26.478\nin terms of the time we give it,\n\n00:00:26.478 --> 00:00:28.400\ninspiration.\n\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.672\nMathematics is the science of patterns,\n\n00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:34.030\nand we study it to learn how to think logically,\n\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.557\ncritically and creatively,\n\n00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:39.483\nbut too much of the mathematics\nthat we learn in school\n\n00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:41.802\nis not effectively motivated,\n\n00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.227\nand when our students ask,\n\n00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:44.902\n\"Why are we learning this?\"\n\n00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:46.863\nthen they often hear that they'll need it\n\n00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:50.128\nin an upcoming math class or on a future test.\n\n00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:51.930\nBut wouldn't it be great\n\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.448\nif every once in a while we did mathematics\n\n00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:57.397\nsimply because it was fun or beautiful\n\n00:00:57.397 --> 00:00:59.487\nor because it excited the mind?\n\n00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.209\nNow, I know many people have not\n\n00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:03.528\nhad the opportunity to see how this can happen,\n\n00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.357\nso let me give you a quick example\n\n00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.698\nwith my favorite collection of numbers,\n\n00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:10.426\nthe Fibonacci numbers.

At the time, these words were earmarked and targeted against the British, but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody what many Westerners believe, that freedom is the most cherished value, and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them. Who could blame them? Over the past hundred years, the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development. In the United States over the past hundred years, incomes have increased 30 times, and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty. Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions, motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis, President Obama said, \"The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched.\" Thus, there's understandably a deep-seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth, liberal democracy, and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights.However, to many who live in the emerging markets, this is an illusion, and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was signed in 1948, was unanimously adopted, what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries, and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights. This schism has only grown wider. Today, many people who live in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives, believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point, and what is actually important is delivering on food, shelter, education and healthcare. \"Give me liberty or give me death\" is all well and good if you can afford it, but if you're living on less than one dollar a day, you're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy.Now, I know many people in this room and around the world will think, \"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,\" because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. But I ask you today, what would you do if you had to choose? What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote?Over the last 10 years, I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries, many of them in the emerging markets, in Latin America, Asia, and my own continent of Africa. I've met with presidents, dissidents, policymakers, lawyers, teachers, doctors and the man on the street, and through these conversations, it's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there's actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world.Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying people in the emerging markets don't understand democracy, nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders. Of course they would. However, I am saying that on balance, they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from, and how it is their governments can deliver for them, than whether or not the government was elected by democracy.The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics, and this is a system that is embodied by China. And rather than have private capitalism, they have state capitalism. Instead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system. And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights. I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow, because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they've come to this belief.First of all, it's China's economic performance over the past 30 years. She's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty, specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence. It's not just in economics, but it's also in terms of living standards. We see that in China, 28 percent of people had secondary school access. Today, it's closer to 82 percent. So in its totality, economic improvement has been quite significant.Second, China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. Today, the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world. They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems, one with private capitalism, another one broadly with state capitalism. However, these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient, which is a measure of income equality. Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China's income equality has been improving in recent times, whereas that of the United States has been declining.Thirdly, people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country \u2014 she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States \u2014 but even if you look to places like Africa, China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo, which is 9,000 miles, or three times the distance of New York to California. Now this is something that people can see and point to. Perhaps it's no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed, Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces. If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai, you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas. However, through a network of state-owned enterprises, the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas, using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise that around the world, people are pointing at what China is doing and saying, \"I like that. I want that. I want to be able to do what China's doing. That is the system that seems to work.\" I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. In particular, there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets, when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth. In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, not just China, have shown that actually, it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy. In a recent study, the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last. The study found that if your per capita income is about 1,000 dollars a year, your democracy will last about eight and a half years. If your per capita income is between 2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year, then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy. And only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water.What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable. But perhaps it's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy, because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies, democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace.The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing. Freedom House finds that although 50 percent of the world's countries today are democratic, 70 percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don't have free speech or freedom of movement. But also, we're finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years.What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy, is we've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way, and that has its roots in economics. But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world, something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016, that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen.What might that world look like? Well, the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism; greater protectionisms of nation-states; but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago, ever-declining political rights and individual rights.The question that is left for us in general is, what then should the West be doing? And I suggest that they have two options. The West can either compete or cooperate. If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model, and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy, this is basically going against headwinds, but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism. Now the fact of the matter is, if the West decides to compete, it will create a wider schism. The other option is for the West to cooperate, and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them.Now I'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China, and this is a way, in other words, for the West to take a back seat. But I put it to you that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential, they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete, and by that, they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want.The fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China, the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions. Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior, the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one. And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world, perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today. Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly 170 years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States. Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights. In fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law.At its very best, the Western model speaks for itself. It's the model that put food on the table. It's the refrigerators. It put a man on the moon. But the fact of the matter is, although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say, \"I want that, I like that,\" there's now a new person in town in the form of a country, China. Today, generations are looking at China and saying, \"China can produce infrastructure, China can produce economic growth, and we like that.\"Because ultimately, the question before us, and the question before seven billion people on the planet is, how can we create prosperity? People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way, to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time.As you leave here today, I would like to leave you with a very personal message, which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals, and this is really about being open-minded, open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world, creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people, has to be based in being open-minded, because these systems have good things and they have bad things.Just to illustrate, I went into my annals of myself. That's a picture of me.Awww. (Laughter)I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969. At the time of my birth, blacks were not issued birth certificates, and that law only changed in 1973. This is an affidavit from the Zambian government. I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years, I've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views. In this vein, we can increase economic growth. We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty. But also, it's going to require that we look at our assumptions, assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with around democracy, around private capitalism, around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms. We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth. Ultimately, it's about transforming the world and making it a better place.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1842, "subtitle":

emerging markets\n\n00:03:52.305 --> 00:03:55.514\nbelieve that there's actually a split occurring\n\n00:03:55.514 --> 00:03:58.280\nbetween what people believe ideologically\n\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.966\nin terms of politics and economics in the West\n\n00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:03.850\nand that which people believe in the rest of the world.\n\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.721\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:07.181\nI'm not saying people in the emerging markets\n\n00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:09.272\ndon't understand democracy,\n\n00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:11.181\nnor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally\n\n00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:13.666\nlike to pick their presidents or their leaders.\n\n00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:15.221\nOf course they would.\n\n00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.242\nHowever, I am saying that on balance,\n\n00:04:18.242 --> 00:04:19.824\nthey worry more about\n\n00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:22.855\nwhere their living standard improvements are going to come from,\n\n00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:25.138\nand how it is their governments can deliver for them,\n\n00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:27.043\nthan whether or not the government\n\n00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:29.983\nwas elected by democracy.\n\n00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:32.072\nThe fact of the matter\n\n00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:34.537\nis that this has become a very poignant question\n\n00:04:34.537 --> 00:04:36.870\nbecause there is for the first time in a long time\n\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.440\na real challenge to the Western ideological systems\n\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.594\nof politics and

capitalism.\n\n00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:53.917\nInstead of liberal democracy,\nthey have de-prioritized the democratic system.\n\n00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:56.281\nAnd they have also decided to prioritize\n\n00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:59.938\neconomic rights over political rights.\n\n00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:02.787\nI put it to you today that it is this system\n\n00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:04.632\nthat is embodied by China\n\n00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:06.592\nthat is gathering momentum amongst people\n\n00:05:06.592 --> 00:05:09.680\nin the emerging markets as the system to follow,\n\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.700\nbecause they believe increasingly\n\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.375\nthat it is the system\n\n00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.776\nthat will promise the best and fastest improvements\n\n00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:20.387\nin living standards in the shortest period of time.\n\n00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.966\nIf you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments\n\n00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:24.788\nexplaining to you first\n\n00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:28.818\nwhy economically they've come to this belief.\n\n00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:31.644\nFirst of all, it's China's economic performance\n\n00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:33.686\nover the past 30 years.\n\n00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:36.406\nShe's been able to produce record economic growth\n\n00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:40.041\nand meaningfully move many people out of poverty,\n\n00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.220\nspecifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty\n\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.034\nby moving over 300 million people\n\n00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:49.292\nout of indigence.\n\n00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:51.806\nIt's not just in economics,\n\n00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:54.303\nbut it's also in terms of living standards.\n\n00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.147\nWe see that in China, 28 percent of people\n\n00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:58.970\nhad secondary school access.\n\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.347\nToday, it's closer to 82 percent.\n\n00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.942\nSo in its totality, economic improvement\n\n00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:06.638\nhas been quite significant.\n\n00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:09.674\nSecond, China has been able\n\n00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:12.810\nto meaningfully improve its income inequality\n\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.475\nwithout changing the political construct.\n\n00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.905\nToday, the United States and China\n\n00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:20.431\nare the two leading economies in the world.\n\n00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:22.680\nThey have vastly different political systems\n\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.002\nand different economic systems,\n\n00:06:25.002 --> 00:06:26.472\none with private capitalism,\n\n00:06:26.472 --> 00:06:28.911\nanother one broadly with state capitalism.\n\n00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.984\nHowever, these two countries\n\n00:06:30.984 --> 00:06:33.091\nhave the identical GINI Coefficient,\n\n00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:35.638\nwhich is a measure of income equality.\n\n00:06:35.638 --> 00:06:37.870\nPerhaps what is more disturbing\n\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.964\nis that China's income equality\n\n00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:42.285\nhas been improving in recent times,\n\n00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:43.902\nwhereas that of the United States\n\n00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.965\nhas been declining.\n\n00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:49.521\nThirdly, people in the emerging markets\n\n00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.915\nlook at China's amazing and legendary\n\n00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:54.241\ninfrastructure rollout.\n\n00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:55.900\nThis is not just about China\n\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.260\nbuilding roads and ports and railways\n\n00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.696\nin her own country --\n\n00:06:59.696 --> 00:07:02.784\nshe's been

00:07:10.134\nbut even if you look to places like Africa,\n\n00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:13.191\nChina has been able to help tar the distance\n\n00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:14.845\nof Cape Town to Cairo,\n\n00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:16.470\nwhich is 9,000 miles,\n\n00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.381\nor three times the distance of New York to California.\n\n00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:24.821\nNow this is something that people can see and point to.\n\n00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:26.503\nPerhaps it's no surprise\n\n00:07:26.503 --> 00:07:30.224\nthat in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,\n\n00:07:30.224 --> 00:07:32.092\nAfricans in 10 countries said\n\n00:07:32.092 --> 00:07:33.760\nthey thought that the Chinese were doing\n\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.654\namazing things to improve their livelihoods\n\n00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:40.152\nby wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.\n\n00:07:40.152 --> 00:07:44.672\nFinally, China is also providing innovative solutions\n\n00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:48.043\nto age-old social problems that the world faces.\n\n00:07:48.043 --> 00:07:51.311\nIf you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,\n\n00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:54.563\nyou find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics\n\n00:07:54.563 --> 00:07:56.790\ncontinue to be a stumbling block\n\n00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.891\nto the delivery of medicine and healthcare\n\n00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:00.761\nin the rural areas.\n\n00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:03.639\nHowever, through a network of state-owned enterprises,\n\n00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:06.535\nthe Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,\n\n00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:08.025\nusing their companies\n\n00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:11.297\nto help deliver on these healthcare solutions.\n\n00:08:11.297 --> 00:08:13.503\nLadies and gentlemen, it's no surprise\n\n00:08:13.503 --> 00:08:16.753\nthat around the world, people are pointing\nat what China is doing and saying,\n\n00:08:16.753 --> 00:08:18.895\n\"I like that. I want that.\n\n00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:21.089\nI want to be able to do what China's doing.\n\n00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:23.859\nThat is the system that seems to work.\"\n\n00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:25.532\nI'm here to also tell you\n\n00:08:25.532 --> 00:08:27.279\nthat there are lots of shifts occurring\n\n00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.239\naround what China is doing\n\n00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.314\nin the democratic stance.\n\n00:08:31.314 --> 00:08:33.979\nIn particular, there is growing doubt\n\n00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:36.081\namong people in the emerging markets,\n\n00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.788\nwhen people now believe that democracy\n\n00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:40.072\nis no longer to be viewed\n\n00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:43.555\nas a prerequisite for economic growth.\n\n00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:47.796\nIn fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,\n\n00:08:47.796 --> 00:08:50.704\nnot just China, have shown that actually,\n\n00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:53.390\nit's economic growth that is a prerequisite\n\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.154\nfor democracy.\n\n00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:58.400\nIn a recent study, the evidence has shown\n\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.898\nthat income is the greatest determinant\n\n00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:03.646\nof how long a democracy can last.\n\n00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:06.379\nThe study found that if your per capita income\n\n00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.591\nis about 1,000 dollars a year,\n\n00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:11.589\nyour democracy will last about eight and a half years.\n\n00:09:11.589 --> 00:09:13.307\nIf your per capita income is between\n\n00:09:13.307 --> 00:09:15.707\n2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,\n\n00:09:15.707 --> 00:09:18.749\nthen you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.\n\n00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:20.573\nAnd only if your per capita income\n\n00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:22.704\nis above 6,000 dollars a year\n\n00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:26.448\nwill you have democracy come hell or high water.\n\n00:09:26.448 --> 00:09:28.160\nWhat this is telling us\n\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.733\nis that we need to first establish a middle class\n\n00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:33.850\nthat is able to hold the government accountable.\n\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.225\nBut perhaps it's also telling us\n\n00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:37.807\nthat we should be worried about going\n\n00:09:37.807 --> 00:09:40.717\naround the world and shoehorning democracy,\n\n00:09:40.717 --> 00:09:42.527\nbecause ultimately we run the risk\n\n00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:44.657\nof ending up with illiberal democracies,\n\n00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:46.718\ndemocracies that in some sense\n\n00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:48.885\ncould be worse than the authoritarian governments\n\n00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:52.572\nthat they seek to replace.\n\n00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:54.838\nThe evidence around illiberal democracies\n\n00:09:54.838 --> 00:09:56.658\nis quite depressing.\n\n00:09:56.658 --> 00:09:59.104\nFreedom House finds that although 50 percent\n\n00:09:59.104 --> 00:10:02.261\nof the world's countries today are democratic,\n\n00:10:02.261 --> 00:10:04.967\n70 percent of those countries are illiberal\n\n00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:07.320\nin the sense that people don't have free speech\n\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.065\nor freedom of movement.\n\n00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:12.384\nBut also, we're finding from Freedom House\n\n00:10:12.384 --> 00:10:14.505\nin a study that they published last year\n\n00:10:14.505 --> 00:10:16.620\nthat freedom has been on the decline\n\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.192\nevery year for the past seven years.\n\n00:10:19.192 --> 00:10:20.976\nWhat this says\n\n00:10:20.976 --> 00:10:22.314\nis that for people like me\n\n00:10:22.314 --> 00:10:24.924\nwho care about liberal democracy,\n\n00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:27.271\nis we've got to find a more sustainable way\n\n00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:29.616\nof ensuring that we have a sustainable form\n\n00:10:29.616 --> 00:10:31.817\nof democracy in a liberal way,\n\n00:10:31.817 --> 00:10:34.817\nand that has its roots in economics.\n\n00:10:34.817 --> 00:10:37.746\nBut it also says that as China moves\n\n00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:40.278\ntoward being the largest economy in the world,\n\n00:10:40.278 --> 00:10:42.299\nsomething that is expected to happen\n\n00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:44.374\nby experts in 2016,\n\n00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:46.644\nthat this schism between the political\n\n00:10:46.644 --> 00:10:50.006\nand economic ideologies of the West and the rest\n\n00:10:50.006 --> 00:10:52.937\nis likely to widen.\n\n00:10:52.937 --> 00:10:55.492\nWhat might that world look like?\n\n00:10:55.492 --> 00:10:57.054\nWell, the world could look like\n\n00:10:57.054 --> 00:11:00.319\nmore state involvement and state capitalism;\n\n00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:03.158\ngreater protectionisms of nation-states;\n\n00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:05.667\nbut also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,\n\n00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:07.834\never-declining political rights\n\n00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.895\nand individual rights.\n\n00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:12.657\nThe question that is left for us in general\n\n00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:15.773\nis, what then should the West be doing?\n\n00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:18.478\nAnd I suggest that they have two options.\n\n00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:22.895\nThe West can either compete or cooperate.\n\n00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:26.083\nIf the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,\n\n00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:28.090\nand in effect go around the world\n\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.417\nand continue to try and push an agenda\n\n00:11:30.417 --> 00:11:33.457\nof private capitalism and liberal democracy,\n\n00:11:33.457 --> 00:11:36.113\nthis is basically going against headwinds,\n\n00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:38.137\nbut it also would be a natural stance\n\n00:11:38.137 --> 00:11:39.598\nfor the West to take\n\n00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.631\nbecause in many ways it is the antithesis\n\n00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:43.778\nof the Chinese model\n\n00:11:43.778 --> 00:11:47.906\nof de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.\n\n00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:49.685\nNow the fact of the matter is,\n\n00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:51.643\nif the West decides to compete,\n\n00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:55.041\nit will create a wider schism.\n\n00:11:55.041 --> 00:11:57.894\nThe other option is for the West to cooperate,\n\n00:11:57.894 --> 00:11:59.488\nand by cooperating I mean\n\n00:11:59.488 --> 00:12:02.998\ngiving the emerging market countries the flexibility\n\n00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:05.045\nto figure out in an organic way\n\n00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:06.807\nwhat political and economic system\n\n00:12:06.807 --> 00:12:08.500\nworks best for them.\n\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.230\nNow I'm sure some of you in the room\n\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.104\nwill be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,\n\n00:12:13.104 --> 00:12:15.175\nand this is a way, in other words,\n\n00:12:15.175 --> 00:12:17.087\nfor the West to take a back seat.\n\n00:12:17.087 --> 00:12:18.542\nBut I put it to you\n\n00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.892\nthat if the United States and European countries\n\n00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:23.543\nwant to remain globally influential,\n\n00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:25.413\nthey may have to consider cooperating\n\n00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:27.962\nin the short term in order to compete,\n\n00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:30.205\nand by that, they might have to focus\n\n00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:33.440\nmore aggressively on economic outcomes\n\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.149\nto help create the middle class\n\n00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:37.820\nand therefore be able to hold government accountable\n\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.847\nand create the democracies that we really want.\n\n00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:44.436\nThe fact of the matter is that\n\n00:12:44.436 --> 00:12:46.339\ninstead of going around the world\n\n00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:49.826\nand haranguing countries for engaging with China,\n\n00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:52.786\nthe West should be encouraging its own businesses\n\n00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:55.285\nto trade and invest in these regions.\n\n00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:59.537\nInstead of criticizing China for bad behavior,\n\n00:12:59.537 --> 00:13:02.137\nthe West should be showing how it is\n\n00:13:02.137 --> 00:13:04.524\nthat their own system of politics and economics\n\n00:13:04.524 --> 00:13:06.674\nis the superior one.\n\n00:13:06.674 --> 00:13:08.694\nAnd instead of shoehorning democracy\n\n00:13:08.694 --> 00:13:10.185\naround the world,\n\n00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:11.460\nperhaps the West should take a leaf\n\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.312\nout of its own history book\n\n00:13:13.312 --> 00:13:16.162\nand remember that it takes a lot of patience\n\n00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.732\nin order to develop the models\n\n00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:20.065\nand the systems that you have today.\n\n00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:23.537\nIndeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer\n\n00:13:23.537 --> 00:13:26.166\nreminds us that it took the United States\n\n00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:28.812\nnearly 170 years\n\n00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:31.481\nfrom the time that the Constitution was written\n\n00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:34.441\nfor there to be equal rights in the United States.\n\n00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:35.803\nSome people would argue that today\n\n00:13:35.803 --> 00:13:37.317\nthere is still no equal rights.\n\n00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.163\nIn fact, there are groups who would argue\n\n00:13:39.163 --> 00:13:44.491\nthat they still do not have equal rights under the law.\n\n00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.073\nAt its very best,\n\n00:13:46.073 --> 00:13:48.325\nthe Western model speaks for itself.\n\n00:13:48.325 --> 00:13:50.486\nIt's the model that put food on the table.\n\n00:13:50.486 --> 00:13:52.077\nIt's the refrigerators.\n\n00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.109\nIt put a man on the moon.\n\n00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:55.899\nBut the fact of the matter is,\n\n00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:57.549\nalthough people back in the day\n\n00:13:57.549 --> 00:13:59.615\nused to point at the Western countries and say,\n\n00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:01.658\n\"I want that, I like that,\"\n\n00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:03.817\nthere's now a new person in town\n\n00:14:03.817 --> 00:14:06.256\nin the form of a country, China.\n\n00:14:06.256 --> 00:14:08.342\nToday, generations are looking at China\n\n00:14:08.342 --> 00:14:10.982\nand saying, \"China can produce infrastructure,\n\n00:14:10.982 --> 00:14:13.098\nChina can produce economic growth,\n\n00:14:13.098 --> 00:14:14.666\nand we like that.\"\n\n00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.380\nBecause ultimately, the question before us,\n\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.236\nand the question before\n\n00:14:19.236 --> 00:14:20.941\nseven billion people on the planet\n\n00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:24.041\nis, how can we create prosperity?\n\n00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.956\nPeople who care and will pivot towards the

ensure\n\n00:14:32.513 --> 00:14:34.494\nthat they can have better living standards\n\n00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:37.117\nin the shortest period of time.\n\n00:14:37.117 --> 00:14:38.828\nAs you leave here today,\n\n00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:40.233\nI would like to leave you\n\n00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:41.886\nwith a very personal message,\n\n00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:43.972\nwhich is what it is that I believe\n\n00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:46.376\nwe should be doing as individuals,\n\n00:14:46.376 --> 00:14:49.745\nand this is really about being open-minded,\n\n00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:53.084\nopen-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams\n\n00:14:53.084 --> 00:14:56.319\nof creating prosperity for people around the world,\n\n00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:59.243\ncreating and meaningfully putting a dent

It was the winter of 2009, and I had been blind for about a year. Things were going pretty well. Safely reaching the other side, I turned to the left, pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal, and waited my turn. As it went off, I took off and safely got to the other side. Stepping onto the sidewalk, I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me. I know there's a cafe on the corner, and they have chairs out in front, so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street. As I did, so slid the chair. I just figured I'd made a mistake, and went back to the right, and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity. Now I was getting a little anxious. I went back to the left, and so slid the chair, blocking my path of travel. Now, I was officially freaking out. So I yelled, \"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?\" Just then, over my shout, I heard something else, a familiar rattle. It sounded familiar, and I quickly considered another possibility, and I reached out with my left hand, as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy, and I came across an ear, the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever. Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee, and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear. Who knows, maybe she was volunteering for service. (Laughter)But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight, seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you.So let me step back and set the stage a little bit. On St. Patrick's Day of 2008, I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor. The surgery was successful. Two days later, my sight started to fail. On the third day, it was gone.Immediately, I was struck by an incredible sense of fear, of confusion, of vulnerability, like anybody would. But as I had time to stop and think, I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for. In particular, I thought about my dad, who had passed away from complications from brain surgery. He was 36. I was seven at the time. So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead, and had no clue quite what was going to happen, I was alive. My son still had his dad. And besides, it's not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight. I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful, active life without sight.So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later, I left with a mission, a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life. Within six months, I had returned to work. My training had started. I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies, and was commuting to work on my own, walking through town and taking the bus. It was a lot of hard work.But what I didn't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time.From that came a lot of insights, or outsights, as I called them, things that I learned since losing my sight. These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound, from the mundane to the humorous. As an architect, that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself. Paramount amongst those was the realization that, actually, cities are fantastic places for the blind. And then I was also surprised by the city's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse. And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself. That was a little curious to me.Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind. Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses, things that you would otherwise maybe ignore. It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you. I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are, how you need to move, and where you need to go. Similarly, just through the grip of the cane, you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below, and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed. Similarly, just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space. But also, the sense of smell. Some districts and cities have their own smell, as do places and things around you, and if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you've been looking for.All this really surprised me, because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi-sensory than my sighted experience ever was. What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me. When you're sighted, everybody kind of sticks to themselves, you mind your own business. Lose your sight, though, and it's a whole other story. And I don't know who's watching who, but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me. And I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go, I'm getting all sorts of advice: Go here, move there, watch out for this. A lot of the information is good. Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed. You've got to figure out what they actually meant. Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful. But it's all good in the grand scheme of things.But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway, and came to a corner. I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal, and as it went off, I was just about to step out into the street, when all of a sudden, my right hand was just gripped by this guy, and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street, speaking to me in Mandarin. (Laughter) It's like, there was no escape from this man's death grip, but he got me safely there. What could I do? But believe me, there are more polite ways to offer assistance. We don't know you're there, so it's kind of nice to say \"Hello\" first. \"Would you like some help?\"But while in Oakland, I've really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight. I liked it sighted. It was fine. It's a perfectly great city. But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway, I was blessed every block of the way.\"Bless you, man.\"\"Go for it, brother.\"\"God bless you.\"I didn't get that sighted. (Laughter) And even without sight, I don't get that in San Francisco. And I know it bothers some of my blind friends, it's not just me. Often it's thought that that's an emotion that comes up out of pity. I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity, out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool. In fact, if I'm feeling down, I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland, I go for a walk, and I feel better like that, in no time at all.But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic, social, racial, economic lines. Disability is an equal-opportunity provider. Everybody's welcome. In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people: There are those with disabilities, and there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet. It's a different way of thinking about it, but I think it's kind of beautiful, because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled, and it's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life.So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind, but the city needs us. And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities, and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast. It's too late then. So if you design a city with the blind in mind, you'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level. If you design a city with the blind in mind, sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous. The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars. In fact, cars, who needs them? If you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter) They don't like it when you drive. (Laughter) If you design a city with the blind in mind, you design a city with a robust, accessible, well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around. If you design a city with the blind in mind, there'll be jobs, lots of jobs. Blind people want to work too. They want to earn a living.So, in designing a city for the blind, I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive, a more equitable, a more just city for all. And based on my prior sighted experience, it sounds like a pretty cool city, whether you're blind, whether you have a disability, or you haven't quite found yours yet.So thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1863, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:18.109\nSo, stepping down out of the bus,\n\n00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.854\nI headed back to the corner\n\n00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:23.242\nto head west en route to a braille training session.\n\n00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:25.352\nIt was the winter of 2009,\n\n00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:27.773\nand I had been blind for about a year.\n\n00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:29.906\nThings were going pretty well.\n\n00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:31.813\nSafely reaching the other side,\n\n00:00:31.813 --> 00:00:33.274\nI turned to the left,\n\n00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:35.878\npushed the auto-button for\nthe audible pedestrian signal,\n\n00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:37.802\nand waited my turn.\n\n00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.891\nAs it went off, I took off\n\n00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.564\nand safely got to the other side.\n\n00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:43.660\nStepping onto the sidewalk,\n\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.354\nI then heard the sound of a steel chair\n\n00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:50.510\nslide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.\n\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.427\nI know there's a cafe on the corner,\n\n00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.073\nand they have chairs out in front,\n\n00:00:54.073 --> 00:00:55.469\nso I just adjusted to the left\n\n00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.313\nto get closer to the street.\n\n00:00:57.313 --> 00:01:00.953\nAs I did, so slid the chair.\n\n00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:03.034\nI just figured I'd made a mistake,\n\n00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:04.872\nand went back to the right,\n\n00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:08.367\nand so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.\n\n00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.732\nNow I was getting a little anxious.\n\n00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:12.345\nI went back to the left,\n\n00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:13.634\nand so slid the chair,\n\n00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:16.242\nblocking my path of travel.\n\n00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.244\nNow, I was officially freaking out.\n\n00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:20.829\nSo I yelled,\n\n00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.090\n\"Who the hell's out there?

itself.\n\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.954\nThat was a little curious to me.\n\n00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:14.514\nLet me step back and take a look\n\n00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:19.876\nat why the city is so good for the blind.\n\n00:05:19.876 --> 00:05:23.498\nInherent with the training for recovery from sight loss\n\n00:05:23.498 --> 00:05:27.369\nis learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,\n\n00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.595\nthings that you would otherwise maybe ignore.\n\n00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:33.140\nIt's like a whole new world of sensory information\n\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.589\nopens up to you.\n\n00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.117\nI was really struck by the symphony\n\n00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:39.093\nof subtle sounds all around me in the city\n\n00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:40.385\nthat you can hear and work with\n\n00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.267\nto understand where you are,\n\n00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:45.072\nhow you need to move, and where you need to go.\n\n00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:47.796\nSimilarly, just through the grip of the cane,\n\n00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:51.710\nyou can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,\n\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.144\nand over time you build a pattern of where you are\n\n00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:55.686\nand where you're headed.\n\n00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:58.578\nSimilarly, just the sun warming one side of your face\n\n00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:01.407\nor the wind at your neck\n\n00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.607\ngives you clues about your alignment\n\n00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:05.300\nand your progression through a block\n\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.805\nand your movement through time and space.\n\n00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:11.238\nBut also, the sense of smell.\n\n00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:13.939\nSome districts and cities have their own smell,\n\n00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.980\nas do places and things around you,\n\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.772\nand if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose\n\n00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:22.201\nto that new bakery that you've been looking for.\n\n00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:23.910\nAll this really surprised me,\n\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.915\nbecause I started to realize that\n\n00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:29.468\nmy unsighted experienced\n\n00:06:29.468 --> 00:06:31.903\nwas so far more multi-sensory\n\n00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.928\nthan my sighted experience ever was.\n\n00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:37.668\nWhat struck me also was how much the city\n\n00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:39.300\nwas changing around me.\n\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.037\nWhen you're sighted,\n\n00:06:41.037 --> 00:06:43.226\neverybody kind of sticks to themselves,\n\n00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:45.039\nyou mind your own business.\n\n00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.306\nLose your sight, though,\n\n00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.105\nand it's a whole other story.\n\n00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:50.584\nAnd I don't know who's watching who,\n\n00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:54.133\nbut I have a suspicion that\na lot of people are watching me.\n\n00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.281\nAnd I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,\n\n00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.310\nI'm getting all sorts of advice:\n\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.630\nGo here, move there, watch out for this.\n\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.707\nA lot of the information is good.\n\n00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:06.193\nSome of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.\n\n00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:09.762\nYou've got to figure out what they actually meant.\n\n00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.315\nSome of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.\n\n00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:16.326\nBut it's all good in the grand scheme of things.\n\n00:07:16.326 --> 00:07:17.862\nBut one time I was in Oakland\n\n00:07:17.862 --> 00:07:20.749\nwalking along Broadway, and came to a corner.\n\n00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:23.556\nI was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,\n\n00:07:23.556 --> 00:07:26.042\nand as it went off, I was just about\nto step out into the street,\n\n00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:28.074\nwhen all of a sudden, my right hand\n\n00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:29.754\nwas just gripped by this guy,\n\n00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:32.166\nand he yanked my arm\nand pulled me out into the crosswalk\n\n00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.840\nand was dragging me out across the street,\n\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.092\nspeaking to me in Mandarin.\n\n00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:37.500\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.639\nIt's like, there was no escape\nfrom this man's death grip,\n\n00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.362\nbut he got me safely there.\n\n00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.712\nWhat could I do?\n\n00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:47.508\nBut believe me, there are more polite ways\n\n00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:49.681\nto offer assistance.\n\n00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:51.203\nWe don't know you're there,\n\n00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.183\nso it's kind of nice to say \"Hello\" first.\n\n00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:55.319\n\"Would you like some help?\"\n\n00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.370\nBut while in Oakland, I've really been struck by\n\n00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.988\nhow much the city of Oakland changed\n\n00:08:00.988 --> 00:08:03.490\nas I lost my sight.\n\n00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.657\nI liked it sighted. It was fine.\n\n00:08:05.657 --> 00:08:08.233\nIt's a perfectly great city.\n\n00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:09.502\nBut once I lost my sight\n\n00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:11.817\nand was walking along Broadway,\n\n00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:15.028\nI was blessed every block of the way.\n\n00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:16.582\n\"Bless you, man.\"\n\n00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:18.845\n\"Go for it, brother.\"\n\n00:08:18.845 --> 00:08:20.595\n\"God bless you.\"\n\n00:08:20.595 --> 00:08:22.455\nI didn't get that sighted.\n\n00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:23.791\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:30.116\nAnd even without sight,\nI don't get that in San Francisco.\n\n00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:33.108\nAnd I know it bothers some of my blind friends,\n\n00:08:33.108 --> 00:08:34.701\nit's not just me.\n\n00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.750\nOften it's thought that\n\n00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.894\nthat's an emotion that comes up out of pity.\n\n00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:43.007\nI tend to think that it comes\nout of our shared humanity,\n\n00:08:43.007 --> 00:08:46.117\nout of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.\n\n00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:47.977\nIn fact, if I'm feeling down,\n\n00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:49.885\nI just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,\n\n00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:52.544\nI go for a walk, and I feel better like that,\n\n00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:55.815\nin no time at all.\n\n00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:57.850\nBut also that it illustrates how\n\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.632\ndisability and blindness\n\n00:08:59.632 --> 00:09:02.352\nsort of cuts across ethnic, social,\n\n00:09:02.352 --> 00:09:05.078\nracial, economic lines.\n\n00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:08.913\nDisability is an equal-opportunity provider.\n\n00:09:08.913 --> 00:09:11.356\nEverybody's welcome.\n\n00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:13.917\nIn fact, I've heard it said in the disability community\n\n00:09:13.917 --> 00:09:16.419\nthat there are really only two types of people:\n\n00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:18.178\nThere are those with disabilities,\n\n00:09:18.178 --> 00:09:22.840\nand there are those that haven't\nquite found theirs yet.\n\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.961\nIt's a different way of thinking about it,\n\n00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:27.210\nbut I think it's kind of beautiful,\n\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.386\nbecause it is certainly far more inclusive\n\n00:09:29.386 --> 00:09:31.491\nthan the us-versus-them\n\n00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:34.059\nor the abled-versus-the-disabled,\n\n00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:36.837\nand it's a lot more honest and respectful\n\n00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:40.141\nof the fragility of life.\n\n00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:42.066\nSo my final takeaway for you is\n\n00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:46.134\nthat not only is the city good for the blind,\n\n00:09:46.134 --> 00:09:49.313\nbut the city needs us.\n\n00:09:49.313 --> 00:09:51.351\nAnd I'm so sure of that that\n\n00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:52.947\nI want to propose to you today\n\n00:09:52.947 --> 00:09:56.387\nthat the blind be taken as\nthe prototypical city dwellers\n\n00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:59.672\nwhen imagining new and wonderful cities,\n\n00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:01.533\nand not the people that are thought about\n\n00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.766\nafter the mold has already been cast.\n\n00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:06.819\nIt's too late then.\n\n00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:10.003\nSo if you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:10.003 --> 00:10:14.588\nyou'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks\n\n00:10:14.588 --> 00:10:16.702\nwith a dense array of options and choices\n\n00:10:16.702 --> 00:10:20.134\nall available at the street level.\n\n00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:22.456\nIf you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.576\nsidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.\n\n00:10:25.576 --> 00:10:27.929\nThe space between buildings will be well-balanced\n\n00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:31.368\nbetween people and cars.\n\n00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:35.425\nIn fact, cars, who needs them?\n\n00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:38.510\nIf you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.873\nThey don't like it when you drive. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:41.873 --> 00:10:44.583\nIf you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:47.226\nyou design a city with a robust,\n\n00:10:47.226 --> 00:10:50.918\naccessible, well-connected mass transit system\n\n00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:52.520\nthat connects all parts of the city\n\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.539\nand the region all around.\n\n00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:57.605\nIf you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:57.605 --> 00:11:00.424\nthere'll be jobs, lots of jobs.\n\n00:11:00.424 --> 00:11:01.754\nBlind people want to work too.\n\n00:11:01.754 --> 00:11:04.193\nThey want to earn a living.\n\n00:11:04.193 --> 00:11:06.949\nSo, in designing a city for the blind,\n\n00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:09.018\nI hope you start to realize\n\n00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.896\nthat it actually would be a more inclusive,\n\n00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:15.502\na more equitable, a more just city for all.\n\n00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:17.722\nAnd based on my prior sighted experience,\n\n00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:19.700\nit sounds like a pretty cool city,\n\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.047\nwhether you're blind, whether you have a disability,\n\n00:11:23.047 --> 00:11:25.531\nor you haven't quite found yours yet.\n\n00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.143\nSo thank you.\n\n00:11:28.143 --> 00:11:32.143\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The link between unemployment and terrorism", "duration": "541", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mohamed_ali_the_link_between_unemployment_and_terrorism", "transcript": "I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid. I don't know his name, but I do know his story. He lives in a small village in southern Somalia. His village is near Mogadishu. Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. With nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. When he arrives, there are no opportunities, no jobs, no way forward. He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Maybe a year passes, nothing. One day, he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch, then to dinner, to breakfast. He meets this dynamic group of people, and they give him a break. He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes, money to send back home to his family. He is introduced to this young woman. He eventually gets married. He starts this new life. He has a purpose in life.One beautiful day in Mogadishu, under an azure blue sky, a car bomb goes off. That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda.So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up? He was waiting. He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along. This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood.And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world. It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg, sparks riots in London, who reaches out for something other than waithood. For young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them opportunities, the story of waithood, the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the story of cities 2.0. And in my city of birth, Mogadishu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment. 70 percent don't work, don't go to school. They pretty much do nothing.I went back to Mogadishu last month, and I went to visit Madina Hospital, the hospital I was born in. I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking, what if I had never left? What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood? Would I have become a terrorist? I'm not really sure about the answer.My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit. I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders. We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city.One of the young men in the room was Aden. He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated. There were no jobs, no opportunities. I remember him telling me, because he was a college graduate, unemployed, frustrated, that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited. They sought people like him out.But his story takes a different route. In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads. Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. Aden saw an opportunity and seized it. He started a motorbike company. He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. He bought 10 bikes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years.How is this story different? What makes his story different? I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. It's entrepreneurship, and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking.And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs. I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist. He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship. He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. If you asked someone, \"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?\" for many who grew up under civil war, the answer would be, \"Never.\"So Mohamed saw an opportunity. He started a landscaping and design floral company. He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu, and started growing tulips and lilies, which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate. And he began delivering flowers to weddings, creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city, and he's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years. There's no public park in Mogadishu. He wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together, and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses. And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water, by the way.So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room. They had never really thought about starting up a business. They've thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact on them. He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be change makers. By the end of the day, they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city. They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems.So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality. They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses. Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth.For me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business. It's about creating a social impact. Mohamed is not simply selling flowers. I believe he is selling hope. His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city. Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.So my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1864, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.155 -->

story.\n\n00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:23.272\nHe lives in a small village in southern Somalia.\n\n00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:27.302\nHis village is near Mogadishu.\n\n00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.476\nDrought drives the small village into poverty\n\n00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.344\nand to the brink of starvation.\n\n00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:33.180\nWith nothing left for him there,\n\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.007\nhe leaves for the big city,\n\n00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.412\nin this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.\n\n00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.242\nWhen he arrives, there are no opportunities,\n\n00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.230\nno jobs, no way forward.\n\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.254\nHe ends up living in a tent city\n\n00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.958\non the outskirts of Mogadishu.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:52.967\nMaybe a year passes, nothing.\n\n00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.267\nOne day, he's approached by a gentleman\n\n00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:57.465\nwho offers to take him to lunch,\n\n00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:00.541\nthen to dinner, to breakfast.\n\n00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.560\nHe meets this dynamic group of people,\n\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.065\nand they give him a break.\n\n00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.384\nHe's given a bit of money\n\n00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:08.486\nto buy himself some new clothes,\n\n00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:11.022\nmoney to send back home to his family.\n\n00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.995\nHe is introduced to this young woman.\n\n00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:14.710\nHe eventually gets married.\n\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.515\nHe starts this new life.\n\n00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.441\nHe has a purpose in life.\n\n00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.215\nOne beautiful day in Mogadishu,\n\n00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:26.103\nunder an azure blue sky,\n\n00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:28.624\na car bomb goes off.\n\n00:01:28.624 --> 00:01:31.819\nThat small town kid with the big city dreams\n\n00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.067\nwas the suicide bomber,\n\n00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:36.425\nand that dynamic group of people\n\n00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.794\nwere al Shabaab, a terrorist organization\n\n00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:42.475\nlinked to al Qaeda.\n\n00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:45.347\nSo how does the story of a small town kid\n\n00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:47.168\njust trying to make it big in the city\n\n00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:49.998\nend up with him blowing himself up?\n\n00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:51.970\nHe was waiting.\n\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.868\nHe was waiting for an opportunity,\n\n00:01:53.868 --> 00:01:55.650\nwaiting to begin his future,\n\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.685\nwaiting for a way forward,\n\n00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.064\nand this was the first thing that came along.\n\n00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:02.478\nThis was the first thing that pulled him out\n\n00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.418\nof what we call waithood.\n\n00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:07.714\nAnd his story repeats itself\n\n00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:10.130\nin urban centers around the world.\n\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.884\nIt is the story of the disenfranchised,\n\n00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:14.692\nunemployed urban youth\n\n00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:18.635\nwho sparks riots in Johannesburg,\n\n00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:20.969\nsparks riots in London,\n\n00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.623\nwho reaches out for something other than waithood.\n\n00:02:25.623 --> 00:02:28.287\nFor young people, the promise of the city,\n\n00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:30.981\nthe big city dream is that of opportunity,\n\n00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:33.136\nof jobs, of wealth,\n\n00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:36.877\nbut young people are not sharing\nin the prosperity of their cities.\n\n00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:40.975\nOften it's youth who suffer from\nthe highest unemployment rates.\n\n00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:44.168\nBy 2030, three out of five people living in cities\n\n00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:46.728\nwill be under the age of 18.\n\n00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:48.492\nIf we do not include young people\n\n00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:50.311\nin the growth of our cities,\n\n00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.790\nif we do not provide them opportunities,\n\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.812\nthe story of waithood,\n\n00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:57.725\nthe gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,\n\n00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:01.900\nwill be the story of cities 2.0.\n\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.061\nAnd in my city of birth, Mogadishu,\n\n00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:08.751\n70 percent of young people\nsuffer from unemployment.\n\n00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:11.129\n70 percent don't work,\n\n00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.156\ndon't go to school.\n\n00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:15.581\nThey pretty much do nothing.\n\n00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.097\nI went back to Mogadishu last month,\n\n00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:21.107\nand I went to visit Madina Hospital,\n\n00:03:21.107 --> 00:03:23.155\nthe hospital I was born in.\n\n00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:25.180\nI remember standing in front of that\n\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.158\nbullet-ridden hospital thinking,\n\n00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:30.191\nwhat if I had never left?\n\n00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.384\nWhat if I had been forced\n\n00:03:31.384 --> 00:03:33.903\ninto that same state of waithood?\n\n00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:37.914\nWould I have become a terrorist?\n\n00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:40.805\nI'm not really sure about the answer.\n\n00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:42.973\nMy reason for being in Mogadishu that month\n\n00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.520\nwas actually to host\n\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.067\na youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.\n\n00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:50.063\nI brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.\n\n00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.309\nWe sat down and brainstormed on solutions\n\n00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.185\nto the biggest challenges facing their city.\n\n00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:58.587\nOne of the young men in the room was Aden.\n\n00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:03.042\nHe went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.\n\n00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.231\nThere were no jobs, no opportunities.\n\n00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.949\nI remember him telling me,\n\n00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.757\nbecause he was a college graduate,\n\n00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:12.507\nunemployed, frustrated,\n\n00:04:12.507 --> 00:04:14.904\nthat he was the perfect target for al Shabaab\n\n00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.956\nand other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.\n\n00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:21.834\nThey sought people like him out.\n\n00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:24.930\nBut his story takes a different route.\n\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.867\nIn Mogadishu, the biggest barrier\n\n00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:30.120\nto getting from point A to point B are the roads.\n\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.903\nTwenty-three years of civil war\n\n00:04:31.903 --> 00:04:34.134\nhave completely destroyed the road system,\n\n00:04:34.134 --> 00:04:36.143\nand a motorbike can be the easiest way\n\n00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:37.773\nto get around.\n\n00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:41.014\nAden saw an opportunity and seized it.\n\n00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.139\nHe started a motorbike company.\n\n00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.430\nHe began renting out motorbikes\n\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.730\nto local residents who couldn't normally afford them.\n\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.751\nHe bought 10 bikes, with the help\n\n00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:52.449\nof family and friends,\n\n00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.182\nand his dream is to eventually expand\n\n00:04:54.182 --> 00:04:57.163\nto several hundred within the next three years.\n\n00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.731\nHow is this story different?\n\n00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:02.088\nWhat makes his story different?\n\n00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:04.918\nI believe it is his ability to identify\n\n00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:08.256\nand seize a new opportunity.\n\n00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:10.287\nIt's entrepreneurship,\n\n00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:12.046\nand I believe entrepreneurship can be\n\n00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:15.024\nthe most powerful tool against waithood.\n\n00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:16.794\nIt empowers young people\n\n00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:20.174\nto be the creators of the very economic opportunities\n\n00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:22.672\nthey are so desperately seeking.\n\n00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:26.354\nAnd you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.\n\n00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:28.470\nI want to talk to you about a young man\n\n00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.759\nwho attended one of my meetings,\n\n00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.643\nMohamed Mohamoud, a florist.\n\n00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:35.326\nHe was helping me train some of the young people\n\n00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:36.763\nat the summit in entrepreneurship\n\n00:05:36.763 --> 00:05:38.385\nand how to be innovative\n\n00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:41.152\nand how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.\n\n00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:43.649\nHe's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen\n\n00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.333\nin over 22 years,\n\n00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.597\nand until recently, until Mohamed came along,\n\n00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:51.487\nif you wanted flowers at your wedding,\n\n00:05:51.487 --> 00:05:52.880\nyou used plastic bouquets\n\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.466\nshipped from abroad.\n\n00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:56.272\nIf you asked someone,\n\n00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.547\n\"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?\"\n\n00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:01.133\nfor many who grew up under civil war,\n\n00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:03.916\nthe answer would be, \"Never.\"\n\n00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.864\nSo Mohamed saw an opportunity.\n\n00:06:05.864 --> 00:06:10.311\nHe started a landscaping and design floral company.\n\n00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:13.619\nHe created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,\n\n00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.675\nand started growing tulips and lilies,\n\n00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.381\nwhich he said could survive\n\n00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:20.092\nthe harsh Mogadishu climate.\n\n00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:23.790\nAnd he began delivering flowers to weddings,\n\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.723\ncreating gardens at homes\n\n00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:28.327\nand businesses around the city,\n\n00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:30.064\nand he's now working on creating\n\n00:06:30.064 --> 00:06:33.689\nMogadishu's first public park in 22 years.\n\n00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.788\nThere's no public park in Mogadishu.\n\n00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:38.117\nHe wants to create a space where families,\n\n00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:39.768\nyoung people, can come together,\n\n00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:44.406\nand, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.\n\n00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:46.362\nAnd he doesn't grow roses because\n\n00:06:46.362 --> 00:06:50.486\nthey use too much water, by the way.\n\n00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:54.798\nSo the first step is to inspire young people,\n\n00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:56.990\nand in that room, Mohamed's presence\n\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.466\nhad a really profound impact\non the youth in that room.\n\n00:07:00.466 --> 00:07:03.053\nThey had never really thought\nabout starting up a business.\n\n00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:04.900\nThey've thought about working for an NGO,\n\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.587\nworking for the government,\n\n00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:10.894\nbut his story, his innovation,\n\n00:07:10.894 --> 00:07:12.847\nreally had a strong impact on them.\n\n00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:14.966\nHe forced them to look at their city\n\n00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:16.720\nas a place of opportunity.\n\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.468\nHe empowered them to believe\nthat they could be entrepreneurs,\n\n00:07:20.468 --> 00:07:22.888\nthat they could be change makers.\n\n00:07:22.888 --> 00:07:24.448\nBy the end of the day, they were coming up\n\n00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:25.999\nwith innovative solutions\n\n00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:29.331\nto some of the biggest challenges facing their city.\n\n00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.934\nThey came up with entrepreneurial solutions\n\n00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:34.856\nto local problems.\n\n00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:37.087\nSo inspiring young people\n\n00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:39.501\nand creating a culture of entrepreneurship\n\n00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.368\nis a really great step,\n\n00:07:41.368 --> 00:07:43.057\nbut young people need capital\n\n00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:44.846\nto make their ideas a reality.\n\n00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:47.170\nThey need expertise and mentorship\n\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.570\nto guide them in developing\nand launching their businesses.\n\n00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.057\nConnect young people with the resources they need,\n\n00:07:53.057 --> 00:07:56.522\nprovide them the support they need\nto go from ideation to creation,\n\n00:07:56.522 --> 00:08:00.622\nand you will create catalysts for urban growth.\n\n00:08:00.622 --> 00:08:03.546\nFor me, entrepreneurship is more than just\n\n00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:05.102\nstarting up a business.\n\n00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:07.483\nIt's about creating a social impact.\n\n00:08:07.483 --> 00:08:09.618\nMohamed is not simply selling flowers.\n\n00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:12.105\nI believe he is selling hope.\n\n00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:14.694\nHis Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,\n\n00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.866\nwhen it's created, will actually transform\n\n00:08:16.866 --> 00:08:18.938\nthe way people see their city.\n\n00:08:18.938 --> 00:08:21.091\nAden hired street kids to help rent out\n\n00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:22.953\nand maintain those bikes for him.\n\n00:08:22.953 --> 00:08:25.011\nHe gave them the opportunity to escape\n\n00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:27.947\nthe paralysis of waithood.\n\n00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:29.977\nThese young entrepreneurs are having\n\n00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:33.511\na tremendous impact in their cities.\n\n00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:36.027\nSo my suggestion is,\n\n00:08:36.027 --> 00:08:38.543\nturn youth into

from each other", "duration": "776", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_larsson_what_doctors_can_learn_from_each_other", "transcript": "Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical, and I returned to the medical university where I studied. I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years, in fact since I became a management consultant.There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent. The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting, and the second thing, which really bothered me, actually, was that several of the colleagues I met, former friends from medical school, who I knew to be some of the smartest, most motivated, engaged and passionate people I'd ever met, many of them had turned cynical, disengaged, or had distanced themselves from hospital management. So with this focus on cost-cutting, I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. It's a big part of the national budgets. And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. In some countries, we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. In other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed, and therefore don't reach patients. In several countries, doctors and nurses are the targets, to some extent, for the governments. After all, the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. You choose an expensive lab test, you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians, this is a way to hold costs down. And ultimately, some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated.At BCG, we looked at this, and we asked ourselves, this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. And so we took a step back and we said, \"What is it that we are trying to achieve?\" Ultimately, in the healthcare system, we're aiming at improving health for the patients, and we need to do so at a limited, or affordable, cost. We call this value-based healthcare. On the screen behind me, you see what we mean by value: outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.On this picture, you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. When we started doing our research at BCG, we decided not to look so much at the costs, but to look at the quality instead, and in the research, one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. You compare hospitals in a country, you'll find some that are extremely good, but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. The differences were dramatic. Erik, my father-in-law, he suffers from prostate cancer, and he probably needs surgery. Now living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system. If he goes there and goes to the average hospital, he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent, so he would have to start wearing diapers again. You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. If he instead would go to Hamburg, and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik, the risk would be only one in 20. Either you a flip a coin, or you have a one in 20 risk. That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference. When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases, we see these huge differences.But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. And often, the data actually doesn't exist. Nobody knows. So going the hospital is a lottery.Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. In the late '70s, there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting, and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. To the left of this slide, you see a variety of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. They all realized they had their individual way of operating. They all argued that, \"My technique is the best,\" but none of them actually knew, and they admitted that. So they said, \"We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best.\" So they in fact spent two years debating, \"So what is quality in hip surgery?\" \"Oh, we should measure this.\" \"No, we should measure that.\" And they finally agreed. And once they had agreed, they started measuring, and started sharing the data. Very quickly, they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in, it actually lasted a lot longer, and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime. They published the data, and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. Since then, they publish every year. Once a year, they publish the league table: who's best, who's at the bottom? And they visit each other to try to learn, so a continuous cycle of improvement. For many years, Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world, at least for those who actually were measuring, and many were not.Now I found this principle really exciting. So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it. Continuous improvement.Now, that's not the only exciting part. That's exciting in itself. But if you bring back the cost side of the equation, and look at that, it turns out, those who have focused on quality, they actually also have the lowest costs, although that's not been the purpose in the first place. So if you look at the hip surgery story again, there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery. In the United States, the number was three times higher than in Sweden. So many unnecessary surgeries, and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. Now, you can imagine how much savings there would be for society.We did a study where we looked at OECD data. OECD does, every so often, look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. The United States has, for many diseases, actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. Now, if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality, and raise quality just to the level of average OECD, it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year. That's 20 percent of the budget, of the healthcare budget of the country.Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic, and it's all logical, but is it possible? This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare, and I would argue that not only can it be done, but it has to be done. The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system.In my practice as a consultant, I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. Physicians are, like most of you in the audience, very competitive. They were always best in class. We were always best in class. And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do, they will do whatever it takes to improve. But most of them don't know. But physicians have another characteristic. They actually thrive from peer recognition. If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results, they will share. They will share the information on how to improve. So it is, by measuring and creating transparency, you get a cycle of continuous improvement, which is what this slide shows.Now, you may say this is a nice idea, but this isn't only an idea. This is happening in reality. We're creating a global community, and a large global community, where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. Together with two academic institutions, Michael Porter at Harvard Business School, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. You may think that's a sneeze, but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym. It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss, disease by disease, what is really quality, what should we measure, and to make those standards global. They've worked \u2014 four working groups have worked during the past year: cataracts, back pain, coronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack, and prostate cancer. The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples, not only within a country, but between countries. Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases, the year after, 16. In three years' time, we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden. Compare apples to apples. Who's better? Why is that?Five months ago, I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. They have a new CEO, and she has a vision: I want to manage my big institution much more on quality, outcomes that matter to patients. This particular day, we sat in a workshop together with physicians, nurses and other staff, discussing leukemia in children. The group discussed, how do we measure quality today? Can we measure it better than we do? We discussed, how do we treat these kids, what are important improvements? And we discussed what are the costs for these patients, can we do treatment more efficiently? There was an enormous energy in the room. There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm. At the end of the meeting, the chairman of the department, he stood up. He looked over the group and he said \u2014 first he raised his hand, I forgot that \u2014 he raised his hand, clenched his fist, and then he said to the group, \"Thank you. Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way.\"By measuring value in healthcare, that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients, we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution, and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates, who always put the patient at the center, he would smile in his grave.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1873, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:15.047\nFive years ago, I was on a

00:06:06.993\nand many were not.\n\n00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:09.875\nNow I found this principle really exciting.\n\n00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.678\nSo the physicians get together,\n\n00:06:11.678 --> 00:06:13.803\nthey agree on what quality is,\n\n00:06:13.803 --> 00:06:17.517\nthey start measuring, they share the data,\n\n00:06:17.517 --> 00:06:21.033\nthey find who's best, and they learn from it.\n\n00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:23.625\nContinuous improvement.\n\n00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:26.173\nNow, that's not the only exciting part.\n\n00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:28.424\nThat's exciting in itself.\n\n00:06:28.424 --> 00:06:31.375\nBut if you bring back the cost side of the equation,\n\n00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:32.835\nand look at that,\n\n00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:35.840\nit turns out, those who have focused on quality,\n\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.873\nthey actually also have the lowest costs,\n\n00:06:37.873 --> 00:06:40.542\nalthough that's not been the purpose\nin the first place.\n\n00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:43.572\nSo if you look at the hip surgery story again,\n\n00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:45.943\nthere was a study done a couple years ago\n\n00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:49.941\nwhere they compared the U.S. and Sweden.\n\n00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.866\nThey looked at how many patients have needed\n\n00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:55.947\nto be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.\n\n00:06:55.947 --> 00:06:58.834\nIn the United States, the number was three times\n\n00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:01.022\nhigher than in Sweden.\n\n00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:04.462\nSo many unnecessary surgeries,\n\n00:07:04.462 --> 00:07:07.202\nand so much unnecessary suffering\n\n00:07:07.202 --> 00:07:08.894\nfor all the patients who were operated on\n\n00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:11.361\nin that seven year period.\n\n00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.940\nNow, you can imagine how much savings\n\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.440\nthere would be for society.\n\n00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.611\nWe did a study where we looked at OECD data.\n\n00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:21.461\nOECD does, every so often,\n\n00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:23.617\nlook at quality of care\n\n00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:28.142\nwhere they can find the data\nacross the member countries.\n\n00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:30.744\nThe United States has, for many diseases,\n\n00:07:30.744 --> 00:07:32.948\nactually a quality which is below the average\n\n00:07:32.948 --> 00:07:34.366\nin OECD.\n\n00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:36.520\nNow, if the American healthcare system\n\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.956\nwould focus a lot more on measuring quality,\n\n00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:43.005\nand raise quality just to the level of average OECD,\n\n00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:45.343\nit would save the American people\n\n00:07:45.343 --> 00:07:49.469\n500 billion U.S. dollars a year.\n\n00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.696\nThat's 20 percent of the budget,\n\n00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:55.409\nof the healthcare budget of the country.\n\n00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.516\nNow you may say that these numbers\n\n00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:00.407\nare fantastic, and it's all logical,\n\n00:08:00.407 --> 00:08:02.417\nbut is it possible?\n\n00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:05.056\nThis would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,\n\n00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:08.636\nand I would argue that not only can it be done,\n\n00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:10.870\nbut it has to be done.\n\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.261\nThe agents of change are the doctors and nurses\n\n00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.953\nin the healthcare system.\n\n00:08:16.953 --> 00:08:19.067\nIn my practice as a consultant,\n\n00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:21.334\nI meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred\n\n00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.211\ndoctors and nurses and other hospital\n\n00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:27.168\nor healthcare staff every year.\n\n00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:29.354\nThe one thing they have in common is\n\n00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:31.632\nthey really care about what they achieve\n\n00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:34.866\nin terms of quality for their patients.\n\n00:08:34.866 --> 00:08:36.949\nPhysicians are, like most of you in the audience,\n\n00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:39.485\nvery competitive.\n\n00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.235\nThey were always best in class.\n\n00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.733\nWe were always best in class.\n\n00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.347\nAnd if somebody can show them that the result\n\n00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:48.934\nthey perform for their patients\n\n00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:51.788\nis no better than what others do,\n\n00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:54.495\nthey will do whatever it takes to improve.\n\n00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:56.828\nBut most of them don't know.\n\n00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.243\nBut physicians have another characteristic.\n\n00:08:59.243 --> 00:09:03.085\nThey actually thrive from peer recognition.\n\n00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:05.319\nIf a cardiologist calls another cardiologist\n\n00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:07.167\nin a competing hospital\n\n00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:09.196\nand discusses why that other hospital\n\n00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:11.991\nhas so much better results, they will share.\n\n00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:15.708\nThey will share the information on how to improve.\n\n00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:19.828\nSo it is, by measuring and creating transparency,\n\n00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:22.738\nyou get a cycle of continuous improvement,\n\n00:09:22.738 --> 00:09:25.612\nwhich is what this slide shows.\n\n00:09:25.612 --> 00:09:28.553\nNow, you may say this is a nice idea,\n\n00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:30.457\nbut this isn't only an idea.\n\n00:09:30.457 --> 00:09:32.485\nThis is happening in reality.\n\n00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:35.639\nWe're creating a global community,\n\n00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.502\nand a large global community,\n\n00:09:37.502 --> 00:09:40.049\nwhere we'll be able to measure and compare\n\n00:09:40.049 --> 00:09:41.763\nwhat we achieve.\n\n00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:44.390\nTogether with two academic institutions,\n\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.384\nMichael Porter at Harvard Business School,\n\n00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:48.268\nand the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,\n\n00:09:48.268 --> 00:09:52.233\nBCG has formed something we call ICHOM.\n\n00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:54.438\nYou may think that's a sneeze,\n\n00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:57.565\nbut it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.\n\n00:09:57.565 --> 00:10:00.141\nIt stands for the International Consortium\n\n00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.101\nfor Health Outcome Measurement.\n\n00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:05.850\nWe're bringing together leading physicians\n\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.441\nand patients to discuss, disease by disease,\n\n00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.543\nwhat is really quality,\n\n00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:13.530\nwhat should we measure,\n\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.018\nand to make those standards global.\n\n00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:18.373\nThey've worked -- four working groups have worked\n\n00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:20.341\nduring the past year:\n\n00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:23.185\ncataracts, back pain,\n\n00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:27.411\ncoronary artery disease, which is,\nfor instance, heart attack,\n\n00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:29.592\nand prostate cancer.\n\n00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:31.996\nThe four groups will publish their data\n\n00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:33.838\nin November of this year.\n\n00:10:33.838 --> 00:10:36.296\nThat's the first time we'll be comparing\n\n00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:39.242\napples to apples, not only within a country,\n\n00:10:39.242 --> 00:10:42.423\nbut between countries.\n\n00:10:42.423 --> 00:10:46.401\nNext year, we're planning to do eight diseases,\n\n00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:48.955\nthe year after, 16.\n\n00:10:48.955 --> 00:10:51.411\nIn three years' time, we plan to have covered\n\n00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:54.524\n40 percent of the disease burden.\n\n00:10:54.524 --> 00:10:57.174\nCompare apples to apples. Who's better?\n\n00:10:57.174 --> 00:11:00.225\nWhy is that?\n\n00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:03.090\nFive months ago,\n\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.124\nI led a workshop at the largest university hospital\n\n00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.834\nin Northern Europe.\n\n00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:11.321\nThey have a new CEO, and she has a vision:\n\n00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:14.927\nI want to manage my big institution much more\n\n00:11:14.927 --> 00:11:19.032\non quality, outcomes that matter to patients.\n\n00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:22.530\nThis particular day, we sat in a workshop\n\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.340\ntogether with physicians, nurses and other staff,\n\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.838\ndiscussing leukemia in children.\n\n00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:31.615\nThe group discussed,\n\n00:11:31.615 --> 00:11:33.655\nhow do we measure quality today?\n\n00:11:33.655 --> 00:11:36.220\nCan we measure it better than we do?\n\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.442\nWe discussed, how do we treat these kids,\n\n00:11:38.442 --> 00:11:40.493\nwhat are important improvements?\n\n00:11:40.493 --> 00:11:43.274\nAnd we discussed what are\nthe costs for these patients,\n\n00:11:43.274 --> 00:11:45.622\ncan we do treatment more efficiently?\n\n00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.566\nThere was an enormous energy in the room.\n\n00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:51.055\nThere were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.\n\n00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:53.349\nAt the end of the meeting,\n\n00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:56.658\nthe chairman of the department, he stood up.\n\n00:11:56.658 --> 00:12:01.235\nHe looked over the group and he said --\n\n00:12:01.235 --> 00:12:03.020\nfirst he raised his hand, I forgot that --\n\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.489\nhe raised his hand, clenched his fist,\n\n00:12:05.489 --> 00:12:08.386\nand then he said to the group, \"Thank you.\n\n00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:11.309\nThank you. Today, we're finally discussing\n\n00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:14.883\nwhat this hospital does the right way.\"\n\n00:12:14.883 --> 00:12:16.970\nBy measuring value in healthcare,\n\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.995\nthat is not only costs\n\n00:12:18.995 --> 00:12:21.468\nbut outcomes that matter to patients,\n\n00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:23.266\nwe will make staff in hospitals\n\n00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:25.125\nand elsewhere in the healthcare system\n\n00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:29.219\nnot a problem but an important part of the solution.\n\n00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:31.155\nI believe measuring value in healthcare\n\n00:12:31.155 --> 00:12:33.926\nwill bring about a revolution,\n\n00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:36.035\nand I'm convinced that the founder\n\n00:12:36.035 --> 00:12:39.498\nof modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,\n\n00:12:39.498 --> 00:12:42.448\nwho always put the patient at the center,\n\n00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:44.610\nhe would smile in his grave.\n\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.411\nThank you.\n\n00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:51.320\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Massively multi-player\u2026 thumb-wrestling?", "duration": "438", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_massively_multi_player_thumb_wrestling", "transcript": "Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you, the player, the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less. This is true, so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute, you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise, pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder, contentment, and creativity, all in the span of one minute.So this sounds pretty good, right? Now you're willing to play. In order to teach you this game, I'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly, and we're going to do a little hands-on demo. While they're coming up, I should let you know, this game was invented 10 years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. So thank you, Monochrom. Okay, so most people are familiar with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling. Sunni, let's just remind them. One, two, three, four,  I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle, and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best.Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, we're the gamer generation. There are a billion gamers on the planet now, so we need more of a challenge. So the first thing we need is more thumbs. So Eric, come on over. So we could get three thumbs together, and Peter could join us. We could even have four thumbs together, and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb. This is really important. You can't, like, wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute. That is not how you win. Ah, who did that? Eric you did that. So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb. Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node, but if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back. We can really go for it. So you can see up here. Now the only other rule you need to remember is, gamer generation, we like a challenge. I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. So I think we should kind of get some more involved. And if we had just four people, we would do it just like this, and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. Perfect.Now, if we had more people in the room, instead of just wrestling in a closed node, we might reach out and try and grab some other people. And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now. We're going to try and get all, something like, I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node. And we have to connect both levels, so if you're up there, you're going to be reaching down and reaching up.Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 before we get started \u2014 This is great. You're excited to play. \u2014 before we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick, because if you get good at this game, I want you to know there are some advanced levels. So this is the kind of simple level, right? But there are advanced configurations. This is called the Death Star Configuration. Any Star Wars fans? And this one's called the M\u00f6bius Strip. Any science geeks, you get that one. This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.So we'll stick with the normal one for now, and I'm going to give you 30 seconds, every thumb into the node, connect the upper and the lower levels, you guys go on down there. Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.Stand up! It's easier if you stand up. Everybody, up up up up up! Stand up, my friends. All right. Don't start wrestling yet. If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected. Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check. If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure. Grab that thumb! Reach behind you. There you go. Any other thumbs? Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go. Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it. Okay? One, two, three, go!(Laughter)Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent! (Applause) Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.All right. While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game, let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions. So curiosity. I said \"massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.\" You were like, \"What the hell is she talking about?\" So I provoked a little curiosity. Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. So you used creativity. That was great. How about surprise? The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising. You heard that sound go up in the room. We had excitement. As you started to wrestle, maybe you're starting to win or this person's, like, really into it, so you kind of get the excitement going. We have relief. You got to stand up. You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief, getting to shake it out. We had joy. You were laughing, smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy. We had some contentment. I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing, so you were totally content to be playing. The most important three emotions, awe and wonder, we had everybody connected physically for a minute. When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room? And it's truly awesome and wondrous. And speaking of physical connection, you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin, you release oxytocin, you feel bonded to everyone in the room. You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds. You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds, so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other. That is great.And the last emotion of pride. How many people are like me. Just admit it. You lost both your thumbs. It just didn't work out for you. That's okay, because you learned a new skill today. You learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before. Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people. So congratulations. How many of you won just won thumb? All right. I have very good news for you. According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, this makes you a grandmaster of the game. Because there aren't that many people who know how to play, we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess. So congratulations, grandmasters. Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster. Did anybody win both their thumbs? Yes. Awesome. Okay. Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. You guys, according to the rules, are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations. I will just leave you with this tip, if you want to play again. The best way to become a legendary grandmaster, you've got your two nodes going on. Pick off the one that looks easiest. They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.

You can't, like,\n\n00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.866\nwait while they fight it out and\nthen swoop in at the last minute.\n\n00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.361\nThat is not how you win.\n\n00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:50.696\nAh, who did that? Eric you did that.\n\n00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:53.498\nSo Eric would have won. He was\nthe first person to pin my thumb.\n\n00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:54.908\nOkay, so that's the first rule,\n\n00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:56.767\nand we can see that three or four\n\n00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:59.946\nis kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,\n\n00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:02.588\nbut if you feel ambitious,\nyou don't have to hold back.\n\n00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:03.953\nWe can really go for it.\n\n00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:06.119\nSo you can see up here.\n\n00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.091\nNow the only other rule you need to remember is,\n\n00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.358\ngamer generation, we like a challenge.\n\n00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:13.005\nI happen to notice you all have\n\n00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:14.841\nsome thumbs you're not using.\n\n00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:17.848\nSo I think we should kind of get some more involved.\n\n00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:19.618\nAnd if we had just four people,\n\n00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:21.456\nwe would do it just like this,\n\n00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.142\nand we would try and wrestle\n\n00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.923\nboth thumbs at the same time.\n\n00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:26.230\nPerfect.\n\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.344\nNow, if we had more people in the room,\n\n00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:30.223\ninstead of just wrestling in a closed node,\n\n00:02:30.223 --> 00:02:33.006\nwe might reach out and try\nand grab some other people.\n\n00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.727\nAnd in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.\n\n00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:37.279\nWe're going to try and get all, something like,\n\n00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.255\nI don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room\n\n00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:41.568\nconnected in a single node.\n\n00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:44.608\nAnd we have to connect both levels,\n\n00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:47.054\nso if you're up there, you're going to be\n\n00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:49.267\nreaching down and reaching up.\n\n00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:50.941\nNow \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014\n\n00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.833\nbefore we get started --\n\n00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.866\nThis is great. You're excited to play. \u2014\n\n00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:58.946\nbefore we get started, can I have\nthe slides back up here really quick,\n\n00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.903\nbecause if you get good at this game,\n\n00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:03.539\nI want you to know there are some advanced levels.\n\n00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.451\nSo this is the kind of simple level, right?\n\n00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:08.363\nBut there are advanced configurations.\n\n00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:10.373\nThis is called the Death Star Configuration.\n\n00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.080\nAny Star Wars fans?\n\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.428\nAnd this one's called the M\u00f6bius Strip.\n\n00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:16.248\nAny science geeks, you get that one.\n\n00:03:16.248 --> 00:03:19.152\nThis is the hardest level.

What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills, where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener, there lives a great diversity of wildlife, including the one-horned rhinoceros, the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately, these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals, battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks, but that is not an easy task, because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers, and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife.Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime, and these are drones, or more specifically, conservation drones. For about a year now, my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's-eye view of the landscape, but it also allows you to capture detailed, high-resolution images of objects on the ground. This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential, not only for combating wildlife crime, but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations.So what is a drone? Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system, and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer, a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload, such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission, to tell the drone where to go.Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone, but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is, a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars.So now that you've built your own conservation drone, you probably want to go fly it, but how does one fly a drone? Well, actually, you don't, because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open-source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. Sometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area, and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.Now whatever your mission is, once you've programmed it, you simply upload it to the autopilot system, bring your drone to the field, and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way, and usually at that point, we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee, sit back, and relax for the next few minutes, although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does, and when it does, it even lands automatically.So what can we do with a conservation drone? Well, when we built our first prototype drone, our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia, to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine, that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process, so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia, and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far.But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree, seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead, not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon, elephants, and even turtle nests.But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes, we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world, so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest, again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground.But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change, to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding, where forests might be contracting, or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing, but they are also geometrically accurate, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees, calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation, and so on, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently, we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat-emitting objects from the ground, and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are, how you might operate one of these drones, and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then, we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world, and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations.Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range, their ruggedness, and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example, camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests, but these are motion-activated cameras, so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images, and that takes a lot of time, especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone, carrying a special sensor, could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi-fi\u2013enabled cameras.Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous, because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna, not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver, fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio-collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest.A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote, never-explored-before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics, and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals, birds, amphibians, the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests.And finally, I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms, but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors, and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes, which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications.Now, conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe, strongly believe, that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way, they are right. I mean, let's be honest, drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time, we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool, including drones, in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1872, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:15.250\nWhen we think of Nepal,\n\n00:00:15.250 -->

a great diversity of wildlife,\n\n00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:39.427\nincluding the one-horned rhinoceros,\n\n00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:41.101\nthe Asian elephant\n\n00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.176\nand the

ways to help with protecting the forests\n\n00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.142\nand wildlife.\n\n00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:22.651\nWell recently, Nepal acquired a new tool\n\n00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:25.364\nin the fight against wildlife crime,\n\n00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:27.070\nand these are drones,\n\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.344\nor more specifically, conservation drones.\n\n00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:32.858\nFor about a year now, my colleagues and I\n\n00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.118\nhave been building drones for Nepal\n\n00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:37.616\nand training the park protection

00:01:54.226\nThis, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros\n\n00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:57.163\ntaking a cooling bath on a hot summer day\n\n00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:59.126\nin the lowlands of Nepal.\n\n00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:01.357\nNow we believe that drones have\n\n00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:03.165\ntremendous potential,\n\n00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.943\nnot only for combating wildlife

drone?\n\n00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.804\nWell, the kind of drone I'm talking about\n\n00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:16.905\nis simply a model aircraft\n\n00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:19.350\nfitted with an autopilot system,\n\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.619\nand this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,\n\n00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.673\na GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter\n\n00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:29.932\nand a few other sensors.\n\n00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:31.351\nNow a drone like this\n\n00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.557\nis meant to carry a useful payload,\n\n00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:35.340\nsuch as a video camera\n\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.328\nor a photographic camera.\n\n00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:40.677\nIt also requires a software that allows the user\n\n00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:42.378\nto program a mission,\n\n00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:44.784\nto tell the drone where to go.\n\n00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:46.861\nNow people I talk to are often surprised\n\n00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.192\nwhen they hear that these are the only\n\n00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:52.299\nfour components that make a conservation drone,\n\n00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.803\nbut they are even more surprised\n\n00:02:53.803 --> 00:02:57.303\nwhen I tell them how affordable\nthese components are.\n\n00:02:57.303 --> 00:02:59.589\nThe facts is, a conservation drone\n\n00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.848\ndoesn't cost very much more than\n\n00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.825\na good laptop computer\n\n00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:07.084\nor a decent pair of binoculars.\n\n00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:10.056\nSo now that you've built\nyour own conservation drone,\n\n00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.218\nyou probably want to go fly it,\n\n00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:14.151\nbut how does one fly a drone?\n\n00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:15.743\nWell, actually, you don't,\n\n00:03:15.743 --> 00:03:18.233\nbecause the drone flies itself.\n\n00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:21.363\nAll you have to do is to program a mission\n\n00:03:21.363 --> 00:03:23.623\nto tell the drone where to fly.\n\n00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:25.942\nBut you simply do that by clicking on\n\n00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:29.191\na few way points

just a few way points,\n\n00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:38.791\nor they could be slightly longer\nand more complicated,\n\n00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:41.212\nto fly along a river system.\n\n00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:45.061\nSometimes, we fly the drone\nin a lawnmower-type pattern\n\n00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.181\nand take pictures of that area,\n\n00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.152\nand those pictures can be processed\n\n00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:51.891\nto produce a map of that forest.\n\n00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.494\nOther researchers might want to fly the drone\n\n00:03:54.494 --> 00:03:56.636\nalong the boundaries of a forest\n\n00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.807\nto watch out for poachers or people\n\n00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.725\nwho might be trying to enter the forest illegally.\n\n00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:03.605\nNow whatever your mission is,\n\n00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:05.078\nonce you've programmed it,\n\n00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.061\nyou simply upload it to the autopilot system,\n\n00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:09.701\nbring your drone to the field,\n\n00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.916\nand launch it simply by tossing it in the air.\n\n00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:15.258\nAnd often we'll go about this mission\n\n00:04:15.258 --> 00:04:18.318\ntaking pictures or videos along the way,\n\n00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:20.252\nand usually at that point,\n\n00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:22.469\nwe will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,\n\n00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.399\nsit back, and relax for the next few minutes,\n\n00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.910\nalthough some of us sit back\nand panic for the next few minutes\n\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.128\nworrying that the drone will not return.\n\n00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:33.401\nUsually it does, and when it does,\n\n00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.807\nit even lands automatically.\n\n00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:39.714\nSo what can we do with a conservation drone?\n\n00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:43.107\nWell, when we built our first prototype drone,\n\n00:04:43.107 --> 00:04:45.625\nour main objective was to fly it over\n\n00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:49.514\na remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,\n\n00:04:49.514 --> 00:04:52.563\nto look for the nest of a species of great ape\n\n00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:54.719\nknown as the orangutan.\n\n00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.375\nThe reason we wanted to do that was because\n\n00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:59.404\nwe needed to know how many individuals\n\n00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:02.791\nof this species are still left in that forest.\n\n00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.977\nNow the traditional method of surveying\n\n00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:08.579\nfor orangutans is to walk the forest on foot\n\n00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.466\ncarrying heavy equipment\n\n00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:14.116\nand to use a pair of binoculars\nto look up in the treetops\n\n00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:17.534\nwhere you might find an orangutan or its nest.\n\n00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:19.260\nNow as you can imagine,\n\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.230\nthat is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,\n\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.948\nand costly process,\n\n00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.744\nso we were hoping that drones\n\n00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:29.069\ncould significantly reduce the cost of surveying\n\n00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.636\nfor orangutan populations in Indonesia\n\n00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:34.103\nand elsewhere in Southeast Asia.\n\n00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:36.458\nSo we were very excited when we captured\n\n00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:39.628\nour first pair of orangutan nests on camera.\n\n00:05:39.628 --> 00:05:42.792\nAnd this is it; this is the first ever picture\n\n00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:45.832\nof orangutan nests taken with a drone.\n\n00:05:45.832 --> 00:05:47.856\nSince then we have taken pictures\n\n00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:49.474\nof dozens of these nests\n\n00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.243\nfrom around various parts of Southeast Asia,\n\n00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:54.486\nand we're now working with computer scientists\n\n00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:58.405\nto develop algorithms that can automatically count\n\n00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:00.422\nthe number of nests from the thousands\n\n00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:03.541\nof photos we've collected so far.\n\n00:06:03.541 --> 00:06:05.499\nBut nests are not the only objects\n\n00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.289\nthese drones can detect.\n\n00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.598\nThis is a wild orangutan\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.119\nhappily feeding on top of a palm tree,\n\n00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:15.671\nseemingly oblivious to our drone\nthat was flying overhead,\n\n00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:18.055\nnot once but several times.\n\n00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:21.073\nWe've also taken pictures of other animals\n\n00:06:21.073 --> 00:06:24.194\nincluding forest buffalos in Gabon,\n\n00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:27.409\nelephants, and even turtle nests.\n\n00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.949\nBut besides taking pictures\nof just the animals themselves,\n\n00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.950\nwe also take pictures of the habitats\nthese animals live in,\n\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.564\nbecause we want to keep track\n\n00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:39.518\nof the health of these habitats.\n\n00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:41.737\nSometimes, we zoom out a little\n\n00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:43.990\nand look at other things that might be happening\n\n00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.454\nin the landscape.\n\n00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:48.754\nThis is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.\n\n00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:51.996\nNow oil palm is a major driver of deforestation\n\n00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:53.518\nin that part of the world,\n\n00:06:53.518 --> 00:06:56.575\nso we wanted to use this new drone technology\n\n00:06:56.575 --> 00:06:59.690\nto keep track of the spread of these plantations\n\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.700\nin Southeast Asia.\n\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.063\nBut drones could also be used to keep track of\n\n00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:06.547\nillegal logging activities.\n\n00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:08.988\nThis is a recently logged forest,\n\n00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:10.343\nagain in Sumatra.\n\n00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:12.502\nYou could even still see the processed\n\n00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:16.130\nwooden planks left on the ground.\n\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.419\nBut perhaps the most exciting part\n\n00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.985\nabout taking pictures from the air is\n\n00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:23.411\nwe could later stitch these pictures together\n\n00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:26.274\nusing special software to create a map\n\n00:07:26.274 --> 00:07:29.041\nof the entire landscape, and this map\n\n00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:31.056\ngives us crucial information\n\n00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:33.324\nfor monitoring land use change,\n\n00:07:33.324 --> 00:07:37.071\nto let us know where and when\nplantations might be expanding,\n\n00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.348\nwhere forests might be contracting,\n\n00:07:39.348 --> 00:07:42.730\nor where fires might be breaking out.\n\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.962\nAerial images could also be processed\n\n00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:47.271\nto produce three-dimensional\n\n00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:49.268\ncomputer models of forests.\n\n00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:52.221\nNow these models are not just visually appealing,\n\n00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:54.722\nbut they are also geometrically accurate,\n\n00:07:54.722 --> 00:07:57.499\nwhich means researchers can now measure\n\n00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:59.624\nthe distance between trees,\n\n00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:02.919\ncalculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,\n\n00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:06.118\nand so on, all of which are important information\n\n00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:09.431\nfor monitoring the health of these forests.\n\n00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:11.884\nRecently, we've also begun experimenting\n\n00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:13.948\nwith thermal imaging cameras.\n\n00:08:13.948 --> 00:08:15.837\nNow these cameras can detect\n\n00:08:15.837 --> 00:08:17.811\nheat-emitting objects from the ground,\n\n00:08:17.822 --> 00:08:25.194\nand therefore they are very useful\nfor detecting poachers or their campfires at night.\n\n00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:27.078\nSo I've told you quite a lot about\n\n00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:29.294\nwhat conservation drones are,\n\n00:08:29.294 --> 00:08:31.611\nhow you might operate one of these drones,\n\n00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.620\nand what a drone could do for you.\n\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.856\nI will now tell you where conservation drones\n\n00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:38.311\nare being used around the world.\n\n00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:41.364\nWe built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.\n\n00:08:41.364 --> 00:08:43.505\nWe brought a few of these to Indonesia\n\n00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.648\nfor the first few test flights.\n\n00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:47.463\nSince then, we've been building drones\n\n00:08:47.463 --> 00:08:50.145\nfor our collaborators from around the world,\n\n00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:52.325\nand these include fellow biologists\n\n00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:56.253\nand partners from major conservation organizations.\n\n00:08:56.253 --> 00:08:58.543\nPerhaps the best and most rewarding part\n\n00:08:58.543 --> 00:09:00.669\nabout working with these collaborators\n\n00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:02.149\nis the feedback they give us\n\n00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:04.792\non how to improve our drones.\n\n00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:06.923\nBuilding drones for us is\n\n00:09:06.923 --> 00:09:09.087\na constant work in progress.\n\n00:09:09.087 --> 00:09:12.164\nWe are constantly trying to improve them in terms of\n\n00:09:12.164 --> 00:09:14.778\ntheir range, their ruggedness,\n\n00:09:14.778 --> 00:09:17.456\nand the amount of payload they can carry.\n\n00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.498\nWe also work with collaborators\n\n00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:22.785\nto discover new ways of using these drones.\n\n00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:26.065\nFor example, camera traps are a common tool\n\n00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:29.960\nused by biologists to take pictures of shy animals\n\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.521\nhiding in the forests,\n\n00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:33.855\nbut these are motion-activated cameras,\n\n00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:36.496\nso they snap a picture every time an animal\n\n00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:38.168\ncrosses their path.\n\n00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:39.720\nBut the problem with camera traps\n\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.463\nis that the researcher has to go back to the forest\n\n00:09:43.463 --> 00:09:46.916\nevery so often to retrieve those images,\n\n00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:48.568\nand that takes a lot of time,\n\n00:09:48.568 --> 00:09:50.402\nespecially if there are dozens\n\n00:09:50.402 --> 00:09:53.530\nor hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.\n\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.341\nNow a drone could be designed to perform the task\n\n00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.065\nmuch more efficiently.\n\n00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.735\nThis drone, carrying a special sensor,\n\n00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:03.076\ncould be flown over the forest\n\n00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:05.823\nand remotely download these images\n\n00:10:05.823 --> 00:10:09.960\nfrom wi-fi\u2013enabled cameras.\n\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.097\nRadio collars are another tool\n\n00:10:12.097 --> 00:10:14.345\nthat's commonly used by biologists.\n\n00:10:14.345 --> 00:10:17.012\nNow these collars are put onto animals.\n\n00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:19.813\nThey transmit a radio signal which allows\n\n00:10:19.813 --> 00:10:24.960\nthe researcher to track the movements\nof these animals across the landscape.\n\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.617\nBut the traditional way of tracking animals\n\n00:10:27.617 --> 00:10:29.839\nis pretty ridiculous,\n\n00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.783\nbecause it requires the researcher to be walking\n\n00:10:32.783 --> 00:10:36.897\non the ground carrying a huge\nand cumbersome radio antenna,\n\n00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:39.770\nnot unlike those old TV antennae we used to have\n\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.738\non our rooftops. Some of us still do.\n\n00:10:42.738 --> 00:10:45.003\nA drone could be used to do the same job\n\n00:10:45.003 --> 00:10:46.662\nmuch more efficiently.\n\n00:10:46.662 --> 00:10:48.368\nWhy not equip a drone\n\n00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:50.371\nwith a scanning radio receiver,\n\n00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:52.365\nfly that over the forest canopy\n\n00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:53.903\nin a certain pattern\n\n00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.695\nwhich would allow the user or the operator\n\n00:10:56.695 --> 00:10:59.277\nto triangulate the location\n\n00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:02.264\nof these radio-collared animals remotely\n\n00:11:02.264 --> 00:11:05.237\nwithout having to step foot in the forest.\n\n00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:07.740\nA third and perhaps most exciting way\n\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.270\nof using these drones\n\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.220\nis to fly them to a really remote,\n\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.496\nnever-explored-before rainforest\n\n00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:16.320\nsomewhere hidden in the tropics,\n\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.253\nand parachute down a tiny spy microphone\n\n00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:22.699\nthat would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls\n\n00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:26.021\nof mammals, birds, amphibians,\n\n00:11:26.021 --> 00:11:30.298\nthe Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.\n\n00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:32.037\nThat would give us biologists\n\n00:11:32.037 --> 00:11:33.923\na pretty good idea of what animals\n\n00:11:33.923 --> 00:11:36.473\nmight be living in those forests.\n\n00:11:36.473 --> 00:11:38.522\nAnd finally, I would like to show you\n\n00:11:38.522 --> 00:11:41.623\nthe latest version of our conservation drone.\n\n00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:43.762\nThe MAJA drone has a wingspan\n\n00:11:43.762 --> 00:11:45.436\nof about two meters.\n\n00:11:45.436 --> 00:11:47.386\nIt weighs only about two kilograms,\n\n00:11:47.386 --> 00:11:49.847\nbut it can carry half its weight.\n\n00:11:49.847 --> 00:11:52.442\nIt is a fully autonomous system.\n\n00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:54.829\nDuring its mission, it can even transmit\n\n00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:58.792\na live video feed back to a ground station laptop,\n\n00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:00.335\nwhich allows the user\n\n00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:03.265\nto see what the drone is seeing in real time.\n\n00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:05.687\nIt carries a variety of sensors,\n\n00:12:05.687 --> 00:12:08.025\nand the photo quality of some of these sensors\n\n00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:12.235\ncan be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.\n\n00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:15.916\nThis drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,\n\n00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:19.040\nwhich gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.\n\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.955\nThat is quite sufficient for most\n\n00:12:20.955 --> 00:12:23.954\nof our conservation applications.\n\n00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:26.024\nNow, conservation drones began as\n\n00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:28.215\na crazy idea from two biologists\n\n00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:31.500\nwho are just deeply passionate\nabout this technology.\n\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.650\nAnd we believe, strongly believe,\n\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.997\nthat drones can and will be a game changer\n\n00:12:36.997 --> 00:12:40.031\nfor conservation research and applications.\n\n00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:43.206\nWe've had our fair share of skeptics and critics\n\n00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:46.727\nwho thought that we were just\nfooling around with toy planes.\n\n00:12:46.727 --> 00:12:48.153\nAnd in a way, they are right.\n\n00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:49.782\nI mean, let's be honest,\n\n00:12:49.782 --> 00:12:53.470\ndrones are the ultimate toys for boys.\n\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.876\nBut at the same time, we've also gotten to know\n\n00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:58.125\nmany wonderful colleagues and collaborators\n\n00:12:58.125 --> 00:12:59.673\nwho share our vision\n\n00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:02.529\nand see the potential of conservation drones.\n\n00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:06.128\nTo us, it is obvious that conservation biologists\n\n00:13:06.128 --> 00:13:08.386\nand practitioners should make full use\n\n00:13:08.386 --> 00:13:11.920\nof every available tool, including drones,\n\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.561\nin our fight to save the last remaining forests\n\n00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.348\nand wildlife of this planet.\n\n00:13:16.348 --> 00:13:18.346\nThank you.\n\n00:13:18.346 --> 00:13:24.068\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Ecology from the air", "duration": "830", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/greg_asner_ecology_from_the_air", "transcript": "Technology can change our understanding of nature.Take for example the case of lions. For centuries, it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna, and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner. You've heard this too, I can tell. Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions, and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air. The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill, and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation. And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances, usually during the day, male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation, and often at night. This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation, and the white are wide open spaces. And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting.I bring up this example to begin, because it emphasizes how little we know about nature. There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests, and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate, as shown in red on the slide. I find it ironic that we're doing so much, yet these areas are fairly unknown to science. So how can we save what we don't understand?Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects, but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet. So I created this, the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO. It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job, but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos of high-tech sensors, computers, and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. Two of our instruments are very unique: one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. Another one is a set of lasers, very high-powered lasers, that fire out of the bottom of the plane, sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second in high-resolution 3D. Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, not far from where I live. Although we flew straight over this bridge, we imaged it in 3D, captured its color in just a few seconds. But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems. This is a small town in the Amazon, imaged with the CAO. We can slice through our data and see, for example, the 3D structure of the vegetation and the buildings, or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them. The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants. And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined. This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. This is how we see a rainforest, in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales, and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological, and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy, but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest.Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point, such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors. I want to share three of those questions with you today. The first questions is, how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests? Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees, and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately, global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. That's all ships, airplanes, trains  and automobiles combined. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation, but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science. If you don't know where the carbon is exactly, in detail, how can you know what you're losing? Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system. With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows, obviously, closed-canopy tropical forest, and then you see the cookie cutting, or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens. It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time. And what's amazing is, even though we flew very high above this forest, later on in analysis, we can go in and actually experience the treetrops, leaf by leaf, branch by branch, just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves.We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not-so-faraway places like the United States and Central America. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high-resolution, first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama. The colors are going to be going from red to blue. Red is extremely high carbon stocks, your largest cathedral forests you can imagine, and blue are very low carbon stocks. And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place, totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today. We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red, and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue, and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange. We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system. And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon. It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's \"Avatar.\" We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries, Panama, and see also a huge range of carbon variation, from high in red to low in blue. Unfortunately, most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands, but what you see that's left, in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds, is the stuff that's up in the mountains. One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen. You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal. That's in the reds and yellows. The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce. This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change.My second question: How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest? Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time in these places, and we're seeing the climate changing already. Temperatures are increasing, and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts, recurring droughts. The 2010 mega-drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe. The Amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially, as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. What we found is that in very remote areas, these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. For example, these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought. This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil, totally unexplored, almost totally unknown scientifically.So what we think, as Earth scientists, is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change. One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak. Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners. You see the forest in green in 3D, and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this, obviously.If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go. It's an amazing experience every time, no matter where you go. You're going to probably see it this way, on a river. But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself. We flew over this same river, imaged the system in 3D. The forest is on the left. And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy. And in this case, we found gold mining activity, all of it illegal, set back away from the river's edge, as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. Don't worry, we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many, many other problems in the region.So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique, important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor, we have to start making geographically explicit plans now. How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region, if it's so unknown to science? So what we've been doing is using the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. Reds are one type of species, blues are another, and greens are yet another. And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level, we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work. This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat, and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans.And third and final question is, how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems? The example I started out with about lions hunting, that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. And the truth is, much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. For example, how much and where to use fire as a management tool? Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants, which may, if their populations get too large, have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. And let me tell you, these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants: wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees. As we cross this fence line, now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants: dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem. And in a place like Kruger, the soaring elephant densities are a real problem. I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you, and there are no easy answers with this. But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa, for example, is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna, and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants, in the red as you see on the screen, and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. So really, the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life, where we have fire management, elephant management, those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem, and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions.Going forward, I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory. I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this. Until then, you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet, but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1874,

example the case of lions.\n\n00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.972\nFor centuries, it's been said that female lions\n\n00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:24.701\ndo all of the hunting out in the open savanna,\n\n00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.682\nand male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.\n\n00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.694\nYou've heard this too, I can tell.\n\n00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:34.280\nWell recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign\n\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.952\nin the Kruger National Park in South Africa.\n\n00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:39.544\nOur colleagues put GPS tracking collars\n\n00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:41.141\non male and female lions,\n\n00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.749\nand we mapped their hunting behavior\n\n00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.197\nfrom the air.\n\n00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:46.863\nThe lower left shows a lion sizing up\n\n00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:48.875\na herd of impala for a kill,\n\n00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.444\nand the right shows what I call\n\n00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:52.307\nthe lion viewshed.\n\n00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:54.929\nThat's how far the lion can see in all directions\n\n00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.104\nuntil his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.\n\n00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:00.545\nAnd what we found\n\n00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.051\nis that male lions are not the lazy hunters\n\n00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:04.575\nwe thought them to be.\n\n00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.712\nThey just use a different strategy.\n\n00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.464\nWhereas the female lions hunt\n\n00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:09.596\nout in the open savanna\n\n00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:12.257\nover long distances, usually during the day,\n\n00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:15.267\nmale lions use an ambush strategy\n\n00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:19.000\nin dense vegetation, and often at night.\n\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.006\nThis video shows the actual hunting viewsheds\n\n00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:23.871\nof male lions on the left\n\n00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:25.860\nand females on the right.\n\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.416\nRed and darker colors show more dense vegetation,\n\n00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:30.531\nand the white are wide open spaces.\n\n00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.631\nAnd this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level\n\n00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:36.161\nof hunting male and female lions.\n\n00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:38.490\nAll of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding\n\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.343\nof the very spooky conditions under which\n\n00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:43.423\nmale lions do their hunting.\n\n00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:44.919\nI bring up this example to begin,\n\n00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:49.387\nbecause it emphasizes how little\nwe know about nature.\n\n00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:52.062\nThere's been a huge amount of work done so far\n\n00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:55.690\nto try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,\n\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.639\nand we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,\n\n00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.553\nas shown in red on the slide.\n\n00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.893\nI find it ironic that we're doing so much,\n\n00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:05.526\nyet these areas are fairly unknown to science.\n\n00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:08.183\nSo how can we save what we don't understand?\n\n00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:10.845\nNow I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer\n\n00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:12.536\nwith a background in physics and chemistry\n\n00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:15.740\nand biology and a lot of other boring subjects,\n\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.742\nbut above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know\n\n00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:20.454\nabout our planet.\n\n00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:22.128\nSo I created this,\n\n00:02:22.128 --> 00:02:25.405\nthe Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.\n\n00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.462\nIt may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,\n\n00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:30.222\nbut I packed it with over 1,000 kilos\n\n00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:32.658\nof high-tech sensors, computers,\n\n00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:34.869\nand a very motivated staff\n\n00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.338\nof Earth scientists and pilots.\n\n00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:39.198\nTwo of our instruments are very unique:\n\n00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:40.952\none is called an imaging spectrometer\n\n00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.814\nthat can actually measure the chemical composition\n\n00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:45.743\nof plants as we fly over them.\n\n00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:47.669\nAnother one is a set of lasers,\n\n00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.400\nvery high-powered lasers,\n\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.360\nthat fire out of the bottom of the plane,\n\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.232\nsweeping across the ecosystem\n\n00:02:53.232 --> 00:02:57.329\nand measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second\n\n00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.807\nin high-resolution 3D.\n\n00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:01.791\nHere's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge\n\n00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:03.963\nin San Francisco, not far from where I live.\n\n00:03:03.963 --> 00:03:05.766\nAlthough we flew straight over this bridge,\n\n00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.422\nwe imaged it in 3D, captured its color\n\n00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:09.469\nin just a few seconds.\n\n00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.564\nBut the real power of the CAO\n\n00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.739\nis its ability to capture the actual building blocks\n\n00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.508\nof ecosystems.\n\n00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:17.207\nThis is a small town in the Amazon,\n\n00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:18.822\nimaged with the CAO.\n\n00:03:18.822 --> 00:03:20.561\nWe can slice through our data\n\n00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:22.825\nand see, for example, the 3D structure\n\n00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:25.158\nof the vegetation and the buildings,\n\n00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:27.067\nor we can use the chemical information\n\n00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:29.798\nto actually figure out how fast the plants are growing\n\n00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:31.141\nas we fly over them.\n\n00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:34.627\nThe hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.\n\n00:03:34.627 --> 00:03:36.544\nAnd we can see biodiversity in ways\n\n00:03:36.544 --> 00:03:38.703\nthat you never could have imagined.\n\n00:03:38.703 --> 00:03:40.254\nThis is what a rainforest might look like\n\n00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:42.461\nas you fly over it in a hot air balloon.\n\n00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.555\nThis is how we see a rainforest,\n\n00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.900\nin kaleidoscopic color that tells us\n\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.842\nthat there are many species living with one another.\n\n00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:51.766\nBut you have to remember that these trees\n\n00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:54.062\nare literally bigger than whales,\n\n00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:56.974\nand what that means is that\nthey're impossible to understand\n\n00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:59.949\njust by walking on the ground below them.\n\n00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:04.587\nSo our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,\n\n00:04:04.587 --> 00:04:06.345\nand this tells us not only the species\n\n00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.229\nthat are living in the canopy,\n\n00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.149\nbut it tells us a lot of information\n\n00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.725\nabout the rest of the species\nthat occupy the rainforest.\n\n00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:15.856\nNow I created the CAO\n\n00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.995\nin order to answer questions that have proven\n\n00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:21.347\nextremely challenging to answer\nfrom any other vantage point,\n\n00:04:21.347 --> 00:04:24.224\nsuch as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.\n\n00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:27.461\nI want to share three of those\nquestions with you today.\n\n00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:29.168\nThe first questions is,\n\n00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.897\nhow do we manage our carbon reserves\n\n00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:33.653\nin tropical forests?\n\n00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:37.212\nTropical forests contain a huge\namount of carbon in the trees,\n\n00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:39.626\nand we need to keep that carbon in those forests\n\n00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:43.040\nif we're going to avoid any further global warming.\n\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.266\nUnfortunately, global carbon emissions\n\n00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.029\nfrom deforestation\n\n00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.204\nnow equals the global transportation sector.\n\n00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:54.507\nThat's all ships, airplanes, trains \nand automobiles combined.\n\n00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:57.598\nSo it's understandable that policy negotiators\n\n00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.086\nhave been working hard to reduce deforestation,\n\n00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:01.957\nbut they're doing it on landscapes\n\n00:05:01.957 --> 00:05:04.096\nthat are hardly known to science.\n\n00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.457\nIf you don't know where the carbon is exactly,\n\n00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.309\nin detail, how can you know what you're losing?\n\n00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.366\nBasically, we need a high-tech accounting system.\n\n00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:15.682\nWith our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks\n\n00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.480\nof tropical forests in utter detail.\n\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.335\nThe red shows, obviously,\nclosed-canopy tropical forest,\n\n00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:23.353\nand then you see the cookie cutting,\n\n00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:27.260\nor the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.\n\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.083\nIt's like cutting a cake except this cake\n\n00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:32.282\nis about whale deep.\n\n00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:34.250\nAnd yet, we can zoom in and see the forest\n\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.263\nand the trees at the same time.\n\n00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:38.465\nAnd what's amazing is, even though we flew\n\n00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.742\nvery high above this forest,\n\n00:05:40.742 --> 00:05:42.645\nlater on in analysis, we can go in\n\n00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:44.865\nand actually experience the treetrops,\n\n00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:47.212\nleaf by leaf, branch by branch,\n\n00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:50.719\njust as the other species that live in this forest\n\n00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.536\nexperience it along with the trees themselves.\n\n00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:55.702\nWe've been using the technology to explore\n\n00:05:55.702 --> 00:05:58.572\nand to actually put out the first carbon geographies\n\n00:05:58.572 --> 00:06:00.186\nin high resolution\n\n00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.432\nin faraway places like the Amazon Basin\n\n00:06:02.432 --> 00:06:04.719\nand not-so-faraway places like the United States\n\n00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:06.452\nand Central America.\n\n00:06:06.452 --> 00:06:09.952\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to take you\non a high-resolution, first-time tour\n\n00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.881\nof the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.\n\n00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.643\nThe colors are going to be going from red to blue.\n\n00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.637\nRed is extremely high carbon stocks,\n\n00:06:18.637 --> 00:06:21.176\nyour largest cathedral forests you can imagine,\n\n00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:23.418\nand blue are very low carbon stocks.\n\n00:06:23.418 --> 00:06:25.852\nAnd let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,\n\n00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:28.241\ntotally unknown in terms of its carbon geography\n\n00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:29.827\nuntil today.\n\n00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:31.673\nWe can fly to this area in northern Peru\n\n00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:33.809\nand see super high carbon stocks in red,\n\n00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:35.298\nand the Amazon River and floodplain\n\n00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:37.043\ncutting right through it.\n\n00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:38.941\nWe can go to an area of utter devastation\n\n00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:40.776\ncaused by deforestation in blue,\n\n00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:44.218\nand the virus of deforestation\nspreading out in orange.\n\n00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:46.902\nWe can also fly to the southern Andes\n\n00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:48.752\nto see the tree line and see exactly how\n\n00:06:48.752 --> 00:06:50.668\nthe carbon geography ends\n\n00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:53.374\nas we go up into the mountain system.\n\n00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:56.279\nAnd we can go to the biggest swamp\nin the western Amazon.\n\n00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.652\nIt's a watery dreamworld\n\n00:06:57.652 --> 00:06:59.998\nakin to Jim Cameron's \"Avatar.\"\n\n00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:03.302\nWe can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,\n\n00:07:03.302 --> 00:07:05.659\nPanama, and see also a huge range\n\n00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.221\nof carbon variation,\n\n00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.222\nfrom high in red to low in blue.\n\n00:07:09.222 --> 00:07:12.154\nUnfortunately, most of the carbon\nis lost in the lowlands,\n\n00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:13.700\nbut what you see that's left,\n\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.433\nin terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,\n\n00:07:16.433 --> 00:07:18.547\nis the stuff that's up in the mountains.\n\n00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:20.905\nOne interesting exception to this\n\n00:07:20.905 --> 00:07:22.521\nis right in the middle of your screen.\n\n00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.165\nYou're seeing the buffer zone\naround the Panama Canal.\n\n00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:27.078\nThat's in the reds and yellows.\n\n00:07:27.078 --> 00:07:28.818\nThe canal authorities are using force\n\n00:07:28.818 --> 00:07:31.933\nto protect their watershed and global commerce.\n\n00:07:31.933 --> 00:07:33.423\nThis kind of carbon mapping\n\n00:07:33.423 --> 00:07:35.341\nhas transformed conservation\n\n00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:36.937\nand resource policy development.\n\n00:07:36.937 --> 00:07:39.297\nIt's really advancing our ability to save forests\n\n00:07:39.297 --> 00:07:41.672\nand to curb climate change.\n\n00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:45.103\nMy second question: How do we\nprepare for climate change\n\n00:07:45.103 --> 00:07:47.249\nin a place like the Amazon rainforest?\n\n00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.902\nLet me tell you, I spend a lot of time\n\n00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:52.127\nin these places, and we're seeing\nthe climate changing already.\n\n00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:53.739\nTemperatures are increasing,\n\n00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:56.371\nand what's really happening is\nwe're getting a lot of droughts,\n\n00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:58.028\nrecurring droughts.\n\n00:07:58.028 --> 00:07:59.845\nThe 2010 mega-drought is shown here\n\n00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:03.295\nwith red showing an area\nabout the size of Western Europe.\n\n00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:05.557\nThe Amazon was so dry in 2010\n\n00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:07.959\nthat even the main stem of the Amazon river itself\n\n00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:10.093\ndried up partially, as you see in the photo\n\n00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:13.514\nin the lower portion of the slide.\n\n00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:16.684\nWhat we found is that in very remote areas,\n\n00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:19.430\nthese droughts are having a big negative impact\n\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.018\non tropical forests.\n\n00:08:21.018 --> 00:08:23.738\nFor example, these are all of the dead trees in red\n\n00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:26.799\nthat suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.\n\n00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:28.676\nThis area happens to be on the border\n\n00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:30.075\nof Peru and Brazil,\n\n00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:31.611\ntotally unexplored,\n\n00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.414\nalmost totally unknown scientifically.\n\n00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:36.880\nSo what we think, as Earth scientists,\n\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.839\nis species are going to have to migrate\n\n00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.631\nwith climate change from the east in Brazil\n\n00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:43.695\nall the way west into the Andes\n\n00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:45.168\nand up into the mountains\n\n00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:48.704\nin order to minimize their\nexposure to climate change.\n\n00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:50.712\nOne of the problems with this is that humans\n\n00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:53.737\nare taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.\n\n00:08:53.737 --> 00:08:55.846\nLook at this 100-square-kilometer gash\n\n00:08:55.846 --> 00:08:58.748\nin the forest created by gold miners.\n\n00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.026\nYou see the forest in green in 3D,\n\n00:09:01.026 --> 00:09:02.860\nand you see the effects of gold mining\n\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.399\ndown below the soil surface.\n\n00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:09.858\nSpecies have nowhere to migrate\nin a system like this, obviously.\n\n00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:12.510\nIf you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.\n\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.548\nIt's an amazing experience every time,\n\n00:09:14.548 --> 00:09:16.091\nno matter where you go.\n\n00:09:16.091 --> 00:09:19.487\nYou're going to probably see it this way, on a river.\n\n00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:21.251\nBut what happens is a lot of times\n\n00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:23.103\nthe rivers hide what's really going on\n\n00:09:23.103 --> 00:09:25.868\nback in the forest itself.\n\n00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:27.582\nWe flew over this same river,\n\n00:09:27.582 --> 00:09:29.422\nimaged the system in 3D.\n\n00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:31.238\nThe forest is on the left.\n\n00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:33.224\nAnd then we can digitally remove the forest\n\n00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:35.683\nand see what's going on below the canopy.\n\n00:09:35.683 --> 00:09:38.133\nAnd in this case, we found gold mining activity,\n\n00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:39.370\nall of it illegal,\n\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.566\nset back away from the river's edge,\n\n00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:43.470\nas you'll see in those strange pockmarks\n\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.497\ncoming up on your screen on the right.\n\n00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:47.826\nDon't worry, we're working with the authorities\n\n00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:50.277\nto deal with this and many, many other problems\n\n00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:52.887\nin the region.\n\n00:09:52.887 --> 00:09:55.942\nSo in order to put together a conservation plan\n\n00:09:55.942 --> 00:09:57.682\nfor these unique, important corridors\n\n00:09:57.682 --> 00:10:00.669\nlike the western Amazon\nand the Andes Amazon corridor,\n\n00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:02.833\nwe have to start making\n\n00:10:02.833 --> 00:10:05.239\ngeographically explicit plans now.\n\n00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:09.216\nHow do we do that if we don't know\nthe geography of biodiversity in the region,\n\n00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:10.911\nif it's so unknown to science?\n\n00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.775\nSo what we've been doing is using\n\n00:10:12.775 --> 00:10:15.748\nthe laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO\n\n00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.972\nto map for the first time the biodiversity\n\n00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:19.551\nof the Amazon rainforest.\n\n00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:23.088\nHere you see actual data showing\ndifferent species in different colors.\n\n00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:25.228\nReds are one type of species, blues are another,\n\n00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:27.573\nand greens are yet another.\n\n00:10:27.573 --> 00:10:29.736\nAnd when we take this together and scale up\n\n00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.620\nto the regional level,\n\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.189\nwe get a completely new geography\n\n00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:38.577\nof biodiversity unknown prior to this work.\n\n00:10:38.577 --> 00:10:40.725\nThis tells us where the big biodiversity changes\n\n00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:42.739\noccur from habitat to habitat,\n\n00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:44.922\nand that's really important because it tells us\n\n00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:47.817\na lot about where species may migrate to\n\n00:10:47.817 --> 00:10:50.700\nand migrate from as the climate shifts.\n\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.922\nAnd this is the pivotal information that's needed\n\n00:10:53.922 --> 00:10:57.430\nby decision makers to develop protected areas\n\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.849\nin the context of their regional development plans.\n\n00:11:00.849 --> 00:11:02.746\nAnd third and final question is,\n\n00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.854\nhow do we manage biodiversity on a planet\n\n00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:06.832\nof protected ecosystems?\n\n00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.583\nThe example I started out\nwith about lions hunting,\n\n00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:11.438\nthat was a study we did\n\n00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.430\nbehind the fence line of a protected area\n\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.162\nin South Africa.\n\n00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:17.160\nAnd the truth is, much of Africa's nature\n\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.075\nis going to persist into the future\n\n00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:22.321\nin protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.\n\n00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:24.797\nThis puts incredible pressure and responsibility\n\n00:11:24.797 --> 00:11:26.416\non park management.\n\n00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:29.033\nThey need to do and make decisions\n\n00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:32.324\nthat will benefit all of the species\nthat they're protecting.\n\n00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:35.393\nSome of their decisions have really big impacts.\n\n00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:37.469\nFor example, how much and where\n\n00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:40.109\nto use fire as a management tool?\n\n00:11:40.109 --> 00:11:43.334\nOr, how to deal with a large species like elephants,\n\n00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:45.787\nwhich may, if their populations get too large,\n\n00:11:45.787 --> 00:11:47.834\nhave a negative impact on the ecosystem\n\n00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:49.436\nand on other species.\n\n00:11:49.436 --> 00:11:51.929\nAnd let me tell you, these types of dynamics\n\n00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:53.877\nreally play out on the landscape.\n\n00:11:53.877 --> 00:11:56.338\nIn the foreground is an area with lots of fire\n\n00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:57.605\nand lots of elephants:\n\n00:11:57.605 --> 00:12:01.281\nwide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.\n\n00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:03.462\nAs we cross this fence line, now we're getting\n\n00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:05.786\ninto an area that has had protection from fire\n\n00:12:05.786 --> 00:12:07.643\nand zero elephants:\n\n00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.801\ndense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.\n\n00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.191\nAnd in a place like Kruger,\n\n00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:15.932\nthe soaring elephant densities\n\n00:12:15.932 --> 00:12:17.675\nare a real problem.\n\n00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:20.039\nI know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,\n\n00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.699\nand there are no easy answers with this.\n\n00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:25.015\nBut what's good is that\nthe technology we've developed\n\n00:12:25.015 --> 00:12:27.487\nand we're working with in South Africa, for example,\n\n00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:30.843\nis allowing us to map every\nsingle tree in the savanna,\n\n00:12:30.843 --> 00:12:32.412\nand then through repeat flights\n\n00:12:32.412 --> 00:12:34.158\nwe're able to see which trees\n\n00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:36.188\nare being pushed over by elephants,\n\n00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:39.446\nin the red as you see on the screen,\nand how much that's happening\n\n00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:41.983\nin different types of landscapes in the savanna.\n\n00:12:41.983 --> 00:12:43.624\nThat's giving park managers\n\n00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:45.987\na very first opportunity to use\n\n00:12:45.987 --> 00:12:49.329\ntactical management strategies\nthat are more nuanced\n\n00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:53.151\nand don't lead to those extremes\nthat I just showed you.\n\n00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.863\nSo really, the way we're looking\n\n00:12:56.863 --> 00:12:58.904\nat protected areas nowadays\n\n00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:01.792\nis to think of it as tending to a circle of life,\n\n00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:03.840\nwhere we have fire management,\n\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.974\nelephant management, those impacts on\nthe structure of the ecosystem,\n\n00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:09.964\nand then those impacts\n\n00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:12.270\naffecting everything from insects\n\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.070\nup to apex predators like lions.\n\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.835\nGoing forward, I plan to greatly expand\n\n00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:18.563\nthe airborne observatory.\n\n00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:20.730\nI'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit\n\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.413\nso we can manage the entire planet\n\n00:13:22.413 --> 00:13:24.146\nwith technologies like this.\n\n00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:25.995\nUntil then, you're going to find me flying\n\n00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:28.498\nin some remote place that you've never heard of.\n\n00:13:28.498 --> 00:13:31.040\nI just want to end by saying that technology is\n\n00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.779\nabsolutely critical to managing our planet,\n\n00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.878\nbut even more important is the understanding\n\n00:13:36.878 --> 00:13:38.610\nand wisdom to apply it.\n\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.709\nThank you.\n\n00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:44.786\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Meet the robots for

Mr. Henry Evans.(Applause)Henry Evans: Hello. My name is Henry Evans, and until August 29, 2002, I was living my version of the American dream. I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a homemaker. My six siblings and I were good kids, but caused our fair share of trouble. After high school, I left home to study and learn more about the world. I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German, including spending a year of study in Austria. Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford. I married my high school sweetheart, Jane. I am lucky to have her. Together, we raised four wonderful children. I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed. My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13, 2001, a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills, California, from where I am speaking to you now.We were looking forward to rebuilding it, but eight months after we moved in, I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect. Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40. It took me several years, but with the help of an incredibly supportive family, I finally decided life was still worth living. I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements, and enable my use of a regular computer. I can surf the web, exchange email with people, and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged, mentally active, and feel like I am a part of the world.One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN, when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot. I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage, and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. For about two years, Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR2 as my body surrogate. I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years. From my home in California, I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter) I handed out Halloween candy. I opened my refrigerator on my own. I began doing tasks around the house. I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute, both for myself and others in my circumstance.All of us have disabilities in one form or another. For example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour, both of us will need an assistive device called a car. Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person, and neither does mine. By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter) Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own.Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins. Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight, giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head, these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. With a little practice, I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. I went even further by seeing if I could use a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift, as modified by Fighting Walrus, to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chad's group at Brown, I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week, from my home 3,000 miles away. All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic, so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer. (Laughter) I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside, I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away.(Applause)Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?(Laughter)Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?(Laughter) (Applause)Can you show us how excited you are?(Laughter)All right, big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are?(Applause)All right, we still have a little ways to go with that, but I think it shows the promise.What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs, understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology, and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide, and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What we're trying to do is democratize robotics, so that anybody can be a part of this. We're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars, the Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars, along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. And our hope is that, by providing these tools, that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled, to provide care for our aging population, to help better educate our children, to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future, to both monitor and protect our environment, and to explore the universe.Back to you, Henry.HE: Thank you, Chad.With this drone setup, we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world, and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination, where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else, and perhaps better, and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable. Actually, that's not true. I would have died.It is up to us, all of us, to decide how robotics will be used, for good or for evil, for simply replacing people or for making people better, for allowing us to do and enjoy more.Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe. With the help of people like you, we can make this dream a reality.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1875, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.251\nSarge Salman: All the way from\nLos Altos Hills, California,\n\n00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:17.312\nMr. Henry Evans.\n\n00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:21.204\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.063\nHenry Evans: Hello.\n\n00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:35.918\nMy name is Henry Evans,\n\n00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:39.509\nand until August 29, 2002,\n\n00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:44.533\nI was living my version of the American dream.\n\n00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:49.031\nI grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.\n\n00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:50.886\nMy dad was a lawyer.\n\n00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:53.875\nMy mom was a homemaker.\n\n00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:56.326\nMy six siblings and I were good kids,\n\n00:00:56.326 --> 00:00:59.818\nbut caused our fair share of trouble.\n\n00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:02.208\nAfter high school, I left home to study\n\n00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:05.111\nand learn more about the world.\n\n00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:07.768\nI went to Notre Dame University\n\n00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:11.314\nand graduated with degrees\nin accounting and German,\n\n00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:14.258\nincluding spending a year of study in Austria.\n\n00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:19.139\nLater on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.\n\n00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:23.151\nI married my high school sweetheart, Jane.\n\n00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.513\nI am lucky to have her.\n\n00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:30.158\nTogether, we raised four wonderful children.\n\n00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:33.239\nI worked and studied hard\nto move up the career ladder,\n\n00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.634\neventually becoming a chief financial officer\n\n00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:40.434\nin Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.\n\n00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:43.211\nMy family and I bought our first and only home\n\n00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:47.047\non December 13, 2001,\n\n00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:49.256\na fixer-upper in a beautiful spot\n\n00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:51.696\nof Los Altos Hills, California,\n\n00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.932\nfrom where I am speaking to you now.\n\n00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:57.542\nWe were looking forward to rebuilding it,\n\n00:01:57.542 --> 00:01:59.777\nbut eight months after we moved in,\n\n00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:04.169\nI suffered a stroke-like attack\ncaused by a birth defect.\n\n00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:09.108\nOvernight, I became a mute quadriplegic\n\n00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:12.451\nat the ripe old age of 40.\n\n00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.604\nIt took me several years,\n\n00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:18.173\nbut with the help of an incredibly supportive family,\n\n00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:23.032\nI finally decided life was still worth living.\n\n00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:25.577\nI became fascinated with using technology\n\n00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:30.001\nto help the severely disabled.\n\n00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.523\nHead tracking devices sold commercially\n\n00:02:32.523 --> 00:02:35.274\nby the company Madentec\n\n00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:39.132\nconvert my tiny head movements\ninto cursor movements,\n\n00:02:39.132 --> 00:02:43.418\nand enable my use of a regular computer.\n\n00:02:43.418 --> 00:02:46.677\nI can surf the web, exchange email with people,\n\n00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:49.605\nand routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins\n\n00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.722\nin online word games.\n\n00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:54.608\nThis technology allows me to remain engaged,\n\n00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:55.961\nmentally active,\n\n00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:59.712\nand feel like I am a part of the world.\n\n00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.017\nOne day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,\n\n00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:05.603\nwhen I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp\n\n00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:08.354\nof the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech\n\n00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.198\ndemonstrating a PR2 robot.\n\n00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:15.245\nI emailed Charlie and\nSteve Cousins of Willow Garage,\n\n00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:20.097\nand we formed the Robots for Humanity project.\n\n00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:22.998\nFor about two years, Robots for Humanity\n\n00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:25.379\ndeveloped ways for me to use the PR2\n\n00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.759\nas my body surrogate.\n\n00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:33.852\nI shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.\n\n00:03:33.852 --> 00:03:35.626\nFrom my home in California,\n\n00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:39.605\nI shaved Charlie in Atlanta.

One billion people. One seventh of the Earth's population are totally cut off for some part of the year. We cannot get medicine to them reliably, they cannot get critical supplies, and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, 85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season. Investments are being made, but at the current level, it's estimated it's going to take them 50 years to catch up. In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million miles of roads, very expensive to build, very expensive to maintain infrastructure, with a huge ecological footprint, and yet, very often, congested.So we saw this and we thought, can there be a better way? Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephones in the last 10 years? Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground. Could we do the same for transportation?Imagine this scenario. Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali, and have a newborn in need of urgent medication. What would you do today? Well, you would place a request via mobile phone, and someone would get the request immediately. That's the part that works. The medication may take days to arrive, though, because of bad roads. That's the part that's broken.We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this. This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms, over a short distance, about 10 kilometers, but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country, maybe even the entire continent. It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network. It's a network for a transportation of matter. We call it Matternet.We use three key technologies. The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles. The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther, or pick up or deliver loads. And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network.Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail. First of all, the UAVs. Eventually, we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges. Today, we're using small quads. These are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes. Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world, or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country. These fly autonomously. This is the key to the technology. So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations. Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism, so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations, they dock, swap a battery automatically, and go out again. The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground. They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission, which is the landing. They are at known locations on the ground, so the paths between them are also known, which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network. Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles, eventually they're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network. The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network. It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions, avoid other risk factors, and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network.I want to show you what one of those flights looks like. Here we are flying in Haiti last summer, where we've done our first field trials. We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake. People there love this.And I want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close. So this is a $3,000 vehicle. Costs are coming down very rapidly. We use this in all sorts of weather conditions, very hot and very cold climates, very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles. Imagine if your life depended on this package, somewhere in Africa or in New York City, after Sandy. The next big question is, what's the cost?Well, it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle is just 24 cents.(Applause)And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today, and we're just at the beginning of this. When we saw this, we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world.So we said, okay, how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world? And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples. The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed? And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers? That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars. Compare this to normal infrastructure investments. We think this can be \u2014 this is the power of a new paradigm.So here we are: a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet. It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint. If it is a new paradigm, though, there must be other uses for it. It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.So let's look at the other end of the spectrum: our cities and megacities. Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today. Half a billion of us live in megacities. We are living through an amazing urbanization trend. China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years. These are places that do have road infrastructure, but it's very inefficient. Congestion is a huge problem. So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet, initially for lightweight, urgent stuff, and over time, we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem. It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint, operating in the background 24/7, just like the Internet.So when we started this a couple of years ago now, we've had a lot of people come up to us who said, \"This is a very interesting but crazy idea, and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon.\" And of course, we're talking about drones, right, a technology that's not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very, very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries, especially those engaged in conflict.So why are we doing this? Well, we chose to do this one not because it's easy, but because it can have amazing impact. Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information. Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter. In the developing world, we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines, reach them with better medication. It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics. Over time, we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions, lifting millions of people out of poverty. In the developed world and the emerging world, we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable.So for those that still believe that this is science fiction, I firmly say to you that it is not. We do need to engage, though, in social fiction to make it happen.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1876, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.004 -->

00:07:03.198\nThese are places that do have road infrastructure,\n\n00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:05.512\nbut it's very inefficient.\n\n00:07:05.512 --> 00:07:07.644\nCongestion is a huge problem.\n\n00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:09.584\nSo we think it makes sense in those places\n\n00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:11.954\nto set up a network of transportation\n\n00:07:11.954 --> 00:07:14.120\nthat is a new layer that sits between the road\n\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.391\nand the Internet,\n\n00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:18.297\ninitially for lightweight, urgent stuff,\n\n00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:20.346\nand over time, we would hope to develop this\n\n00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:22.338\ninto a new mode of transportation\n\n00:07:22.338 --> 00:07:25.790\nthat is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.\n\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.344\nIt's ultimately scalable\n\n00:07:27.344 --> 00:07:30.202\nwith a very small ecological footprint,\n\n00:07:30.202 --> 00:07:33.178\noperating in the background 24/7,\n\n00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:35.524\njust like the Internet.\n\n00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:37.946\nSo when we started this\n\n00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:40.948\na couple of years ago now,\n\n00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:43.292\nwe've had a lot of people come up to us who said,\n\n00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:46.124\n\"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,\n\n00:07:46.124 --> 00:07:47.958\nand certainly not something that you should\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.672\nengage with anytime soon.\"\n\n00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:52.815\nAnd of course, we're talking about drones, right,\n\n00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:56.517\na technology that's not only unpopular in the West\n\n00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.465\nbut one that has become a very, very unpleasant\n\n00:07:58.465 --> 00:08:01.330\nfact of life for many living in poor countries,\n\n00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.141\nespecially those engaged in conflict.\n\n00:08:04.141 --> 00:08:08.675\nSo why are we doing this?\n\n00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:11.459\nWell, we chose to do this one\n\n00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:13.245\nnot because it's easy,\n\n00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:16.080\nbut because it can have amazing impact.\n\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.905\nImagine one billion people being connected\n\n00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:21.300\nto physical goods in the same way\n\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.324\nthat mobile telecommunications connected them\n\n00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:26.416\nto information.\n\n00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:30.156\nImagine if the next big network we built in the world\n\n00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:33.919\nwas a network for the transportation of matter.\n\n00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.321\nIn the developing world, we would hope\n\n00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:39.026\nto reach millions of people with better vaccines,\n\n00:08:39.026 --> 00:08:40.910\nreach them with better medication.\n\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.768\nIt would give us an unfair advantage against battling\n\n00:08:42.768 --> 00:08:46.760\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.\n\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.456\nOver time, we would hope it would become\n\n00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.630\na new platform for economic transactions,\n\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.091\nlifting millions of people out of poverty.\n\n00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:55.301\nIn the developed world and the emerging world,\n\n00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:56.769\nwe would hope it would become a new mode\n\n00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:00.490\nof transportation that could help make our cities\n\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.343\nmore livable.\n\n00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:05.686\nSo for those that still believe\nthat this is science fiction,\n\n00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:08.501\nI firmly say to you that it is not.\n\n00:09:08.501 --> 00:09:10.170\nWe do need to engage, though,\n\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.238\nin social fiction to make it happen.\n\n00:09:13.238 --> 00:09:15.405\nThank you.\n\n00:09:15.405 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_doolittle_how_your_working_memory_makes_sense_of_the_world", "transcript": "So yesterday, I was out in the street in front of this building, and I was walking down the sidewalk, and I had company, several of us, and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks. We're not talking each other. We're facing forward. We're moving. When the person in front of me slows down. And so I'm watching him, and he slows down, and finally he stops. Well, that wasn't fast enough for me, so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him, and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing, and he was doing this. He was texting, and he couldn't text and walk at the same time. Now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective. We're going to do working memory today.Now, working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. You're going it right now. It's not something we can turn off. If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay? So right now, you're doing just fine.Now working memory has four basic components. It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it, mixes it, processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. Now the current goal isn't something like, I want to be president or the best surfer in the world. It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie, or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room. Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that, our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal.Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history, and it's associated with a lot of positive effects. People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests, however important that is. They're able to have high levels of writing ability. They're also able to reason at high levels.So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks, and we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride. You up for that? Okay.I'm going to give you five words, and I just want you to hang on to them. Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. Five words. While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. I want to see what happens with those words. So here's the words: tree, highway, mirror, Saturn and electrode. So far so good? Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight. Just shout it out. (Mumbling) (Laughter) In fact it's \u2014 (Mumbling) \u2014 exactly. (Laughter) All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go, \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.\" It's a neurological test, just in case you were wondering. All right, now what I want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the English alphabet backwards. You should have started with Z. (Laughter)All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words? Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half, right, which is normal. There will be a range. Some people can hang on to five. Some people can hang on to 10. Some will be down to two or three.What we know is this is really important to the way we function, right? And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us, and it comes at us very quickly, and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea. Now don't get me wrong, working memory is awesome. Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward. It allows us to make sense of the world around us. But it does have certain limits.Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. We can have a conversation, and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation. It allows us to problem-solve, critical think. We can be in the middle of a meeting, listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it, decide whether or not we like it, ask follow-up questions. All of that occurs within working memory. It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter) Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for. Now, a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. It's limited in capacity, limited in duration, limited in focus. We tend to remember about four things. Okay? It used to be seven, but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four, and we were overachieving. Now we can remember those four things for about 10 to 20 seconds unless we do something with it, unless we process it, unless we apply it to something, unless we talk to somebody about it.When we think about working memory, we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there? You do know the solution to that, right? You go back to that original room. (Laughter) Have you ever forgotten your keys? You ever forgotten your car? You ever forgotten your kids? Have you ever been involved in a conversation, and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting? (Laughter) So you're nodding and you're smiling, but you're really paying attention to this one over here, until you hear that last word go up, and you realize, you've been asked a question. (Laughter) And you're really hoping the answer is no, because that's what you're about to say. All of that talks about working memory, what we can do and what we can't do. We need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity, and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that. We negotiate that through strategies.So what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here, and these will be really important because you are now in an information target-rich environment for the next several days. Now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence, our life, immediately and repeatedly. We need to process what's going on the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later, not a week later, at the moment. So we need to think about, well, do I agree with him? What's missing? What would I like to know? Do I agree with the assumptions? How can I apply this in my life? It's a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice. So we need to think about it here. In between, we want to talk to people about it. We're going to write it down, and when you get home, pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time. Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. It's very positive.The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively. Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge. What we want to do is spin that around. We want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful. We also want to use imagery. We are built for images. We need to take advantage of that. Think about things in images, write things down that way. If you read a book, pull things up. I just got through reading \"The Great Gatsby,\" and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head, so my own version.The last one is organization and support. We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do. We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us. Organization helps, so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. If we are providing knowledge and experience, we need to structure that.And the last one is support. We all started as novices. Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication. We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that. The support may come in asking people questions, giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images, but we need to support it.Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn. If we're not processing life, we're not living it. Live life.

Typically we end up with about less than half,\n\n00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:53.582\nright, which is normal. There will be a range.\n\n00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:55.138\nSome people can hang on to five.\n\n00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:56.422\nSome people can hang on to 10.\n\n00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:58.727\nSome will be down to two or three.\n\n00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:02.131\nWhat we know is this is really important\nto the way we function, right?\n\n00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:04.079\nAnd it's going to be really important here at TED\n\n00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.115\nbecause you're going to be exposed\nto so many different ideas.\n\n00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.322\nNow the problem that we have\n\n00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:11.034\nis that life comes at us,\n\n00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.151\nand it comes at us very quickly,\n\n00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:17.064\nand what we need to do is to take that amorphous\n\n00:04:17.064 --> 00:04:18.842\nflow of experience and somehow\n\n00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.349\nextract meaning from it\n\n00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:21.648\nwith a working memory\n\n00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:23.917\nthat's about the size of a pea.\n\n00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:26.464\nNow don't get me wrong,\nworking memory is awesome.\n\n00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:28.579\nWorking memory allows us\n\n00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:30.951\nto investigate our current experience\n\n00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:32.446\nas we move forward.\n\n00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:35.614\nIt allows us to make sense of the world around us.\n\n00:04:35.614 --> 00:04:37.533\nBut it does have certain limits.\n\n00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:41.376\nNow working memory is great\nfor allowing us to communicate.\n\n00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.848\nWe can have a conversation,\n\n00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:45.535\nand I can build a narrative around that\n\n00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.265\nso I know where we've been and where we're going\n\n00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:49.353\nand how to contribute to this conversation.\n\n00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:51.590\nIt allows us to problem-solve, critical think.\n\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.394\nWe can be in the middle of a meeting,\n\n00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.897\nlisten to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,\n\n00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:57.539\ndecide whether or not we like it,\n\n00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.797\nask follow-up questions.\n\n00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:02.167\nAll of that occurs within working memory.\n\n00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.014\nIt also allows us to go to the store\n\n00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:07.668\nand allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese\n\n00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:09.439\nwhen what we're really looking for\n\n00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.276\nis Red Bull and bacon.

We need to practice.\n\n00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.051\nSo we need to think about it here.\n\n00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:36.846\nIn between, we want to talk to people about it.\n\n00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:39.069\nWe're going to write it down,\nand when you get home,\n\n00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:41.029\npull out those notes and think about them\n\n00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.418\nand end up practicing over time.\n\n00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:45.969\nPractice for some reason\nbecame a very negative thing.\n\n00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:47.421\nIt's very positive.\n\n00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:50.471\nThe next thing is, we need to think elaboratively\n\n00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.811\nand we need to think illustratively.\n\n00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:56.265\nOftentimes, we think that we have to relate\nnew knowledge to prior knowledge.\n\n00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:58.195\nWhat we want to do is spin that around.\n\n00:07:58.195 --> 00:07:59.952\nWe want to take all of our existence\n\n00:07:59.952 --> 00:08:01.705\nand wrap it around that new knowledge\n\n00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:05.153\nand make all of these connections\nand it becomes more meaningful.\n\n00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:08.947\nWe also want to use imagery.\nWe are built for images.\n\n00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.805\nWe need to take advantage of that.\n\n00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:12.315\nThink about things in images,\n\n00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:14.664\nwrite things down that way.\n\n00:08:14.664 --> 00:08:16.226\nIf you read a book, pull things up.\n\n00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:18.279\nI just got through reading \"The Great Gatsby,\"\n\n00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:21.378\nand I have a perfect idea of what he looks like\n\n00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:24.376\nin my head, so my own version.\n\n00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:26.379\nThe last one is organization and support.\n\n00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.948\nWe are meaning-making machines.

(Laughter)Okay. You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value. (Laughter) The rest of you won't find my talk personally relevant, but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating.I'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book, which compares traditional, small, tribal societies with our large, modern societies, with respect to many topics such as bringing up children, growing older, health, dealing with danger, settling disputes, religion and speaking more than one language.Those tribal societies, which constituted all human societies for most of human history, are far more diverse than are our modern, recent, big societies. All big societies that have governments, and where most people are strangers to each other, are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies. Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society. They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn. Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned as primitive and miserable, but also they shouldn't be romanticized as happy and peaceful. When we learn of tribal practices, some of them will horrify us, but there are other tribal practices which, when we hear about them, we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves.Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years, and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly, whereas in traditional societies, older people instead live out their lives among their children, their other relatives, and their lifelong friends. Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies, from much worse to much better than in our modern societies.At the worst extreme, many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways: by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die, or by abandoning them when the group moves, or by encouraging older people to commit suicide, or by killing older people. In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents? It happens mainly under two conditions. One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can't walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions. The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments, such as the Arctic or deserts, where there are periodic food shortages, and occasionally there just isn't enough food to keep everyone alive. Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able-bodied adults and for children. To us Americans, it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father, but what could those traditional societies do differently? They face a cruel situation of no choice. Their old people had to do it to their own parents, and the old people know what now is going to happen to them.At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme, are the New Guinea farming societies where I've been doing my fieldwork  for the past 50 years, and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world. In those societies, older people are cared for. They are fed. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children, relatives and lifelong friends.There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people. The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society's values.First, as regards usefulness, older people continue to perform useful services. One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food. Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren, thereby freeing up their own adult children, the parents of those grandchildren, to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren. Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools, weapons, baskets, pots and textiles. In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies, and the people most knowledgeable about politics, medicine, religion, songs and dances.Finally, older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern, literate societies, where our sources of information are books and the Internet. In contrast, in traditional societies without writing, older people are the repositories of information. It's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. Those, then, are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society's treatment of the elderly.The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society's cultural values. For example, there's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia, associated with Confucius' doctrine of filial piety, which means obedience, respect and support for elderly parents. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals. Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources. That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited, for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant, or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients, American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them, even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them. There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S. One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work, so older people who are no longer working aren't respected. Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence, so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent. Still a third reason is our American cult of youth, which shows up even in our advertisements. Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people, even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer. Just think, what's the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old? Never. Instead, the only American ads featuring white-haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.Well, what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies? There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives, much better health in our old age, and much better recreational opportunities. Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people, and that each old person has less individual value. Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age, because older people, their children, and their friends, all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. We Americans move on the average every five years. Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce, carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work. Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies. Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge. When we want some information, we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old, but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later. And conversely, we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society. For example, as a 15-year-old, I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule. Today, though, those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. Conversely, I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life. My family's first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered: an on-off switch, a volume knob, and a channel selector knob. Today, just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house, I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me. I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S., and to make better use of their value? That's a huge problem. In my remaining four minutes today, I can offer just a few suggestions. One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it, as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children. Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers, grandparents offer superior, motivated, experienced child care. They've already gained experience from raising their own children. They usually love their grandchildren, and are eager to spend time with them. Unlike other caregivers, grandparents don't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby. A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. At the same time, older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change, but that could come back. For example, only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression, the experience of living through a world war, and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs. Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things, but millions of older Americans do. Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations could come back. Even if they don't come back, we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like. Older people have that experience. Younger people don't.The remaining value of older people that I'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do, there are other things that they can do better than younger people. A challenge for society is  to make use of those things that older people are better at doing. Some abilities, of course, decrease with age. Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina, ambition, and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation, such as figuring out the structure of DNA, best left to scientists under the age of 30. Conversely, valuable attributes that increase with age include experience, understanding of people and human relationships, ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way, and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases, such as economics and comparative history, best left to scholars over the age of 60. Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising, administering, advising, strategizing, teaching, synthesizing, and devising long-term plans. I've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, who are still active as investment managers, farmers, lawyers and doctors. In short, many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern, big societies.Paradoxically nowadays, when we have more elderly people than ever before, living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before, old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies. But what's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small, traditional societies. To mention just a few examples, our lives are longer, materially much richer, and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies, and perhaps to be learned from them. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer. Their children are more self-confident, more independent, and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do. They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases, and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them.Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1877, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.703 --> 00:00:14.932\nTo give me an idea of how many of you here\n\n00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:17.054\nmay find what I'm about to tell you\n\n00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:18.679\nof practical value,\n\n00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.368\nlet me ask you please to raise your hands:\n\n00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:24.935\nWho here is either over 65 years old\n\n00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.704\nor hopes to live past age 65\n\n00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:31.649\nor has parents or grandparents who did live\n\n00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.616\nor have lived past 65,\n\n00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:36.201\nraise your hands please.

00:01:00.400\ntraditional, small, tribal societies\n\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.950\nwith our large, modern societies,\n\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.575\nwith respect to many topics\n\n00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.434\nsuch as bringing up children,\n\n00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:10.355\ngrowing older, health, dealing with danger,\n\n00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.700\nsettling disputes, religion\n\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.491\nand speaking more than one language.\n\n00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:18.048\nThose tribal societies, which constituted\n\n00:01:18.048 --> 00:01:21.033\nall human societies for most of human history,\n\n00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:24.327\nare far more diverse than are our modern,\n\n00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:26.494\nrecent, big societies.\n\n00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:28.857\nAll big societies that have governments,\n\n00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:31.123\nand where most people are strangers to each other,\n\n00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.471\nare inevitably similar to each other\n\n00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:36.319\nand different from tribal societies.\n\n00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.630\nTribes constitute thousands of natural experiments\n\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.179\nin how to run a human society.\n\n00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.986\nThey constitute experiments from which we ourselves\n\n00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.388\nmay be able to learn.\n\n00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:49.408\nTribal societies shouldn't be scorned\n\n00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.144\nas primitive and miserable,\n\n00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.515\nbut also they shouldn't be romanticized\n\n00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:55.732\nas happy and peaceful.\n\n00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:57.991\nWhen we learn of tribal practices,\n\n00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:59.765\nsome of them will horrify us,\n\n00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.315\nbut there are other tribal practices which,\n\n00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:03.664\nwhen we hear about them,\n\n00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:05.611\nwe may admire and envy\n\n00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.835\nand wonder whether we could adopt those practices\n\n00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:10.532\nourselves.\n\n00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:13.619\nMost old people in the U.S. end up living\n\n00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.606\nseparately from their children\n\n00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:17.112\nand from most of their friends\n\n00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:18.804\nof their earlier years,\n\n00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:22.658\nand often they live in separate\nretirements homes for the elderly,\n\n00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:24.866\nwhereas in traditional societies,\n\n00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:27.700\nolder people instead live out their lives\n\n00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.866\namong their children, their other relatives,\n\n00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.263\nand their lifelong friends.\n\n00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:34.432\nNevertheless, the treatment of the elderly\n\n00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:37.597\nvaries enormously among traditional societies,\n\n00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:39.778\nfrom much worse to much better\n\n00:02:39.778 --> 00:02:42.736\nthan in our modern societies.\n\n00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:45.533\nAt the worst extreme, many traditional societies\n\n00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.346\nget rid of their elderly\n\n00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:50.877\nin one of four increasingly direct ways:\n\n00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:52.540\nby neglecting their elderly\n\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.969\nand not feeding or cleaning them until they die,\n\n00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.023\nor by abandoning them when the group moves,\n\n00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:02.162\nor by encouraging older people to commit suicide,\n\n00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:05.207\nor by killing older people.\n\n00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:07.956\nIn which tribal societies do children\n\n00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:10.342\nabandon or kill their parents?\n\n00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:13.366\nIt happens mainly under two conditions.\n\n00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:16.346\nOne is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies\n\n00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.069\nthat often shift camp\n\n00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.248\nand that are physically incapable\n\n00:03:20.248 --> 00:03:23.371\nof transporting old people who can't walk\n\n00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:25.931\nwhen the able-bodied younger people already\n\n00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:27.866\nhave to carry their young children\n\n00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:30.684\nand all their physical possessions.\n\n00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:32.848\nThe other condition is in societies\n\n00:03:32.848 --> 00:03:36.158\nliving in marginal or fluctuating environments,\n\n00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:38.491\nsuch as the Arctic or deserts,\n\n00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:41.075\nwhere there are periodic food shortages,\n\n00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:43.004\nand occasionally there just isn't enough food\n\n00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:45.484\nto keep everyone alive.\n\n00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:47.908\nWhatever food is available has to be reserved\n\n00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:52.233\nfor able-bodied adults and for children.\n\n00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:55.133\nTo us Americans, it sounds horrible\n\n00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.366\nto think of abandoning or killing\n\n00:03:57.366 --> 00:03:59.547\nyour own sick wife or husband\n\n00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.846\nor elderly mother or father,\n\n00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:05.605\nbut what could those traditional societies\n\n00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:07.088\ndo differently?\n\n00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:10.908\nThey face a cruel situation of no choice.\n\n00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:13.903\nTheir old people had to do it to their own parents,\n\n00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:15.191\nand the old people know\n\n00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:18.342\nwhat now is going to happen to them.\n\n00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:20.156\nAt the opposite extreme\n\n00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:22.835\nin treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,\n\n00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:24.822\nare the New Guinea farming societies\n\n00:04:24.822 --> 00:04:27.819\nwhere I've been doing my fieldwork \nfor the past 50 years,\n\n00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.066\nand most other sedentary traditional societies\n\n00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:33.152\naround the world.\n\n00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:36.100\nIn those societies, older people are cared for.\n\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.450\nThey are fed. They remain valuable.\n\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.638\nAnd they continue to live in the same hut\n\n00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:43.325\nor else in a nearby hut near their children,\n\n00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:47.224\nrelatives and lifelong friends.\n\n00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:49.656\nThere are two main sets of reasons for this variation\n\n00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:52.011\namong societies in their treatment\n\n00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:53.408\nof old people.\n\n00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:55.045\nThe variation depends especially\n\n00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.315\non the usefulness of old people\n\n00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:00.028\nand on the society's values.\n\n00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:02.351\nFirst, as regards usefulness,\n\n00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:05.806\nolder people continue to perform useful services.\n\n00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.491\nOne use of older people in traditional societies\n\n00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.491\nis that they often are still effective\n\n00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:12.904\nat producing food.\n\n00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:15.317\nAnother traditional usefulness of older people\n\n00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:18.596\nis that they are capable of babysitting\n\n00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:20.290\ntheir grandchildren,\n\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.960\nthereby freeing up their own adult children,\n\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.831\nthe parents of those grandchildren,\n\n00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:28.304\nto go hunting and gathering\nfood for the grandchildren.\n\n00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:30.509\nStill another traditional value of older people\n\n00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.429\nis in making tools, weapons, baskets,\n\n00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:35.386\npots and textiles.\n\n00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:38.635\nIn fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.\n\n00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:41.403\nOlder people usually are the leaders\n\n00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:43.252\nof traditional societies,\n\n00:05:43.252 --> 00:05:46.511\nand the people most knowledgeable about politics,\n\n00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.510\nmedicine, religion, songs and dances.\n\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.962\nFinally, older people in traditional societies\n\n00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:56.889\nhave a huge significance that would never occur\n\n00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.565\nto us in our modern, literate societies,\n\n00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:02.980\nwhere our sources of information are books\n\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.664\nand the Internet.\n\n00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:08.087\nIn contrast, in traditional societies without writing,\n\n00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:11.773\nolder people are the repositories of information.\n\n00:06:11.773 --> 00:06:14.338\nIt's their knowledge that spells the difference\n\n00:06:14.338 --> 00:06:18.088\nbetween survival and death for their whole society\n\n00:06:18.088 --> 00:06:21.346\nin a time of crisis caused by rare events\n\n00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:23.941\nfor which only the oldest people alive\n\n00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:26.230\nhave had experience.\n\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.700\nThose, then, are the ways in which older people\n\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.603\nare useful in traditional societies.\n\n00:06:31.603 --> 00:06:34.165\nTheir usefulness varies and contributes\n\n00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:36.783\nto variation in the society's treatment\n\n00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:38.783\nof the elderly.\n\n00:06:38.783 --> 00:06:40.602\nThe other set of reasons for variation\n\n00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:42.477\nin the treatment of the elderly is\n\n00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:45.712\nthe society's cultural values.\n\n00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:47.738\nFor example, there's particular emphasis\n\n00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:50.947\non respect for the elderly in East Asia,\n\n00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:53.858\nassociated with Confucius' doctrine\n\n00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:57.408\nof filial piety, which means obedience,\n\n00:06:57.408 --> 00:07:01.502\nrespect and support for elderly parents.\n\n00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:05.215\nCultural values that emphasize\nrespect for older people\n\n00:07:05.215 --> 00:07:08.032\ncontrast with the low status of the elderly\n\n00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:10.194\nin the U.S.\n\n00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:12.752\nOlder Americans are at a big disadvantage\n\n00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:14.865\nin job applications.\n\n00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:17.400\nThey're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.\n\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.023\nOur hospitals have an explicit policy\n\n00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:24.990\ncalled age-based allocation of healthcare resources.\n\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.763\nThat sinister expression means that\n\n00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:29.969\nif hospital resources are limited,\n\n00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:32.019\nfor example if only one donor heart\n\n00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.317\nbecomes available for transplant,\n\n00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:36.419\nor if a surgeon has time to operate\n\n00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:38.930\non only a certain number of patients,\n\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.880\nAmerican hospitals have an explicit policy\n\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.200\nof giving preference to younger patients\n\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.680\nover older patients\n\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.924\non the grounds that younger patients are considered\n\n00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:50.741\nmore valuable to society\n\n00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:53.386\nbecause they have more years of life ahead of them,\n\n00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:56.046\neven though the younger patients have fewer years\n\n00:07:56.046 --> 00:08:00.028\nof valuable life experience behind them.\n\n00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:02.256\nThere are several reasons for this low status\n\n00:08:02.256 --> 00:08:04.598\nof the elderly in the U.S.\n\n00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:07.783\nOne is our Protestant work ethic\n\n00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:10.096\nwhich places high value on work,\n\n00:08:10.096 --> 00:08:12.319\nso older people who are no longer working\n\n00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:14.302\naren't respected.\n\n00:08:14.302 --> 00:08:17.159\nAnother reason is our American emphasis\n\n00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:20.542\non the virtues of self-reliance and independence,\n\n00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.611\nso we instinctively look down on older people\n\n00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:27.208\nwho are no longer self-reliant and independent.\n\n00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:31.309\nStill a third reason is our American cult of youth,\n\n00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:34.117\nwhich shows up even in our advertisements.\n\n00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:37.381\nAds for Coca-Cola and beer always depict\n\n00:08:37.381 --> 00:08:38.936\nsmiling young people,\n\n00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:40.906\neven though old as well as young people\n\n00:08:40.906 --> 00:08:43.228\nbuy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.\n\n00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:45.231\nJust think, what's the last time you saw\n\n00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:47.908\na Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people\n\n00:08:47.908 --> 00:08:50.857\n85 years old? Never.\n\n00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:52.663\nInstead, the only American ads\n\n00:08:52.663 --> 00:08:54.669\nfeaturing white-haired old people\n\n00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:58.534\nare ads for retirement homes and pension planning.\n\n00:08:58.534 --> 00:09:00.584\nWell, what has changed in the status\n\n00:09:00.584 --> 00:09:02.567\nof the elderly today\n\n00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:05.956\ncompared to their status in traditional societies?\n\n00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:07.826\nThere have been a few changes for the better\n\n00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.031\nand more changes for the worse.\n\n00:09:10.031 --> 00:09:11.632\nBig changes for the better\n\n00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:13.783\ninclude the fact that today we enjoy\n\n00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.767\nmuch longer lives,\n\n00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:18.061\nmuch better health in our old age,\n\n00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:21.699\nand much better recreational opportunities.\n\n00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:23.969\nAnother change for the better is that we now have\n\n00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:26.809\nspecialized retirement facilities\n\n00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:30.160\nand programs to take care of old people.\n\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.028\nChanges for the worse begin with the cruel reality\n\n00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:34.717\nthat we now have\n\n00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:37.291\nmore old people and fewer young people\n\n00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:39.975\nthan at any time in the past.\n\n00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:41.726\nThat means that all those old people\n\n00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:44.151\nare more of a burden on the few young people,\n\n00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:48.637\nand that each old person has less individual value.\n\n00:09:48.637 --> 00:09:51.821\nAnother big change for the worse\nin the status of the elderly\n\n00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:54.498\nis the breaking of social ties with age,\n\n00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:56.342\nbecause older people, their children,\n\n00:09:56.342 --> 00:09:57.658\nand their friends,\n\n00:09:57.658 --> 00:10:00.508\nall move and scatter independently of each other\n\n00:10:00.508 --> 00:10:02.762\nmany times during their lives.\n\n00:10:02.762 --> 00:10:04.575\nWe Americans move on the average\n\n00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:06.528\nevery five years.\n\n00:10:06.528 --> 00:10:08.559\nHence our older people are likely\n\n00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.866\nto end up living distant from their children\n\n00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:13.669\nand the friends of their youth.\n\n00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:16.831\nYet another change for the worse\nin the status of the elderly\n\n00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:20.561\nis formal retirement from the workforce,\n\n00:10:20.561 --> 00:10:23.311\ncarrying with it a loss of work friendships\n\n00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:27.451\nand a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.\n\n00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:29.936\nPerhaps the biggest change for the worse\n\n00:10:29.936 --> 00:10:32.809\nis that our elderly are objectively\n\n00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:35.971\nless useful than in traditional societies.\n\n00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.934\nWidespread literacy means that they are no longer\n\n00:10:38.934 --> 00:10:41.565\nuseful as repositories of knowledge.\n\n00:10:41.565 --> 00:10:43.508\nWhen we want some information,\n\n00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:45.769\nwe look it up in a book or we Google it\n\n00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:49.239\ninstead of finding some old person to ask.\n\n00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:51.326\nThe slow pace of technological change\n\n00:10:51.326 --> 00:10:53.148\nin traditional societies\n\n00:10:53.148 --> 00:10:55.998\nmeans that what someone learns there as a child\n\n00:10:55.998 --> 00:10:58.657\nis still useful when that person is old,\n\n00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:02.260\nbut the rapid pace of technological change today\n\n00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.327\nmeans that what we learn as children\n\n00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:07.217\nis no longer useful 60 years later.\n\n00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:09.596\nAnd conversely, we older people are not fluent\n\n00:11:09.596 --> 00:11:12.630\nin the technologies essential for surviving\n\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.601\nin modern society.\n\n00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:16.774\nFor example, as a 15-year-old,\n\n00:11:16.774 --> 00:11:20.364\nI was considered outstandingly\ngood at multiplying numbers\n\n00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:23.559\nbecause I had memorized the multiplication tables\n\n00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:25.704\nand I know how to use logarithms\n\n00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:28.567\nand I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.\n\n00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:31.653\nToday, though, those skills are utterly useless\n\n00:11:31.653 --> 00:11:34.024\nbecause any idiot\n\n00:11:34.024 --> 00:11:36.382\ncan now multiply eight-digit numbers\n\n00:11:36.382 --> 00:11:39.569\naccurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.\n\n00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:41.739\nConversely, I at age 75\n\n00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:44.403\nam incompetent at skills\n\n00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:46.857\nessential for everyday life.\n\n00:11:46.857 --> 00:11:49.641\nMy family's first TV set in 1948\n\n00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:52.694\nhad only three knobs that I quickly mastered:\n\n00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:55.444\nan on-off switch, a volume knob,\n\n00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:57.665\nand a channel selector knob.\n\n00:11:57.665 --> 00:11:59.753\nToday, just to watch a program\n\n00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:02.209\non the TV set in my own house,\n\n00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.926\nI have to operate a 41-button TV remote\n\n00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:07.908\nthat utterly defeats me.\n\n00:12:07.908 --> 00:12:10.922\nI have to telephone my 25-year-old sons\n\n00:12:10.922 --> 00:12:13.119\nand ask them to talk me through it\n\n00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:18.116\nwhile I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.\n\n00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:20.763\nWhat can we do to improve the lives of the elderly\n\n00:12:20.763 --> 00:12:24.217\nin the U.S., and to make better use of their value?\n\n00:12:24.217 --> 00:12:25.991\nThat's a huge problem.\n\n00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.462\nIn my remaining four minutes today,\n\n00:12:28.462 --> 00:12:31.039\nI can offer just a few suggestions.\n\n00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.961\nOne value of older people is that they are\n\n00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:36.405\nincreasingly useful as grandparents\n\n00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:38.912\nfor offering high-quality childcare\n\n00:12:38.912 --> 00:12:41.565\nto their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,\n\n00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:44.414\nas more young women enter the workforce\n\n00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:46.748\nand as fewer young parents of either gender\n\n00:12:46.748 --> 00:12:50.408\nstay home as full-time caretakers of their children.\n\n00:12:50.408 --> 00:12:52.444\nCompared to the usual alternatives\n\n00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:56.042\nof paid babysitters and day care centers,\n\n00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:59.169\ngrandparents offer superior, motivated,\n\n00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:01.857\nexperienced child care.\n\n00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:05.123\nThey've already gained experience\nfrom raising their own children.\n\n00:13:05.123 --> 00:13:07.467\nThey usually love their grandchildren,\n\n00:13:07.467 --> 00:13:10.132\nand are eager to spend time with them.\n\n00:13:10.132 --> 00:13:12.033\nUnlike other caregivers,\n\n00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:14.930\ngrandparents don't quit their job\n\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.366\nbecause they found another job with higher pay\n\n00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:20.879\nlooking after another baby.\n\n00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:23.283\nA second value of older people is paradoxically\n\n00:13:23.283 --> 00:13:25.944\nrelated to their loss of value\n\n00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:30.017\nas a result of changing world\nconditions and technology.\n\n00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:32.053\nAt the same time, older people have gained\n\n00:13:32.053 --> 00:13:34.364\nin value today precisely because\n\n00:13:34.364 --> 00:13:37.473\nof their unique experience of living conditions\n\n00:13:37.473 --> 00:13:39.192\nthat have now become rare\n\n00:13:39.192 --> 00:13:42.502\nbecause of rapid change, but that could come back.\n\n00:13:42.502 --> 00:13:45.456\nFor example, only Americans now in their 70s\n\n00:13:45.456 --> 00:13:47.716\nor older today can remember\n\n00:13:47.716 --> 00:13:51.044\nthe experience of living through a great depression,\n\n00:13:51.044 --> 00:13:53.682\nthe experience of living through a world war,\n\n00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:56.228\nand agonizing whether or not\n\n00:13:56.228 --> 00:13:59.265\ndropping atomic bombs would be more horrible\n\n00:13:59.265 --> 00:14:03.378\nthan the likely consequences\nof not dropping atomic bombs.\n\n00:14:03.378 --> 00:14:05.654\nMost of our current voters and politicians\n\n00:14:05.654 --> 00:14:08.386\nhave no personal experience of any of those things,\n\n00:14:08.386 --> 00:14:11.081\nbut millions of older Americans do.\n\n00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:13.732\nUnfortunately, all of those terrible situations\n\n00:14:13.732 --> 00:14:15.119\ncould come back.\n\n00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:16.425\nEven if they don't come back,\n\n00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:18.617\nwe have to be able to plan for them\n\n00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:21.428\non the basis of the experience of what they were like.\n\n00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:23.262\nOlder people have that experience.\n\n00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.315\nYounger people don't.\n\n00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:26.835\nThe remaining value of older people\n\n00:14:26.835 --> 00:14:29.278\nthat I'll mention involves recognizing that\n\n00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:31.858\nwhile there are many things that older people\n\n00:14:31.858 --> 00:14:33.464\ncan no longer do,\n\n00:14:33.464 --> 00:14:34.953\nthere are other things that they can do\n\n00:14:34.953 --> 00:14:37.048\nbetter than younger people.\n\n00:14:37.048 --> 00:14:39.944\nA challenge for society is \nto make use of those things\n\n00:14:39.944 --> 00:14:42.416\nthat older people are better at doing.\n\n00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:45.665\nSome abilities, of course, decrease with age.\n\n00:14:45.665 --> 00:14:48.303\nThose include abilities at tasks\n\n00:14:48.303 --> 00:14:51.874\nrequiring physical strength and stamina,\n\n00:14:51.874 --> 00:14:54.998\nambition, and the power of novel reasoning\n\n00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:57.423\nin a circumscribed situation,\n\n00:14:57.423 --> 00:15:00.011\nsuch as figuring out the structure of DNA,\n\n00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:03.912\nbest left to scientists under the age of 30.\n\n00:15:03.912 --> 00:15:05.561\nConversely, valuable attributes\n\n00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:09.107\nthat increase with age include experience,\n\n00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:12.120\nunderstanding of people and human relationships,\n\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.411\nability to help other people\n\n00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:16.839\nwithout your own ego getting in the way,\n\n00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:20.364\nand interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,\n\n00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:23.189\nsuch as economics and comparative history,\n\n00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.403\nbest left to scholars over the age of 60.\n\n00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:28.875\nHence older people are\nmuch better than younger people\n\n00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:32.846\nat supervising, administering, advising,\n\n00:15:32.846 --> 00:15:36.328\nstrategizing, teaching, synthesizing,\n\n00:15:36.328 --> 00:15:39.034\nand devising long-term plans.\n\n00:15:39.034 --> 00:15:41.054\nI've seen this value of older people\n\n00:15:41.054 --> 00:15:43.626\nwith so many of my friends in their 60s,\n\n00:15:43.626 --> 00:15:45.616\n70s, 80s and 90s,\n\n00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:48.901\nwho are still active as investment managers,\n\n00:15:48.901 --> 00:15:51.914\nfarmers, lawyers and doctors.\n\n00:15:51.914 --> 00:15:54.044\nIn short, many traditional societies\n\n00:15:54.044 --> 00:15:56.157\nmake better use of their elderly\n\n00:15:56.157 --> 00:15:59.267\nand give their elderly more satisfying lives\n\n00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:02.117\nthan we do in modern, big societies.\n\n00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:03.982\nParadoxically nowadays,\n\n00:16:03.982 --> 00:16:06.908\nwhen we have more elderly people than ever before,\n\n00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:09.629\nliving healthier lives and with better medical care\n\n00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:11.115\nthan ever before,\n\n00:16:11.115 --> 00:16:13.822\nold age is in some respects more miserable\n\n00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:15.589\nthan ever before.\n\n00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:18.011\nThe lives of the elderly are widely recognized\n\n00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:20.778\nas constituting a disaster area\n\n00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:23.311\nof modern

"https://www.ted.com/talks/suzana_herculano_houzel_what_is_so_special_about_the_human_brain", "transcript": "What is so special about the human brain? Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us? What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does? When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago, scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. Though it was based on very little evidence, many scientists thought that all mammalian brains, including the human brain, were made in the same way, with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain. This means that two brains of the same size, like these two, with a respectable 400 grams, should have similar numbers of neurons. Now, if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain, then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities. And yet, one is a chimp, and the other is a cow. Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it, but we eat them. I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex, elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. So this is a first indication that the \"all brains are made the same way\" scenario is not quite right.But let's play along. If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes, larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains, and the larger the brain, the more cognitively able its owner should be. So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. And here comes the bad news: Our brain, not the largest one around. It seems quite vexing. Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos, and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos, which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities. It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule. Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better, and it could be better, for example, in that it seems larger than it should be, with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies. So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body. So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are, so their brains should also be larger than ours, but instead it's the other way around. Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories, just to keep your brain working.So the human brain is larger than it should be, it uses much more energy than it should, so it's special. And this is where the story started to bother me. In biology, we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general, so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us? Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons. Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest-sized brain. Maybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons of any brain, regardless of its size, especially in the cerebral cortex. So this to me became the important question to answer: how many neurons does the human brain have, and how does that compare to other animals?Now, you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons, so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from. But nobody did. I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it. It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain, or in any other brain for that matter.So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain, and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup. It works like this: You take a brain, or parts of that brain, and you dissolve it in detergent, which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact, so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this, like a clear soup. This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain. Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. It's simple, it's straightforward, and it's really fast. So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far, and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way. Take rodents and primates, for instance: In larger rodent brains, the average size of the neuron increases, so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons. But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger, which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain. The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size, and the larger the brain, the larger this difference will be. Well, what about our brain then? We found that we have, on average, 86 billion neurons, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex, and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning, and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has, I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean. Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically, we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain. So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos. That's not possible. A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight, and this impossible brain would go in the body of 89 tons. I don't think it looks like us.So this brings us to a very important conclusion already, which is that we are not rodents. The human brain is not a large rat brain. Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes, but that's not a fair comparison to make, given that we know that we are not rodents. We are primates, so the correct comparison is to other primates. And there, if you do the math, you find that a generic primate with 86 billion neurons would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos, which seems just right, in a body of some 66 kilos, which in my case is exactly right, which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion: I am a primate. And all of you are primates.And so was Darwin. I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. His brain, like ours, was made in the image of other primate brains.So the human brain may be remarkable, yes, but it is not special in its number of neurons. It is just a large primate brain. I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature.Why does it cost so much energy, then? Well, other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs, and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of, we could do the math. And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same, an average of six calories  per billion neurons per day. So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons, and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal, the relative cost of our brain is large, but just because we're primates, not because we're special.Last question, then: how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons, and in particular, if great apes are larger than we are, why don't they have a larger brain  than we do, with more neurons? When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured, maybe there's a simple reason. They just can't afford the energy for both a large body  and a large number of neurons. So we did the math. We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods, and on the other hand, how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs, and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day.And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive, there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons. So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons, but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos. To weigh any more than that, it has to give up neurons. So it's either a large body or a large number of neurons. When you eat like a primate, you can't afford both.One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating, but that gets dangerous, and past a certain point, it's just not possible. Gorillas and orangutans, for instance, afford about 30 billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating, and that seems to be about as much as they can do. Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate.What about us? With our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass, we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding, which is just not feasible. If we ate like a primate, we should not be here.How did we get here, then? Well, if our brain costs just as much energy as it should, and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding, then the only alternative, really, is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. And remarkably, that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago, when they invented cooking. To cook is to use fire to pre-digest foods outside of your body. Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth, so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut, which makes them yield much more energy in much less time. So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food, looking for food, and gobbling down food all day long.So because of cooking, what once was a major liability, this large, dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons, could now become a major asset, now that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution, all of the while remaining just a primate brain. With this large brain now affordable by cooking, we went rapidly from raw foods to culture, agriculture, civilization, grocery stores, electricity, refrigerators, all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint. So what once was a solution now became the problem, and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.So what is the human advantage? What is it that we have that no other animal has? My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, and I think that's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. And what is it that we do that no other animal does, and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large, largest number of neurons in the cortex? In two words, we cook. No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do. And I think that's how we got to become human.Studying the human brain changed  the way I think about food. I now look at my kitchen, and I bow to it, and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans. Thank you very much.

actually be made of\nvery different numbers of neurons.\n\n00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:36.728\nMaybe a very large brain\n\n00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:38.568\ndoes not necessarily have more neurons\n\n00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.789\nthan a more modest-sized brain.\n\n00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.798\nMaybe the human brain \nactually has the most neurons\n\n00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:46.371\nof any brain, regardless of its size,\n\n00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:48.465\nespecially in the cerebral cortex.\n\n00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:50.017\nSo this to me became\n\n00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:51.746\nthe important question to answer:\n\n00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:54.146\nhow many neurons does the human brain have,\n\n00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.668\nand how does that compare to other animals?\n\n00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:59.091\nNow, you may have heard or read somewhere\n\n00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:01.202\nthat we have 100 billion neurons,\n\n00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.288\nso 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues\n\n00:04:03.288 --> 00:04:05.127\nif they knew where this number came from.\n\n00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:06.585\nBut nobody did.\n\n00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:08.038\nI've been digging through the literature\n\n00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:10.096\nfor the original reference for that number,\n\n00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:11.879\nand I could never find it.\n\n00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.618\nIt seems that nobody had actually ever counted\n\n00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:16.152\nthe number of neurons in the human brain,\n\n00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:18.651\nor in any other brain for that matter.\n\n00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:22.186\nSo I came up with my own way\nto count cells in the brain,\n\n00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:24.294\nand it essentially consists of\n\n00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:27.539\ndissolving that brain into soup.\n\n00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.576\nIt works like this:\n\n00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:32.703\nYou take a brain, or parts of that brain,\n\n00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:34.447\nand you dissolve it in detergent,\n\n00:04:34.447 --> 00:04:35.956\nwhich destroys the cell membranes\n\n00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:38.392\nbut keeps the cell nuclei intact,\n\n00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:41.532\nso you end up with a suspension of free nuclei\n\n00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:43.313\nthat looks like this,\n\n00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:44.586\nlike a clear soup.\n\n00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:46.477\nThis soup contains all the nuclei\n\n00:04:46.477 --> 00:04:48.531\nthat once were a mouse brain.\n\n00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:51.561\nNow, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,\n\n00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:54.459\nyou can agitate it and make those nuclei\n\n00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:56.430\nbe distributed homogeneously in the liquid,\n\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.411\nso that now by looking under the microscope\n\n00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:02.494\nat just four or five samples\nof this homogeneous solution,\n\n00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:05.030\nyou can count nuclei, and therefore tell\n\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.709\nhow many cells that brain had.\n\n00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.334\nIt's simple, it's straightforward,\n\n00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:09.768\nand it's really fast.\n\n00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.765\nSo we've used that method to count neurons\n\n00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:14.076\nin dozens of different species so far,\n\n00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:15.765\nand it turns out that all brains\n\n00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.347\nare not made the same way.\n\n00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:20.534\nTake rodents and primates, for instance:\n\n00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:22.818\nIn larger rodent brains, the average size\n\n00:05:22.818 --> 00:05:24.504\nof the neuron increases,\n\n00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:27.103\nso the brain inflates very rapidly\n\n00:05:27.103 --> 00:05:30.268\nand gains size much faster than it gains neurons.\n\n00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:31.971\nBut primate brains gain neurons\n\n00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:34.430\nwithout the average neuron becoming any larger,\n\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.955\nwhich is a very economical way\n\n00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:37.608\nto add neurons to your brain.\n\n00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:39.372\nThe result is that a primate brain\n\n00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.539\nwill always have more neurons than\na rodent brain of the same size,\n\n00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.022\nand the larger the brain,\n\n00:05:44.022 --> 00:05:46.236\nthe larger this difference will be.\n\n00:05:46.236 --> 00:05:48.339\nWell, what about our brain then?\n\n00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.023\nWe found that we have, on average,\n\n00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:51.808\n86 billion neurons,\n\n00:05:51.808 --> 00:05:54.807\n16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,\n\n00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:56.888\nand if you consider that the cerebral cortex\n\n00:05:56.888 --> 00:05:59.982\nis the seat of functions like\n\n00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:03.119\nawareness and logical and abstract reasoning,\n\n00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.103\nand that 16 billion is the most neurons\n\n00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.724\nthat any cortex has,\n\n00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:10.442\nI think this is the simplest explanation\n\n00:06:10.442 --> 00:06:13.584\nfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.\n\n00:06:13.584 --> 00:06:16.805\nBut just as important is what\nthe 86 billion neurons mean.\n\n00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:18.334\nBecause we found that the relationship\n\n00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:20.686\nbetween the size of the brain\nand its number of neurons\n\n00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:22.313\ncould be described mathematically,\n\n00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:24.531\nwe could calculate what a human brain\n\n00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.205\nwould look like if it was made like a rodent brain.\n\n00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.779\nSo, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons\n\n00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.900\nwould weigh 36 kilos.\n\n00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.533\nThat's not possible.\n\n00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:37.439\nA brain that huge would be crushed\n\n00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.623\nby its own weight,\n\n00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:40.210\nand this impossible brain would go\n\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.981\nin the body of 89 tons.\n\n00:06:43.981 --> 00:06:46.115\nI don't think it looks like us.\n\n00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:48.668\nSo this brings us to a very important\nconclusion already,\n\n00:06:48.668 --> 00:06:51.315\nwhich is that we are not rodents.\n\n00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:54.583\nThe human brain is not a large rat brain.\n\n00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:57.211\nCompared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,\n\n00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:59.431\nbut that's not a fair comparison to make,\n\n00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:01.520\ngiven that we know that we are not rodents.\n\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.910\nWe are primates,\n\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.684\nso the correct comparison is to other primates.\n\n00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:06.911\nAnd there, if you do the math,\n\n00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:09.697\nyou find that a generic primate\n\n00:07:09.697 --> 00:07:11.627\nwith 86 billion neurons\n\n00:07:11.627 --> 00:07:14.630\nwould have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,\n\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.519\nwhich seems just right,\n\n00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.491\nin a body of some 66 kilos,\n\n00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:21.136\nwhich in my case is exactly right,\n\n00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:23.756\nwhich brings us to a very unsurprising\n\n00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:26.725\nbut still incredibly important conclusion:\n\n00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:28.066\nI am a primate.\n\n00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:30.764\nAnd all of you are primates.\n\n00:07:30.764 --> 00:07:32.664\nAnd so was Darwin.\n\n00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:35.604\nI love to think that Darwin\nwould have really appreciated this.\n\n00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:37.571\nHis brain, like ours,\n\n00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:41.082\nwas made in the image of other primate brains.\n\n00:07:41.082 --> 00:07:43.384\nSo the human brain may be remarkable, yes,\n\n00:07:43.384 --> 00:07:46.165\nbut it is not special in its number of neurons.\n\n00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.020\nIt is just a large primate brain.\n\n00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.064\nI think that's a very humbling and sobering thought\n\n00:07:51.064 --> 00:07:54.127\nthat should remind us of our place in nature.\n\n00:07:54.127 --> 00:07:56.771\nWhy does it cost so much energy, then?\n\n00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:58.218\nWell, other people have figured out\n\n00:07:58.218 --> 00:07:59.721\nhow much energy the human brain\n\n00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:01.128\nand that of other species costs,\n\n00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:02.780\nand now that we knew how many neurons\n\n00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.122\neach brain was made of, we could do the math.\n\n00:08:05.122 --> 00:08:06.988\nAnd it turns out that both human\n\n00:08:06.988 --> 00:08:09.811\nand other brains cost about the same,\n\n00:08:09.811 --> 00:08:13.232\nan average of six calories \nper billion neurons per day.\n\n00:08:13.232 --> 00:08:15.371\nSo the total energetic cost of a brain\n\n00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:17.405\nis a simple, linear function\n\n00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:19.114\nof its number of neurons,\n\n00:08:19.114 --> 00:08:21.297\nand it turns out that the human brain\n\n00:08:21.297 --> 00:08:25.138\ncosts just as much energy as you would expect.\n\n00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:27.229\nSo the reason why the human brain\n\n00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:28.901\ncosts so much energy is simply because\n\n00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:30.884\nit has a huge number of neurons,\n\n00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:32.369\nand because we are primates\n\n00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:34.868\nwith many more neurons for a given body size\n\n00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:36.390\nthan any other animal,\n\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.930\nthe relative cost of our brain is large,\n\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.931\nbut just because we're primates,\nnot because we're special.\n\n00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:44.121\nLast question, then:\n\n00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.236\nhow did we come by this\nremarkable number of neurons,\n\n00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:49.136\nand in particular, if great apes\n\n00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:50.691\nare larger than we are,\n\n00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:54.456\nwhy don't they have a larger brain \nthan we do, with more neurons?\n\n00:08:54.456 --> 00:08:56.546\nWhen we realized how much expensive it is\n\n00:08:56.546 --> 00:08:58.879\nto have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,\n\n00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.882\nmaybe there's a simple reason.\n\n00:09:00.882 --> 00:09:02.565\nThey just can't afford the energy\n\n00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:05.515\nfor both a large body \nand a large number of neurons.\n\n00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:06.944\nSo we did the math.\n\n00:09:06.944 --> 00:09:08.544\nWe calculated on the one hand\n\n00:09:08.544 --> 00:09:10.485\nhow much energy a primate gets per day\n\n00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:11.835\nfrom eating raw foods,\n\n00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:13.872\nand on the other hand, how much energy\n\n00:09:13.872 --> 00:09:15.636\na body of a certain size costs\n\n00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:19.023\nand how much energy a brain of a\ncertain number of neurons costs,\n\n00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:20.512\nand we looked for the combinations\n\n00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:22.923\nof body size and number of brain neurons\n\n00:09:22.923 --> 00:09:24.193\nthat a primate could afford\n\n00:09:24.193 --> 00:09:26.741\nif it ate a certain number of hours per day.\n\n00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:28.557\nAnd what we found is that\n\n00:09:28.557 --> 00:09:30.269\nbecause neurons are so expensive,\n\n00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:33.639\nthere is a tradeoff between\nbody size and number of neurons.\n\n00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.590\nSo a primate that eats eight hours per day\n\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.614\ncan afford at most 53 billion neurons,\n\n00:09:39.614 --> 00:09:41.341\nbut then its body cannot be any bigger\n\n00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:43.295\nthan 25 kilos.\n\n00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:44.996\nTo weigh any more than that,\n\n00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:46.765\nit has to give up neurons.\n\n00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:49.418\nSo it's either a large body\n\n00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:50.913\nor a large number of neurons.\n\n00:09:50.913 --> 00:09:52.278\nWhen you eat like a primate,\n\n00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:54.514\nyou can't afford both.\n\n00:09:54.514 --> 00:09:56.478\nOne way out of this metabolic limitation\n\n00:09:56.478 --> 00:09:59.879\nwould be to spend even more hours per day eating,\n\n00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.242\nbut that gets dangerous,\n\n00:10:01.242 --> 00:10:03.961\nand past a certain point, it's just not possible.\n\n00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:05.498\nGorillas and orangutans, for instance,\n\n00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:07.421\nafford about 30 billion neurons\n\n00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:10.387\nby spending eight and a half hours per day eating,\n\n00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:13.503\nand that seems to be about as much as they can do.\n\n00:10:13.503 --> 00:10:15.294\nNine hours of feeding per day\n\n00:10:15.294 --> 00:10:18.565\nseems to be the practical limit for a primate.\n\n00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:20.356\nWhat about us?\n\n00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:21.956\nWith our 86 billion neurons\n\n00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:24.991\nand 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,\n\n00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.552\nwe should have to spend over nine hours\n\n00:10:28.552 --> 00:10:32.127\nper day every single day feeding,\n\n00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:34.166\nwhich is just not feasible.\n\n00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.000\nIf we ate like a primate,\n\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.253\nwe should not be here.\n\n00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:40.380\nHow did we get here, then?\n\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.115\nWell, if our brain costs just as much energy\n\n00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:44.838\nas it should, and if we can't spend\n\n00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:48.512\nevery waking hour of the day feeding,\n\n00:10:48.512 --> 00:10:50.423\nthen the only alternative, really,\n\n00:10:50.423 --> 00:10:52.381\nis to somehow get more energy\n\n00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.334\nout of the same foods.\n\n00:10:54.334 --> 00:10:58.134\nAnd remarkably, that matches exactly\n\n00:10:58.134 --> 00:11:01.171\nwhat our ancestors are believed to have invented\n\n00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:03.010\none and a half million years ago,\n\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.792\nwhen they invented cooking.\n\n00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:07.762\nTo cook is to use fire\n\n00:11:07.762 --> 00:11:11.562\nto pre-digest foods outside of your body.\n\n00:11:11.562 --> 00:11:14.168\nCooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew\n\n00:11:14.168 --> 00:11:16.731\nand to turn completely into mush in your mouth,\n\n00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:18.883\nso that allows them to be completely digested\n\n00:11:18.883 --> 00:11:20.319\nand absorbed in your gut,\n\n00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:23.974\nwhich makes them yield much more\nenergy in much less time.\n\n00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:26.463\nSo cooking frees time for us to do\n\n00:11:26.463 --> 00:11:28.525\nmuch more interesting things with our day\n\n00:11:28.525 --> 00:11:30.005\nand with our neurons\n\n00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:31.910\nthan just thinking about food,\n\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.614\nlooking for food, and gobbling down food\n\n00:11:33.614 --> 00:11:34.839\nall day long.\n\n00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:37.338\nSo because of cooking, what once was\n\n00:11:37.338 --> 00:11:39.691\na major liability, this large,\n\n00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:42.724\ndangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,\n\n00:11:42.724 --> 00:11:44.760\ncould now become a major asset,\n\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.011\nnow that we could both afford \nthe energy for a lot of neurons\n\n00:11:48.014 --> 00:11:50.517\nand the time to do interesting things with them.\n\n00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:52.491\nSo I think this explains why the human brain\n\n00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:55.731\ngrew to become so large so fast in evolution,\n\n00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:59.628\nall of the while remaining just a primate brain.\n\n00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:02.402\nWith this large brain now affordable by cooking,\n\n00:12:02.402 --> 00:12:05.315\nwe went rapidly from raw foods to culture,\n\n00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:07.921\nagriculture, civilization, grocery stores,\n\n00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:09.546\nelectricity, refrigerators,\n\n00:12:09.546 --> 00:12:11.153\nall of those things that nowadays\n\n00:12:11.153 --> 00:12:13.195\nallow us to get all the energy we need\n\n00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:15.977\nfor the whole day in a single sitting\n\n00:12:15.977 --> 00:12:18.931\nat your favorite fast food joint.\n\n00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:21.368\nSo what once was a solution\n\n00:12:21.368 --> 00:12:23.067\nnow became the problem,\n\n00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:28.584\nand ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.\n\n00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:31.140\nSo what is the human advantage?\n\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.643\nWhat is it that we have\n\n00:12:32.643 --> 00:12:35.178\nthat no other animal has?\n\n00:12:35.178 --> 00:12:37.526\nMy answer is that we have the largest number\n\n00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:38.998\nof neurons in the cerebral cortex,\n\n00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:40.842\nand I think that's the simplest explanation\n\n00:12:40.842 --> 00:12:42.855\nfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.\n\n00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:46.082\nAnd what is it that we do that no other animal does,\n\n00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:48.051\nand which I believe was fundamental\n\n00:12:48.051 --> 00:12:51.134\nto allow us to reach that large,\n\n00:12:51.134 --> 00:12:53.356\nlargest number of neurons in the cortex?\n\n00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.571\nIn two words, we cook.\n\n00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:59.137\nNo other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.\n\n00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:02.007\nAnd I think that's how we got to become human.\n\n00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:04.467\nStudying the human brain changed \nthe way I think about food.\n\n00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:06.112\nI now look at my kitchen,\n\n00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:07.582\nand I bow to it,\n\n00:13:07.582 --> 00:13:09.287\nand I thank my ancestors for coming up\n\n00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:11.187\nwith the invention that probably made us humans.\n\n00:13:11.187 --> 00:13:13.319\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:19.672\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Want to be happy? Be grateful", "duration": "870", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_steindl_rast_want_to_be_happy_be_grateful", "transcript": "There is something you know about me, something very personal, and there is something I know about every one of you and that's very central to your concerns. There is something that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world, on the street, that is the very mainspring of whatever they do and whatever they put up with. And that is that all of us want to be happy. In this, we are all together. How we imagine our happiness, that differs from one another, but it's already a lot that we have all in common, that we want to be happy.Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well, that's very easy. When you are happy, you are grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy, because they want something else or they want more of the same. And we all know people who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. So it is not happiness that makes us grateful. It's gratefulness that makes us happy. If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful, think again. It's gratefulness that makes you happy.Now, we can ask, what do we really mean by gratefulness? And how does it work? I appeal to your own experience. We all know from experience how it goes. We experience something that's valuable to us. Something is given to us that's valuable to us. And it's really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable, and it's a real gift. You haven't bought it. You haven't earned it. You haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it. It's just given to you. And when these two things come together, something that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given, then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That's how gratefulness happens.Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while. We cannot only have grateful experiences. We can be people who live gratefully. Grateful living, that is the thing. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say. It's a gift. You haven't earned it. You haven't brought it about in any way. You have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you, and yet, that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us, this moment, with all the opportunity that it contains. If we didn't have this present moment, we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything, and this moment is a gift. It's a given moment, as we say.Now, we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity. What you are really grateful for is the opportunity, not the thing that is given to you, because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it, to do something with it, you wouldn't be grateful for it. Opportunity is the gift within every gift, and we have this saying, opportunity knocks only once. Well, think again. Every moment is a new gift, over and over again, and if you miss the opportunity of this moment, another moment is given to us, and another moment. We can avail ourselves of this opportunity, or we can miss it, and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity, it is the key to happiness. Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands. Moment by moment, we can be grateful for this gift.Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence, for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn't say we can be grateful for everything. I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us. It isn't as bad as it might seem. Actually, when you look at it and experience it, you find that most of the time, what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy, and we only miss it because we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity.But once in a while, something very difficult is given to us, and when this difficult thing occurs to us, it's a challenge to rise to that opportunity, and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful. Learning patience, for instance. We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint, but is more like a marathon. That takes patience. That's difficult. It may be to stand up for your opinion, to stand up for your conviction. That's an opportunity that is given to us. To learn, to suffer, to stand up, all these opportunities are given to us, but they are opportunities, and those who avail themselves of those opportunities are the ones that we admire. They make something out of life. And those who fail get another opportunity. We always get another opportunity. That's the wonderful richness of life.So how can we find a method that will harness this? How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful, but moment by moment to be grateful. How can we do it? It's a very simple method. It's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street. Stop. Look. Go. That's all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life. We don't stop. We miss the opportunity because we don't stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs into our lives.When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back, I noticed water. In Africa where I was, I didn't have drinkable water. Every time I turned on the faucet, I was overwhelmed. Every time I clicked on the light, I was so grateful. It made me so happy. But after a while, this wears off. So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet, and every time I turned it on, water. So leave it up to your own imagination. You can find whatever works best for you, but you need stop signs in your life. And when you stop, then the next thing is to look. You look. You open your eyes. You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it, and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.And then we can also open our hearts, our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others, to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go, and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment. Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy, but sometimes it's something more difficult.But whatever it is, if we take this opportunity, we go with it, we are creative, those are the creative people. And that little stop, look, go, is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world. Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness, and you will be surprised if you \u2014 I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word \"gratefulness\" and \"gratitude\" comes up. Everywhere you find it, a grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness, a caf\u00e9 gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness. Yes, I have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called \"Thank You.\"(Laughter)There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world. It can change our world in immensely important ways, because if you're grateful, you're not fearful, and if you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you're grateful, you act out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity, and you are willing to share. If you are grateful, you are enjoying the differences between people, and you are respectful to everybody, and that changes this power pyramid under which we live.And it doesn't make for equality, but it makes for equal respect, and that is the important thing. The future of the world will be a network, not a pyramid turned upside down. The revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution, and it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes the very concept of a revolution, because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those who were on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before. What we need is a networking of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.A grateful world is a world of joyful people. Grateful people are joyful people, and joyful people \u2014 the more and more joyful people there are, the more and more we'll have a joyful world. We have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed. We couldn't understand why it mushroomed. We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something. And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade. People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world, and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop, look, go, to transform the world, to make it a happy place. And that is what I hope for us, and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same, stop, look, go.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1880, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:16.189\nThere is something you know about me,\n\n00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:20.029\nsomething very personal,\n\n00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.484\nand there is something\nI know about every one of you\n\n00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:27.456\nand that's very central to your concerns.\n\n00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:31.202\nThere is something that we know\n\n00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:37.260\nabout everyone we meet\nanywhere in the world, on the street,\n\n00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:42.238\nthat is the very mainspring\nof whatever they do\n\n00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:44.477\nand whatever they put up with.\n\n00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:51.260\nAnd that is that all of us\nwant to be happy.\n\n00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.637\nIn this, we are all together.\n\n00:00:55.161 --> 00:01:00.635\nHow we imagine our happiness,\nthat differs from one another,\n\n00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.463\nbut it's already a lot\nthat we have all in common,\n\n00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:07.701\nthat we want to be happy.\n\n00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:12.074\nNow my topic is gratefulness.\n\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.960\nWhat is the connection\nbetween happiness and gratefulness?\n\n00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:22.262\nMany people would say,\nwell, that's very easy.\n\n00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:24.804\nWhen you are happy, you are grateful.\n\n00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.799\nBut think again.\n\n00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:33.866\nIs it really the happy people\nthat are grateful?\n\n00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:38.576\nWe all know quite a number of people\n\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.777\nwho have everything\nthat it would take to be happy,\n\n00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.558\nand they are not happy,\n\n00:01:44.582 --> 00:01:48.297\nbecause they want something else\nor they want more of the same.\n\n00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:56.955\nAnd we all know people\nwho have lots of misfortune,\n\n00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.756\nmisfortune that we ourselves\nwould not want to have,\n\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.978\nand they are deeply happy.\n\n00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:06.951\nThey radiate happiness.

social change, not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that, but a new business model for social change, a new way of tackling the problem.In Britain, 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year. Now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit? Forty-three. And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison? Seven.So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice, and we said to the Ministry of Justice, what's it worth to you if fewer of these guys re-offend? It's got to be worth something, right? I mean, there's prison costs, there's police costs, there's court costs, all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth?Now, of course, we care about the social value. Social Finance, the organization I helped set up, cares about social stuff. But we wanted to make the economic case, because if we could make the economic case, then the value of doing this  would be completely compelling. And if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we've been successful at reducing that re-offending, then we can do something we think rather interesting.The idea is called the social impact bond. Now, the social impact bond is simply saying, if we can get the government to agree, that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked. So that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn't work, which for still quite a lot of bits of government, that's a serious issue.Now, many of you may have noticed there's a problem at this point, and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened. So we have to raise some money. We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors. Socially motivated investors: there's an interesting idea, right? But actually, there's a lot of people who, if they're given the chance, would love to invest in something that does social good. And here's the opportunity. Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model, not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again, but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims?So we find some investors, and they pay for a set of services, and if those services are successful, then they improve outcomes, and with those measured reductions in re-offending, government saves money, and with those savings, they can pay outcomes. And the investors do not just get their money back, but they make a return.So in March 2010, we signed the first social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice around Peterborough Prison. It was to work with 3,000 offenders split into three cohorts of 1,000 each. Now, each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison. They've got to have a year to commit their crimes, six months to get through the court system, and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer, as similar as possible, and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of 10-percent reduction, for every conviction event that didn't happen. So we get paid for crimes saved. Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction across all three cohorts, then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment, and if we do better than that, they can get up to 13 percent annualized return on their investment, which is okay.So everyone wins here, right? The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. Investors get two opportunities: for the first time, they can invest in social change. Also, they make a reasonable return, and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things, they're going to have to believers. They're going to have to care in the social program, but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years, then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product. The service providers, well, for the first time, they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years, not just one or two as often happens at the moment. Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims. Now, the offenders, they also benefit. Instead of just coming out of the prison with 46 pounds in their pocket, half of them not knowing where they're spending their first night out of jail, actually, someone meets them in prison, learns about their issues, meets them at the gate, takes them through to somewhere to stay, connects them to benefits, connects them to employment, drug rehabilitation, mental health, whatever's needed.So let's think of another example: working with children in care. Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people. So children in the state care tend to do very badly. Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level of five GCSEs at 16, against 58 percent of the wider population. More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care. And even more worryingly, and this is a Home Office statistic, 70 percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care. The state is not a great parent. But there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care, and 30 percent of kids going into care are adolescents.So we set up a program with Essex County Council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system. Essex only pays in the event that it's saving them care costs. Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds. That program started last month. Others, around homelessness in London, around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country. There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain, and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world. So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea. Obama has suggested 300 million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward, and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest.So what's caused this excitement? Why is this so different for people? Well, the first piece, which we've talked about, is innovation. It enables testing of new ideas in a way that's less difficult for everybody.The second piece it brings is rigor. By working to outcomes, people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one's dealing with. So taking Peterborough as an example, we add case management across all of the different organizations that we're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners, and at the same time they learn from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn, because we pushed for the data, what actually happens, whether they get re-arrested or not. And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.And this leads to the third element, which is new, and that's flexibility. Because normal contracting for things, when you're spending government money, you're spending our money, tax money, and the people who are in charge  of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it. Now any entrepreneur in the room knows that version 1.0, the business plan, is not the one that generally works. So when you're trying to do something like this, you need the flexibility to adapt the program. And again, in Peterborough, we started off with a program, but we also collected data, and over the period of time, we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements, so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term: greater engagement from the prisoners, longer-term engagement as well.The last element is partnership. There is, at the moment, a stale  debate going on very often: state's better, public sector's better, private sector's better, social sector's better, for a lot of these programs. Actually, for creating social change, we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work. And this creates a structure through which they can combine.So where does this leave us? This leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change. We've met thousands, possibly millions of people, who want the opportunity to invest in social change. We've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences. With this kind of model, we can help bring them together.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1881, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.915\nI'm here today to talk about social change,\n\n00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.198\nnot a new therapy or a new intervention\n\n00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:21.915\nor a new way of working with kids\nor something like that,\n\n00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.860\nbut a new business model for social change,\n\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.767\na new way of tackling the problem.\n\n00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.941\nIn Britain, 63 percent of all men\n\n00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:35.004\nwho come out of short sentences from prison\n\n00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.525\nre-offend again within a year.\n\n00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:40.143\nNow how many previous offenses\n\n00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:42.526\ndo you think they have on average\n\n00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:45.111\nmanaged to commit?\n\n00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.259\nForty-three.\n\n00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.922\nAnd how many previous times\ndo you think they've been in prison?\n\n00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.109\nSeven.\n\n00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.923\nSo we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,\n\n00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:56.811\nand we said to the Ministry of Justice,\n\n00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:59.163\nwhat's it worth to you\n\n00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:01.340\nif fewer of these guys re-offend?\n\n00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.509\nIt's got to be worth something, right?\n\n00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.336\nI mean, there's prison costs,\n\n00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:08.864\nthere's police costs, there's court costs,\n\n00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:11.596\nall these things that you're spending money on\n\n00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:14.109\nto deal with these guys.

paid for crimes saved.\n\n00:03:57.976 --> 00:04:02.080\nNow if we achieved that 10-percent reduction\n\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.765\nacross all three cohorts,\n\n00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:06.905\nthen the investors get a seven and a half percent\n\n00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:09.048\nannualized return on their investment,\n\n00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.588\nand if we do better than that,\n\n00:04:10.588

00:04:20.043\nSo everyone wins here, right?\n\n00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:22.758\nThe Ministry of Justice can try out a new program\n\n00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.201\nand they only pay if it

of just coming out of the prison\n\n00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:14.039\nwith 46 pounds in their pocket,\n\n00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.538\nhalf of them not knowing where they're spending\n\n00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:17.676\ntheir first night out of jail,\n\n00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:20.595\nactually, someone meets them in prison,\n\n00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:22.459\nlearns about their issues,\n\n00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:24.378\nmeets them at the gate,\n\n00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:27.131\ntakes them through to somewhere to stay,\n\n00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:29.549\nconnects them to benefits,\nconnects them to employment,\n\n00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:31.617\ndrug rehabilitation, mental health,\n\n00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:33.347\nwhatever's needed.\n\n00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:36.026\nSo let's think of another example:\n\n00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:37.916\nworking with children in care.\n\n00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:39.540\nSocial impact bonds work great\n\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.201\nfor any area where there is at the moment\n\n00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:44.600\nvery expensive provision that produces\n\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.174\npoor outcomes for people.\n\n00:05:46.174 --> 00:05:48.088\nSo children in the state care\n\n00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:50.523\ntend to do very badly.\n\n00:05:50.523 --> 00:05:54.448\nOnly 13 percent achieve a reasonable level\n\n00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:57.347\nof five GCSEs at 16,\n\n00:05:57.347 --> 00:05:59.817\nagainst 58 percent of the wider population.\n\n00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:03.476\nMore troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison\n\n00:06:03.476 --> 00:06:05.517\nhave spent some time in care.\n\n00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:06.809\nAnd even more worryingly,\n\n00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:08.781\nand this is a Home Office statistic,\n\n00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.681\n70 percent of prostitutes\n\n00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:12.865\nhave spent some time in care.\n\n00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:15.865\nThe state is not a great parent.\n\n00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.690\nBut there are great programs\n\n00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.702\nfor adolescents who are on the edge of care,\n\n00:06:21.702 --> 00:06:23.578\nand 30 percent of kids going into care\n\n00:06:23.578 --> 00:06:25.237\nare adolescents.\n\n00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:28.077\nSo we set up a program with Essex County Council\n\n00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:31.723\nto test out intensive family therapeutic support\n\n00:06:31.723 --> 00:06:34.763\nfor those families with adolescents\n\n00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:36.334\non the edge of the care system.\n\n00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:39.120\nEssex only pays in the event\n\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.902\nthat it's saving them care costs.\n\n00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.666\nInvestors have put in 3.1 million pounds.\n\n00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:46.924\nThat program started last month.\n\n00:06:46.924 --> 00:06:49.248\nOthers, around homelessness in London,\n\n00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:53.128\naround youth and employment and education\n\n00:06:53.128 --> 00:06:54.495\nelsewhere in the country.\n\n00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.850\nThere are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,\n\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.325\nand amazing levels of interest in this idea\n\n00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:01.848\nall over the world.\n\n00:07:01.848 --> 00:07:04.563\nSo David Cameron's put 20 million pounds\n\n00:07:04.563 --> 00:07:07.813\ninto a social outcomes fund to support this idea.\n\n00:07:07.813 --> 00:07:10.993\nObama has suggested 300 million dollars\n\n00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:14.526\nin the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas\n\n00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.212\nand structures to move it forward,\n\n00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:17.703\nand a lot of other countries\n\n00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.920\nare demonstrating considerable interest.\n\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.976\nSo what's caused this excitement?\n\n00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:24.495\nWhy is this so different for people?\n\n00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:26.987\nWell, the first piece, which we've talked about,\n\n00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:28.205\nis innovation.\n\n00:07:28.205 --> 00:07:31.403\nIt enables testing of new ideas\n\n00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:34.996\nin a way that's less difficult for everybody.\n\n00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.632\nThe second piece it brings is rigor.\n\n00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:40.925\nBy working to outcomes, people really have to test\n\n00:07:40.925 --> 00:07:44.794\nand bring data into the situation\nthat one's dealing with.\n\n00:07:44.803 --> 00:07:47.296\nSo taking Peterborough as an example,\n\n00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:49.519\nwe add case management\n\n00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.175\nacross all of the different organizations\nthat we're working with\n\n00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:53.460\nso they know\n\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.609\nwhat actually has been done with different prisoners,\n\n00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:57.678\nand at the same time they learn\n\n00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.104\nfrom the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,\n\n00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.839\nbecause we pushed for the data,\n\n00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:04.046\nwhat actually happens, whether\nthey get re-arrested or not.\n\n00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:07.334\nAnd we learn and adapt the program accordingly.\n\n00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:10.271\nAnd this leads to the third element, which is new,\n\n00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:12.373\nand that's flexibility.\n\n00:08:12.373 --> 00:08:15.486\nBecause normal contracting for things,\n\n00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:17.547\nwhen you're spending government money,\n\n00:08:17.547 --> 00:08:20.058\nyou're spending our money, tax money,\n\n00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:22.755\nand the people who are in charge \nof that are very aware of it\n\n00:08:22.755 --> 00:08:26.605\nso the temptation is to control\nexactly how you spend it.\n\n00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:29.658\nNow any entrepreneur in the room knows\n\n00:08:29.658 --> 00:08:31.755\nthat version 1.0, the business plan,\n\n00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:34.602\nis not the one that generally works.\n\n00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:36.905\nSo when you're trying to do something like this,\n\n00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:39.598\nyou need the flexibility to adapt the program.\n\n00:08:39.598 --> 00:08:42.310\nAnd again, in Peterborough, we started off\n\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.467\nwith a program, but we also collected data,\n\n00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:48.344\nand over the period of time,\n\n00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:50.542\nwe nuanced and changed that program\n\n00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:53.162\nto add a range of other elements,\n\n00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:54.927\nso that the service adapts\n\n00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:57.428\nand we meet the needs of the long term\n\n00:08:57.428 --> 00:08:59.492\nas well as the short term:\n\n00:08:59.492 --> 00:09:02.601\ngreater engagement from the prisoners,\n\n00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:05.380\nlonger-term engagement as well.\n\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.916\nThe last element is partnership.\n\n00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:11.093\nThere is, at the moment, a stale \ndebate going on very often:\n\n00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.218\nstate's better, public sector's better,\n\n00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:16.729\nprivate sector's better, social sector's better,\n\n00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:18.397\nfor a lot of these programs.\n\n00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:20.379\nActually, for creating social change,\n\n00:09:20.379 --> 00:09:22.118\nwe need to bring in the expertise\n\n00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:23.814\nfrom all of those parties\n\n00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.402\nin order to make this work.\n\n00:09:25.402 --> 00:09:27.445\nAnd this creates a structure\n\n00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:29.420\nthrough which they can combine.\n\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.352\nSo where does this leave us?\n\n00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:33.186\nThis leaves us with a way\n\n00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:36.173\nthat people can invest in social change.\n\n00:09:36.173 --> 00:09:39.160\nWe've met thousands, possibly millions of people,\n\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.593\nwho want the opportunity to invest in social change.\n\n00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:44.682\nWe've met champions all over the public sector\n\n00:09:44.682 --> 00:09:47.097\nkeen to make these kinds of differences.\n\n00:09:47.097 --> 00:09:48.882\nWith this kind of model,\n\n00:09:48.882 --> 00:09:50.818\nwe can help bring them together.\n\n00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:52.780\nThank you.\n\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.980\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Body parts on a chip", "duration": "803", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/geraldine_hamilton_body_parts_on_a_chip", "transcript": "We have a global health challenge in our hands today, and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly, takes far too long, and it fails more often than it succeeds. It really just isn't working, and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them, and diseases are going untreated. We seem to be spending more and more money. So for every billion dollars we spend in R&D, we're getting less drugs approved into the market. More money, less drugs. Hmm.So what's going on here? Well, there's a multitude of factors at play, but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work, whether it has efficacy, or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials, are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans. And we have two main tools available at our disposal. They are cells in dishes and animal testing.Now let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes. So, cells are happily functioning in our bodies. We take them and rip them out of their native environment, throw them in one of these dishes, and expect them to work. Guess what. They don't. They don't like that environment because it's nothing like what they have in the body.What about animal testing? Well, animals do and can provide extremely useful information. They teach us about what happens in the complex organism. We learn more about the biology itself. However, more often than not, animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they're treated with a particular drug.So we need better tools. We need human cells, but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body.Our bodies are dynamic environments. We're in constant motion. Our cells experience that. They're in dynamic environments in our body. They're under constant mechanical forces. So if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies, we need to become cell architects. We need to design, build and engineer a home away from home for the cells.And at the Wyss Institute, we've done just that. We call it an organ-on-a-chip. And I have one right here. It's beautiful, isn't it? But it's pretty incredible. Right here in my hand is a breathing, living human lung on a chip.And it's not just beautiful. It can do a tremendous amount of things. We have living cells in that little chip, cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types. There's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab. They've tried many different approaches. They've even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab. We're not trying to do that here. We're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry, the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies. So how does it work? Let me show you. We use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment. We have three fluidic channels. In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from, say, our lungs, and then underneath, they had capillary cells, the cells in our blood vessels. And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane, so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe. And they experience them how they did in the body. There's air flowing through the top channel, and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel. Now the chip is really beautiful, but what can we do with it? We can get incredible functionality inside these little chips. Let me show you. We could, for example, mimic infection, where we add bacterial cells into the lung. then we can add human white blood cells. White blood cells are our body's defense against bacterial invaders, and when they sense this inflammation due to infection, they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria. Well now you're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip. We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through, and when they detect that infection, they begin to stick. They stick, and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel. And you can see here, we can actually visualize a single white blood cell. It sticks, it wiggles its way through between the cell layers, through the pore, comes out on the other side of the membrane, and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green. In that tiny chip, you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection. It's the way we respond to \u2014 an immune response. It's pretty exciting.Now I want to share this picture with you, not just because it's so beautiful, but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips. It tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs, actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung. These structures are called cilia, and they actually move the mucus out of the lung. Yeah. Mucus. Yuck. But mucus is actually very important. Mucus traps particulates, viruses, potential allergens, and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out. When they get damaged, say, by cigarette smoke for example, they don't work properly, and they can't clear that mucus out. And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis. Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis. But now, with the functionality that we get in these chips, we can begin to look for potential new treatments.We didn't stop with the lung on a chip. We have a gut on a chip. You can see one right here. And we've put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip, and they're under constant peristaltic motion, this trickling flow through the cells, and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine. Now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals. It's really debilitating, and there aren't really many good treatments for it.Now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs. Now, the true power of this technology, however, really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them. There's fluid flowing across these cells, so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip. Now we're really getting excited. We're not going to ever recreate  a whole human in these chips, but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what's going to happen in humans. For example, now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug. Those of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler, we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs, how it enters the body, how it might affect, say, your heart. Does it change the beating of your heart? Does it have a toxicity? Does it get cleared by the liver? Is it metabolized in the liver? Is it excreted in your kidneys? We can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug.This could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry, but a whole host of different industries, including the cosmetics industry. We can potentially use the skin on a chip that we're currently developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you're using are actually  safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing. We could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment, such as chemicals in regular household cleaners. We could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure. We could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as SARS.Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future. Right now, the average participant in a clinical trial is that: average. Tends to be middle aged, tends to be female. You won't find many clinical trials in which children are involved, yet every day, we give children medications, and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults. Children are not adults. They may not respond in the same way adults do. There are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at-risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction. Now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations, put them on chips, and create populations on a chip. This could really change the way we do clinical trials. And this is the team and the people that are doing this. We have engineers, we have cell biologists, we have clinicians, all working together. We're really seeing something quite incredible at the Wyss Institute. It's really a convergence of disciplines, where biology is influencing the way we design, the way we engineer, the way we build. It's pretty exciting.We're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing. They're going to help us make, instead of one of these, millions of these chips, so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible. And this is key to the potential of that technology.Now let me show you our instrument. This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab, and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together. It does something else that's very important. It creates an easy user interface. So a cell biologist like me can come in, take a chip, put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there, put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D., and away you go. Plug and play. Easy.Now, let's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip, or your stem cells and put them on a chip. It would be a personalized chip just for you.Now all of us in here are individuals, and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs. I myself, a couple of years back, had a really bad headache, just couldn't shake it, thought,  \"Well, I'll try something different.\" I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later, I was on my way to the emergency room with a full-blown asthma attack. Now, obviously it wasn't fatal, but unfortunately, some of these adverse drug reactions can be fatal.So how do we prevent them? Well, we could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip, having Danielle on a chip, having you on a chip.Personalized medicine.

Hmm.\n\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.810\nSo what's going on here?\n\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.405\nWell, there's a multitude of factors at play,\n\n00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:02.426\nbut I think one of the key factors\n\n00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:04.823\nis that the tools that we currently have\n\n00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:08.906\navailable to test whether a drug is going to work,\n\n00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.295\nwhether it has efficacy,\n\n00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:12.061\nor whether it's going to be safe\n\n00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.613\nbefore we get it into human clinical trials,\n\n00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:17.764\nare failing us. They're not predicting\n\n00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.992\nwhat's going to happen in humans.\n\n00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:23.715\nAnd we have two main tools available\n\n00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:25.729\nat our disposal.\n\n00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.770\nThey are cells in dishes and animal testing.\n\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.090\nNow let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.\n\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.243\nSo, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.\n\n00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:38.298\nWe take them and rip them out\n\n00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.247\nof their native environment,\nthrow them in one of these dishes,\n\n00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:42.832\nand expect them to work.\n\n00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:45.025\nGuess what. They don't.\n\n00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:46.687\nThey don't like that environment\n\n00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:48.319\nbecause it's nothing like\n\n00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.995\nwhat they have in the body.\n\n00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:53.066\nWhat about animal testing?\n\n00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.951\nWell, animals do and can provide\n\n00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:58.213\nextremely useful information.\n\n00:01:58.213 --> 00:01:59.922\nThey teach us about what happens\n\n00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:02.251\nin the complex organism.\n\n00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:05.259\nWe learn more about the biology itself.\n\n00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.157\nHowever, more often than not,\n\n00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:12.373\nanimal models fail to predict\nwhat will happen in humans\n\n00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:15.559\nwhen they're treated with a particular drug.\n\n00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.938\nSo we need better tools.\n\n00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.691\nWe need human cells,\n\n00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:22.441\nbut we need to find a way to keep them happy\n\n00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.032\noutside the body.\n\n00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:26.938\nOur bodies are dynamic environments.\n\n00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.778\nWe're in constant motion.\n\n00:02:28.778 --> 00:02:30.969\nOur cells experience that.\n\n00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.778\nThey're in dynamic environments in our body.\n\n00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.533\nThey're under constant mechanical forces.\n\n00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.989\nSo if we want to make cells happy\n\n00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.418\noutside our bodies,\n\n00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:42.944\nwe need to become cell architects.\n\n00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:47.288\nWe need to design, build and engineer\n\n00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.519\na home away from home for the cells.\n\n00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.193\nAnd at the Wyss Institute,\n\n00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:54.131\nwe've done just that.\n\n00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:57.155\nWe call it an organ-on-a-chip.\n\n00:02:57.155 --> 00:02:58.946\nAnd I have one right here.\n\n00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:01.761\nIt's beautiful, isn't it?\nBut it's pretty incredible.\n\n00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:06.261\nRight here in my hand is a breathing, living\n\n00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:08.919\nhuman lung on a chip.\n\n00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.047\nAnd it's not just beautiful.\n\n00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:13.487\nIt can do a tremendous amount of things.\n\n00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:17.266\nWe have living cells in that little chip,\n\n00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:19.816\ncells that are in a dynamic environment\n\n00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.897\ninteracting with different cell types.\n\n00:03:22.897 --> 00:03:24.536\nThere's been many people\n\n00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.397\ntrying to grow cells in the lab.\n\n00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:29.553\nThey've tried many different approaches.\n\n00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:32.180\nThey've even tried to grow\nlittle mini-organs in the lab.\n\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.729\nWe're not trying to do that here.\n\n00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.855\nWe're simply trying to recreate\n\n00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:37.432\nin this tiny chip\n\n00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:40.449\nthe smallest functional unit\n\n00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.003\nthat represents the biochemistry,\n\n00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:46.127\nthe function and the mechanical strain\n\n00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:49.643\nthat the cells experience in our bodies.\n\n00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:52.675\nSo how does it work? Let me show you.\n\n00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:55.309\nWe use techniques from the computer chip\n\n00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:56.942\nmanufacturing industry\n\n00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:59.139\nto make these structures at a scale\n\n00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.035\nrelevant to both the cells and their environment.\n\n00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:04.099\nWe have three fluidic channels.\n\n00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.811\nIn the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane\n\n00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:09.874\non which we can add human cells\n\n00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:11.218\nfrom, say, our lungs,\n\n00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.705\nand then underneath, they had capillary cells,\n\n00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:15.493\nthe cells in our blood vessels.\n\n00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:19.813\nAnd we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip\n\n00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:22.642\nthat stretch and contract the membrane,\n\n00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:25.739\nso the cells experience the same mechanical forces\n\n00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:28.672\nthat they did when we breathe.\n\n00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:31.832\nAnd they experience them how they did in the body.\n\n00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:34.232\nThere's air flowing through the top channel,\n\n00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.581\nand then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients\n\n00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:40.420\nthrough the blood channel.\n\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.792\nNow the chip is really beautiful,\n\n00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:44.889\nbut what can we do with it?\n\n00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.213\nWe can get incredible functionality\n\n00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:48.964\ninside these little chips.\n\n00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:50.470\nLet me show you.\n\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.101\nWe could, for example, mimic infection,\n\n00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:56.637\nwhere we add bacterial cells into the lung.\n\n00:04:56.637 --> 00:04:59.569\nthen we can add human white blood cells.\n\n00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.160\nWhite blood cells are our body's defense\n\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.528\nagainst bacterial invaders,\n\n00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:06.697\nand when they sense this\ninflammation due to infection,\n\n00:05:06.697 --> 00:05:09.554\nthey will enter from the blood into the lung\n\n00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:11.469\nand engulf the bacteria.\n\n00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.717\nWell now you're going to see this happening\n\n00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:17.027\nlive in an actual human lung on a chip.\n\n00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:20.570\nWe've labeled the white blood cells\nso you can see them flowing through,\n\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.731\nand when they detect that infection,\n\n00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:24.128\nthey begin to stick.\n\n00:05:24.128 --> 00:05:28.015\nThey stick, and then they try to go into the lung\n\n00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:29.796\nside from blood channel.\n\n00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:33.485\nAnd you can see here, we can actually visualize\n\n00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:37.244\na single white blood cell.\n\n00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:39.500\nIt sticks, it wiggles its way through\n\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.815\nbetween the cell layers, through the pore,\n\n00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:44.236\ncomes out on the other side of the membrane,\n\n00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:47.671\nand right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria\n\n00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:49.320\nlabeled in green.\n\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.324\nIn that tiny chip, you just witnessed\n\n00:05:52.324 --> 00:05:55.505\none of the most fundamental responses\n\n00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:57.462\nour body has to an infection.\n\n00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:01.232\nIt's the way we respond to -- an immune response.\n\n00:06:01.232 --> 00:06:03.633\nIt's pretty exciting.\n\n00:06:03.633 --> 00:06:05.976\nNow I want to share this picture with you,\n\n00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:08.614\nnot just because it's so beautiful,\n\n00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:11.950\nbut because it tells us an enormous\namount of information\n\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.547\nabout what the cells are doing within the chips.\n\n00:06:14.547 --> 00:06:16.806\nIt tells us that these cells\n\n00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:19.117\nfrom the small airways in our lungs,\n\n00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:20.868\nactually have these hairlike structures\n\n00:06:20.868 --> 00:06:22.876\nthat you would expect to see in the lung.\n\n00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:24.341\nThese structures are called cilia,\n\n00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:27.251\nand they actually move the mucus out of the lung.\n\n00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:28.790\nYeah. Mucus. Yuck.\n\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.230\nBut mucus is actually very important.\n\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.811\nMucus traps particulates, viruses,\n\n00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:35.270\npotential allergens,\n\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.871\nand these little cilia move\n\n00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:39.121\nand clear the mucus out.\n\n00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:41.033\nWhen they get damaged, say,\n\n00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.452\nby cigarette smoke for example,\n\n00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:46.260\nthey don't work properly,\nand they can't clear that mucus out.\n\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.077\nAnd that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.\n\n00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:52.724\nCilia and the clearance of mucus\n\n00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:57.185\nare also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.\n\n00:06:57.185 --> 00:07:00.735\nBut now, with the functionality\nthat we get in these chips,\n\n00:07:00.735 --> 00:07:02.559\nwe can begin to look\n\n00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.072\nfor potential new treatments.\n\n00:07:05.072 --> 00:07:07.024\nWe didn't stop with the lung on a chip.\n\n00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:08.908\nWe have a gut on a chip.\n\n00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:10.938\nYou can see one right here.\n\n00:07:10.938 --> 00:07:14.164\nAnd we've put intestinal human cells\n\n00:07:14.164 --> 00:07:16.069\nin a gut on a chip,\n\n00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:18.906\nand they're under constant peristaltic motion,\n\n00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:22.097\nthis trickling flow through the cells,\n\n00:07:22.097 --> 00:07:24.655\nand we can mimic many of the functions\n\n00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:26.918\nthat you actually would expect to see\n\n00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:28.611\nin the human intestine.\n\n00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.402\nNow we can begin to create models of diseases\n\n00:07:32.402 --> 00:07:34.812\nsuch as irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:36.894\nThis is a disease that affects\n\n00:07:36.894 --> 00:07:38.805\na large number of individuals.\n\n00:07:38.805 --> 00:07:40.579\nIt's really debilitating,\n\n00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:44.521\nand there aren't really many good treatments for it.\n\n00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:46.823\nNow we have a whole pipeline\n\n00:07:46.823 --> 00:07:49.102\nof different organ chips\n\n00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:52.834\nthat we are currently working on in our labs.\n\n00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:56.253\nNow, the true power of this technology, however,\n\n00:07:56.253 --> 00:07:58.378\nreally comes from the fact\n\n00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:00.923\nthat we can fluidically link them.\n\n00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:02.870\nThere's fluid flowing across these cells,\n\n00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.949\nso we can begin to interconnect\n\n00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.811\nmultiple different chips together\n\n00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:12.024\nto form what we call a virtual human on a chip.\n\n00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:15.033\nNow we're really getting excited.\n\n00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:19.128\nWe're not going to ever recreate \na whole human in these chips,\n\n00:08:19.128 --> 00:08:23.297\nbut what our goal is is to be able to recreate\n\n00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:25.310\nsufficient functionality\n\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.670\nso that we can make better predictions\n\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.884\nof what's going to happen in humans.\n\n00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.808\nFor example, now we can begin to explore\n\n00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:36.242\nwhat happens when we put\na drug like an aerosol drug.\n\n00:08:36.242 --> 00:08:39.228\nThose of you like me who have asthma,\nwhen you take your inhaler,\n\n00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:42.154\nwe can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,\n\n00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.780\nhow it enters the body,\n\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.534\nhow it might affect, say, your heart.\n\n00:08:45.534 --> 00:08:47.442\nDoes it change the beating of your heart?\n\n00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:49.083\nDoes it have a toxicity?\n\n00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.091\nDoes it get cleared by the liver?\n\n00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:53.243\nIs it metabolized in the liver?\n\n00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:55.134\nIs it excreted in your kidneys?\n\n00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:57.346\nWe can begin to study the dynamic\n\n00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:59.971\nresponse of the body to a drug.\n\n00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:01.905\nThis could really revolutionize\n\n00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:03.554\nand be a game changer\n\n00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:06.492\nfor not only the pharmaceutical industry,\n\n00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:08.865\nbut a whole host of different industries,\n\n00:09:08.865 --> 00:09:11.265\nincluding the cosmetics industry.\n\n00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:14.147\nWe can potentially use the skin on a chip\n\n00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:16.108\nthat we're currently developing in the lab\n\n00:09:16.108 --> 00:09:18.662\nto test whether the ingredients in those products\n\n00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:21.945\nthat you're using are actually \nsafe to put on your skin\n\n00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:24.634\nwithout the need for animal testing.\n\n00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:26.578\nWe could test the safety\n\n00:09:26.578 --> 00:09:28.831\nof chemicals that we are exposed to\n\n00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:30.745\non a daily basis in our environment,\n\n00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:34.476\nsuch as chemicals in regular household cleaners.\n\n00:09:34.476 --> 00:09:37.678\nWe could also use the organs on chips\n\n00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:40.457\nfor applications in bioterrorism\n\n00:09:40.457 --> 00:09:43.028\nor radiation exposure.\n\n00:09:43.028 --> 00:09:46.378\nWe could use them to learn more about\n\n00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.422\ndiseases such as ebola\n\n00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:53.314\nor other deadly diseases such as SARS.\n\n00:09:53.314 --> 00:09:55.152\nOrgans on chips could also change\n\n00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:58.526\nthe way we do clinical trials in the future.\n\n00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:01.113\nRight now, the average participant\n\n00:10:01.113 --> 00:10:04.483\nin a clinical trial is that: average.\n\n00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:07.809\nTends to be middle aged, tends to be female.\n\n00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:10.281\nYou won't find many clinical trials\n\n00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:11.796\nin which children are involved,\n\n00:10:11.796 --> 00:10:15.343\nyet every day, we give children medications,\n\n00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:19.089\nand the only safety data we have on that drug\n\n00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:22.163\nis one that we obtained from adults.\n\n00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.957\nChildren are not adults.\n\n00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.090\nThey may not respond in the same way adults do.\n\n00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.502\nThere are other things like genetic differences\n\n00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:30.935\nin populations\n\n00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:34.041\nthat may lead to at-risk populations\n\n00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:37.478\nthat are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.\n\n00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:40.867\nNow imagine if we could take cells\nfrom all those different populations,\n\n00:10:40.877 --> 00:10:42.785\nput them on chips,\n\n00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:44.749\nand create populations on a chip.\n\n00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:46.587\nThis could really change the way\n\n00:10:46.587 --> 00:10:48.656\nwe do clinical trials.\n\n00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:51.488\nAnd this is the team and the people\nthat are doing this.\n\n00:10:51.488 --> 00:10:54.745\nWe have engineers, we have cell biologists,\n\n00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:58.519\nwe have clinicians, all working together.\n\n00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.445\nWe're really seeing something quite incredible\n\n00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:02.050\nat the Wyss Institute.\n\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.221\nIt's really a convergence of disciplines,\n\n00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:07.941\nwhere biology is influencing the way we design,\n\n00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:10.603\nthe way we engineer, the way we build.\n\n00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.006\nIt's pretty exciting.\n\n00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:15.570\nWe're establishing important industry collaborations\n\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.943\nsuch as the one we have with a company\n\n00:11:18.943 --> 00:11:22.542\nthat has expertise in large-scale\ndigital manufacturing.\n\n00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:24.561\nThey're going to help us make,\n\n00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:26.087\ninstead of one of these,\n\n00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:27.670\nmillions of these chips,\n\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.339\nso that we can get them into the hands\n\n00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:32.228\nof as many researchers as possible.\n\n00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:36.444\nAnd this is key to the potential of that technology.\n\n00:11:36.444 --> 00:11:38.981\nNow let me show you our instrument.\n\n00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:40.970\nThis is an instrument that our engineers\n\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.588\nare actually prototyping right now in the lab,\n\n00:11:43.588 --> 00:11:45.897\nand this instrument is going to give us\n\n00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:48.356\nthe engineering controls that we're going to require\n\n00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:52.524\nin order to link 10 or more organ chips together.\n\n00:11:52.524 --> 00:11:54.753\nIt does something else that's very important.\n\n00:11:54.753 --> 00:11:57.597\nIt creates an easy user interface.\n\n00:11:57.597 --> 00:12:00.587\nSo a cell biologist like me can come in,\n\n00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.595\ntake a chip, put it in a cartridge\n\n00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:04.527\nlike the prototype you see there,\n\n00:12:04.527 --> 00:12:06.598\nput the cartridge into the machine\n\n00:12:06.598 --> 00:12:08.086\njust like you would a C.D.,\n\n00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:09.218\nand away you go.\n\n00:12:09.218 --> 00:12:11.967\nPlug and play. Easy.\n\n00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:14.481\nNow, let's imagine a little bit\n\n00:12:14.481 --> 00:12:15.860\nwhat the future might look like\n\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.273\nif I could take your stem cells\n\n00:12:18.273 --> 00:12:19.713\nand put them on a chip,\n\n00:12:19.713 --> 00:12:22.932\nor your stem cells and put them on a chip.\n\n00:12:22.932 --> 00:12:26.433\nIt would be a personalized chip just for you.\n\n00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:29.641\nNow all of us in here are individuals,\n\n00:12:29.641 --> 00:12:32.479\nand those individual differences mean\n\n00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:34.921\nthat we could react very differently\n\n00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:39.168\nand sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.\n\n00:12:39.168 --> 00:12:43.736\nI myself, a couple of years back,\nhad a really bad headache,\n\n00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:46.149\njust couldn't shake it, thought, \n\"Well, I'll try something different.\"\n\n00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:48.284\nI took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,\n\n00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:50.164\nI was on my way to the emergency room\n\n00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:52.057\nwith a full-blown asthma attack.\n\n00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:53.887\nNow, obviously it wasn't fatal,\n\n00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:57.060\nbut unfortunately, some of these\n\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.669\nadverse drug reactions can be fatal.\n\n00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:02.610\nSo how do we prevent them?\n\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.190\nWell, we could imagine one day\n\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.533\nhaving Geraldine on a chip,\n\n00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:09.282\nhaving Danielle on a chip,\n\n00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:10.755\nhaving you on a chip.\n\n00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:13.143\nPersonalized medicine. Thank you.\n\n00:13:13.143 --> 00:13:17.297\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Let\u2019s try emotional correctness", "duration": "359", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sally_kohn_let_s_try_emotional_correctness", "transcript": "So when I do my job, people hate me. In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me. And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker. I am a progressive, lesbian talking head on Fox News.(Applause)So y'all heard that, right? Just to make sure, right? I am a gay talking head on Fox News. I am going to tell you how I do it, and the most important thing I've learned.So I go on television. I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in \u2014 in some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist. It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids, with a live television audience of millions. It's totally almost just like that.And that's just on air. The hate mail I get is unbelievable. Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count. I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge, a cunt and an ugly man, and that was just in one email.(Laughter)So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness? Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness, but what matters more is emotional correctness. Let me give you a small example. I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't. I care about two things. One, I care that you spell it right.(Laughter) (Applause)Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E. You'd totally be surprised. And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it. Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive? Or do you really want to hurt me personally?Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling, how we say what we say, the respect and compassion we show one another. And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct.So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging. That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct. But liberals on my side, we can be self-righteous, we can be condescending, we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us. In other words, we can be politically right but emotionally wrong. And incidentally, that means that people don't like us. Right?Now here's the kicker. Conservatives are really nice. I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail, but you would be surprised. Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates, and I know that if I ever had a problem, he would do anything he could to help. Now, I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong, but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive. And that's why people listen to him. Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first. We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements. And if we can start to find compassion for one another, then we have a shot at building common ground. It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here, but when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful.So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known. Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame. Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us. That is emotional correctness.I'm not saying it's easy. An average of, like, 5.6 times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities. This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me, and I ain't the Dalai Lama. I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic. Because I don't just get hate mail. I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them. And one of my all-time favorites begins: \"I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic,(Laughter)but I'm a big fan of you as a person.\" Now this guy doesn't agree with me \u2014 yet.(Laughter)But he's listening \u2014 not because of what I said, but because of how I said it.

NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts, and last year, they invited us along for the ride. All the footage was taken from our open ROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage.So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside. It's open source, meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online, allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design. It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic. So ROVs aren't new. They've been around for decades. Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans. Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction. What we've built isn't unique. It's how we've built it that's really unique.So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started. So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. We had heard this story about lost gold from a Gold Rush-era robbery, and we wanted to go up there. Unfortunately, we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, but we didn't have all the parts figured out, so we did what anybody would do in our situation: we asked the Internet for help. More specifically, we created this website, openROV.com, and shared  our intentions and our plans For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums, but pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists, and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. We kept working on it. We learned a lot. We kept prototyping, and eventually, we decided we wanted to go  to the cave. We were ready.So about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times. And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves.So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter, and when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours, and all of a sudden,  had this money to make these kits. But then we had to learn how to make them. I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing. So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made, thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us, and we shipped these kits all over the world just before Christmas of last year, so it was just a few months ago. But we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world, including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica. We've also learned the penguins love robots. (Laughter)So we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves. That's the only way that we could have done this. By being open source, we've created this distributed R&D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart. But the actual robot is really only half the story. The real potential, the long term potential, is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas?So you're probably all wondering: the cave. Did you find the gold? Well, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration. It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in.

We were ready.\n\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.800\nSo about that time, our little expedition\nbecame quite a story,\n\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.821\nand it got picked up in The New York Times.\n\n00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:33.633\nAnd we were pretty much just overwhelmed\n\n00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:35.416\nwith interest from people who wanted a kit\n\n00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.937\nthat they could build this open ROV themselves.\n\n00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:41.226\nSo we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,\n\n00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:42.458\nand when we did,\n\n00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:44.533\nwe raised our funding goal in about two hours,\n\n00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:47.738\nand all of a sudden, \nhad this money to make these kits.\n\n00:02:47.738 --> 00:02:49.933\nBut then we had to learn how to make them.\n\n00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.098\nI mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.\n\n00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.358\nSo we quickly learned that our garage\n\n00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:58.037\nwas not big enough to hold our growing operation.\n\n00:02:58.037 --> 00:03:00.193\nBut we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,\n\n00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:02.900\nthanks a lot to TechShop,\nwhich was a big help to us,\n\n00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.885\nand we shipped these kits all over the world\n\n00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.714\njust before Christmas of last year,\n\n00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:09.496\nso it was just a few months ago.\n\n00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.404\nBut we're already starting to get video\n\n00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.002\nand photos back from all over the world,\n\n00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:16.032\nincluding this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.\n\n00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:19.432\nWe've also learned the penguins love robots.\n\n00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.445\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:24.613\nSo we're still publishing all the designs online,\n\n00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:26.731\nencouraging anyone to build these themselves.\n\n00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:29.134\nThat's the only way that we could have done this.\n\n00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:30.793\nBy being open source, we've created\n\n00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:33.057\nthis distributed R&amp;D network,\n\n00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:36.853\nand we're moving faster than\nany venture-backed counterpart.\n\n00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:40.058\nBut the actual robot is really only half the story.\n\n00:03:40.058 --> 00:03:42.554\nThe real potential, the long term potential,\n\n00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.231\nis with this community of DIY ocean explorers\n\n00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:47.627\nthat are forming all over the globe.\n\n00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.161\nWhat can we discover\n\n00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.065\nwhen there's thousands of these devices\n\n00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:53.111\nroaming the seas?\n\n00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.387\nSo you're probably all wondering: the cave.\n\n00:03:55.387 --> 00:03:57.213\nDid you find the gold?\n\n00:03:57.213 --> 00:03:58.765\nWell, we didn't find any gold,\n\n00:03:58.765 --> 00:04:01.994\nbut we decided that what we found\nwas much more valuable.\n\n00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:04.466\nIt was the glimpse into a potential future\n\n00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.141\nfor ocean exploration.\n\n00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:09.051\nIt's something that's not limited to\nthe James Camerons of the world,\n\n00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:11.646\nbut something that we're all participating in.\n\n00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:12.979\nIt's an underwater world\n\n00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.490\nwe're all exploring together.\n\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.665\nThank you.\n\n00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.665\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why buses represent democracy in action", "duration": "857", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/enrique_penalosa_why_buses_represent_democracy_in_action", "transcript": "Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge, because different from health or education or housing, it tends to get worse as societies become richer. Clearly, a unsustainable model. Mobility, as most other developing country problems, more than a matter of money or technology, is a matter of equality, equity. The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see, for example, that in terms of transport, an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport. Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam, more than 30 percent of the population uses bicycles, despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States. There is a conflict in developing world cities for money, for government investment. If more money is invested in highways, of course there is less money for housing, for schools, for hospitals, and also there is a conflict for space. There is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them. Most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society's resources. However, there is a problem with that, that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work. Some people must make more money, some others less. Some companies succeed. Others fail. Then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy?I would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities. The first one is equality of quality of life, especially for children, that all children should have, beyond the obvious health and education, access to green spaces, to sports facilities, to swimming pools, to music lessons. And the second kind of equality is one which we could call \"democratic equality.\" The first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law. That is not just poetry. It's a very powerful principle. For example, if that is true, a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one.We have been so used to inequality, sometimes, that it's before our noses and we do not see it. Less than 100 years ago, women could not vote, and it seemed normal, in the same way that it seems normal today to see a bus in traffic. In fact, when I became mayor, applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest, that a bus with 100 people has a right to 100 times more road space than a car, we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes. We called it TransMilenio, in order to make buses sexier. And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol, because as buses zoom by, expensive cars stuck in traffic, it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work. In fact, it's not just a matter of equity. It doesn't take Ph.D.'s. A committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses. In fact, buses are not sexy, but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities. They also have great capacity. For example, this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China, except for one line in Beijing, at a fraction of the cost.We fought not just for space for buses, but we fought for space for people, and that was even more difficult. Cities are human habitats, and we humans are pedestrians. Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run, we need to walk. There is a really enormous conflict, when we are talking about developing country cities, between pedestrians and cars. Here, what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy. What this shows is that people who walk are third-class citizens while those who go in cars are first-class citizens. In terms of transport infrastructure, what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks. Here they made a flyover, probably very useless, and they forgot to make a sidewalk. This is prevailing all over the world. Not even schoolchildren are more important than cars.In my city of Bogot\u00e1, we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars, which had been parking on sidewalks for decades, in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings, and to make space for protected bikeways. First of all, I had black hair before that. (Laughter) And I was almost impeached in the process. It is a very difficult battle. However, it was possible, finally, after very difficult battles, to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity, that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars. Indeed, a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city, which is road space. A city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space. How to distribute it between pedestrians, bicycles, public transport and cars? This is not a technological issue, and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution.We also built, and this was 15 years ago, before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London, it was a very difficult battle as well, more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways. I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature. They are a right, just as sidewalks are, unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility, without the risk of getting killed. And just as busways are, protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy, because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle is equally important to one in a $30,000 car.And we are living in a unique moment in history. In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities which will exist in the year 2060 will be built. In many developing country cities, more than 80 and 90 percent of the city which will exist in 2060 will be built over the next four or five decades.But this is not just a matter for developing country cities. In the United States, for example, more than 70 million new homes must be built over the next 40 or 50 years. That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain, France and Canada put together. And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws, and that different, better ones could be built.What is wrong with our cities today? Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today, \"Watch out, a car,\" the child will jump in fright, and with a very good reason, because there are more than 10,000 children who are killed by cars every year in the world. We have had cities for 8,000 years, and children could walk out of home and play. In fact, only very recently, towards 1900, there were no cars. Cars have been here for really less than 100 years. They completely changed cities. In 1900, for example, nobody was killed by cars in the United States. Only 20 years later, between 1920 and 1930, almost 200,000 people were killed by cars in the United States. Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children were killed by cars in the United States. So we could make different cities, cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars, that will give more public space to human beings than to cars, cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens, such as children or the elderly.I will propose to you a couple of ingredients which I think would make cities much better, and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created. Hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss-crossing cities in all directions. Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces. They could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways, sort of bicycle highways, and I would invite you to imagine the following: a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles. In new cities which are going to be built, this would not be particularly difficult. When I was mayor of Bogot\u00e1, in only three years, we were able to create 70 kilometers, in one of the most dense cities in the world, of these bicycle highways. And this changes the way people live, move, enjoy the city. In this picture, you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods, we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street, and the cars still in the mud. Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars. But what do we do first? Ninety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars. But you see, when a city is only being created, it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure. Then the city grows around it. And of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it, and it changes the way of life.And the second ingredient, which would solve mobility, that very difficult challenge in developing countries, in a very low-cost and simple way, would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses, buses and bicycles and pedestrians. This would be, again, a very low-cost solution if implemented from the start, low cost, pleasant transit with natural sunlight.But unfortunately, reality is not as good as my dreams. Because of private property of land and high land prices, all developing country cities have a large problem of slums. In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments. And of course it's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments. But even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places, very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low-cost, high-frequency public transport. As a Latin American, and Latin America was the most recently organized region in the world, I would recommend, respectfully, passionately, to those countries which are yet to urbanize \u2014 Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950 to 80 percent urban in 2010 \u2014 I would recommend Asian and African countries which are yet to urbanize, such as India which is only 33 percent urban now, that governments should acquire all land around cities. In this way, their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces, with the parks, with the greenways, with the busways.The cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future. What a fantastic opportunity for leaders and many young leaders to come, especially in the developing countries. They can create a much happier life for billions towards the future. I am sure, I am optimistic, that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams.(Applause)", "id": 1886, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:15.336\nMobility in developing world cities\n\n00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:17.494\nis a very peculiar challenge,\n\n00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:19.299\nbecause different from health\n\n00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:21.609\nor education or housing,\n\n00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.043\nit tends to get worse as societies become richer.\n\n00:00:25.043 --> 00:00:27.827\nClearly, a unsustainable model.\n\n00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:32.154\nMobility, as most other developing country problems,\n\n00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:36.059\nmore than a matter of money or technology,\n\n00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.450\nis a matter of equality, equity.\n\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.559\nThe great inequality in developing countries\n\n00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.984\nmakes it difficult to see, for example,\n\n00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:50.548\nthat in terms of transport,\n\n00:00:50.548 --> 00:00:52.478\nan advanced city is not one\n\n00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:54.500\nwhere even the poor use cars,\n\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.523\nbut rather one where even the rich\n\n00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.747\nuse public transport.\n\n00:00:58.747 --> 00:01:02.313\nOr bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,\n\n00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:04.343\nmore than 30 percent of the population\n\n00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:05.878\nuses bicycles,\n\n00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:07.776\ndespite the fact that the Netherlands has\n\n00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:11.759\na higher income per capita than the United States.\n\n00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.616\nThere is a conflict in developing world cities\n\n00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:18.184\nfor money, for government investment.\n\n00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:20.685\nIf more money is invested in highways,\n\n00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.697\nof course there is less money for housing,\n\n00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:25.054\nfor schools, for hospitals,\n\n00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:29.030\nand also there is a conflict for space.\n\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.456\nThere is a conflict for space between\n\n00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:33.981\nthose with cars and those without them.\n\n00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:35.824\nMost of us accept today\n\n00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.608\nthat private property and a market economy\n\n00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:41.806\nis the best way to manage\nmost of society's resources.\n\n00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:44.211\nHowever, there is a problem with that,\n\n00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:46.879\nthat market economy needs\n\n00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:49.597\ninequality of income in order to work.\n\n00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:51.139\nSome people must make more money,\n\n00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:52.690\nsome others less.\n\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.259\nSome companies succeed. Others fail.\n\n00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.133\nThen what kind of equality\n\n00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.738\ncan we hope for today\n\n00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:00.660\nwith a market economy?\n\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.596\nI would propose two kinds\n\n00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:04.950\nwhich both have much to do with cities.\n\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.056\nThe first one is equality of quality of life,\n\n00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:09.844\nespecially for children,\n\n00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.499\nthat all children should have,\n\n00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.506\nbeyond the obvious health and education,\n\n00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:18.365\naccess to green spaces, to sports facilities,\n\n00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:21.391\nto swimming pools, to music lessons.\n\n00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.882\nAnd the second kind of equality\n\n00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:28.165\nis one which we could call \"democratic equality.\"\n\n00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:31.114\nThe first article in every constitution states\n\n00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:34.403\nthat all citizens are equal before the law.\n\n00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:36.858\nThat is not just poetry.\n\n00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:39.059\nIt's a very powerful principle.\n\n00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.645\nFor example, if that is true,\n\n00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:43.530\na bus with 80 passengers\n\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.259\nhas a right to 80 times more road space\n\n00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.131\nthan a car with one.\n\n00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:53.524\nWe have been so used to inequality, sometimes,\n\n00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:57.255\nthat it's before our noses and we do not see it.\n\n00:02:57.255 --> 00:02:59.531\nLess than 100 years ago,\n\n00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.918\nwomen could not vote,\n\n00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:03.124\nand it seemed normal,\n\n00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:06.808\nin the same way that it seems normal today\n\n00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:09.740\nto see a bus in traffic.\n\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.691\nIn fact, when I became mayor,\n\n00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.659\napplying that democratic principle\n\n00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.071\nthat public good prevails over private interest,\n\n00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.971\nthat a bus with 100 people\n\n00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.545\nhas a right to 100 times\nmore road space than a car,\n\n00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:26.559\nwe implemented a mass transit system\n\n00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.028\nbased on buses in exclusive lanes.\n\n00:03:29.028 --> 00:03:33.470\nWe called it TransMilenio,\nin order to make buses sexier.\n\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.267\nAnd one thing is that it is also a very beautiful\ndemocratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,\n\n00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:45.431\nexpensive cars stuck in traffic,\n\n00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:51.758\nit clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.\n\n00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:55.587\nIn fact, it's not just a matter of equity.\n\n00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:57.479\nIt doesn't take Ph.D.'s.\n\n00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.751\nA committee of 12-year-old children\n\n00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:01.757\nwould find out in 20 minutes\n\n00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:05.461\nthat the most efficient way to use scarce road space\n\n00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.945\nis with exclusive lanes for buses.\n\n00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:12.267\nIn fact, buses are not sexy,\n\n00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:15.414\nbut they are the only possible means\n\n00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:18.697\nto bring mass transit to all areas\n\n00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:22.372\nof fast growing developing cities.\n\n00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:24.547\nThey also have great capacity.\n\n00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:27.291\nFor example, this system in Guangzhou\n\n00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.996\nis moving more passengers our direction\n\n00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:32.820\nthan all subway lines in China,\n\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.311\nexcept for one line in Beijing,\n\n00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.648\nat a fraction of the cost.\n\n00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:41.762\nWe fought not just for space for buses,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.818\nbut we fought for space for people,\n\n00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:48.031\nand that was even more difficult.\n\n00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:50.816\nCities are human habitats,\n\n00:04:50.816 --> 00:04:54.545\nand we humans are pedestrians.\n\n00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:57.609\nJust as fish need to swim or birds need to fly\n\n00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:00.401\nor deer need to run, we need to walk.\n\n00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:03.732\nThere is a really enormous conflict,\n\n00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:06.733\nwhen we are talking about developing country cities,\n\n00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:09.412\nbetween pedestrians and cars.\n\n00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:12.343\nHere, what you see is a picture that shows\n\n00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:13.995\ninsufficient democracy.\n\n00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.087\nWhat this shows is that people who walk\n\n00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:18.762\nare third-class citizens\n\n00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:20.097\nwhile those who go in cars\n\n00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:21.912\nare first-class citizens.\n\n00:05:21.912 --> 00:05:24.319\nIn terms of transport infrastructure,\n\n00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.522\nwhat really makes a difference\n\n00:05:25.522 --> 00:05:28.068\nbetween advanced and backward cities\n\n00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:30.160\nis not highways or subways\n\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.424\nbut quality sidewalks.\n\n00:05:32.424 --> 00:05:35.190\nHere they made a flyover, probably very useless,\n\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.148\nand they forgot to make a sidewalk.\n\n00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:41.472\nThis is prevailing all over the world.\n\n00:05:41.472 --> 00:05:45.257\nNot even schoolchildren\nare more important than cars.\n\n00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:47.498\nIn my city of Bogot\u00e1,\n\n00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:50.852\nwe fought a very difficult battle\n\n00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:53.626\nin order to take space from cars,\n\n00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:56.522\nwhich had been parking on sidewalks for decades,\n\n00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.637\nin order to make space for people that should reflect\n\n00:05:59.637 --> 00:06:01.305\ndignity of human beings,\n\n00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:04.154\nand to make space for protected bikeways.\n\n00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:06.899\nFirst of all, I had black hair before that.\n\n00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.875\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:12.131\nAnd I was almost impeached in the process.\n\n00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:14.275\nIt is a very difficult battle.\n\n00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:17.452\nHowever, it was possible, finally,\n\n00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:20.690\nafter very difficult battles, to make a city\n\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.374\nthat would reflect some respect for human dignity,\n\n00:06:23.374 --> 00:06:25.169\nthat would show that those who walk are equally\n\n00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.990\nimportant to those who have cars.\n\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.639\nIndeed, a very important ideological\nand political issue anywhere\n\n00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.585\nis how to distribute that most valuable resource\n\n00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:36.994\nof a city, which is road space.\n\n00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:39.831\nA city could find oil or diamonds underground\n\n00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:41.922\nand it would not be so valuable as road space.\n\n00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:45.083\nHow to distribute it between pedestrians,\n\n00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:48.185\nbicycles, public transport and cars?\n\n00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:50.976\nThis is not a technological issue,\n\n00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:54.500\nand we should remember that in no constitution\n\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.821\nparking is a constitutional right\n\n00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:59.322\nwhen we make that distribution.\n\n00:06:59.322 --> 00:07:02.953\nWe also built, and this was 15 years ago,\n\n00:07:02.953 --> 00:07:04.891\nbefore there were bikeways in New York\n\n00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.335\nor in Paris or in London,\n\n00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:08.782\nit was a very difficult battle as well,\n\n00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:13.602\nmore than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.\n\n00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:15.526\nI don't think protected bicycle ways\n\n00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:18.280\nare a cute architectural feature.\n\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.986\nThey are a right, just as sidewalks are,\n\n00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:23.184\nunless we believe that only those\n\n00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:25.518\nwith access to a motor vehicle\n\n00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:27.585\nhave a right to safe mobility,\n\n00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.858\nwithout the risk of getting killed.\n\n00:07:29.858 --> 00:07:33.525\nAnd just as busways are,\n\n00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:35.616\nprotected bikeways also are\n\n00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:37.495\na powerful symbol of democracy,\n\n00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:41.145\nbecause they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle\n\n00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:43.567\nis equally important\n\n00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:47.509\nto one in a $30,000 car.\n\n00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.226\nAnd we are living in a unique moment in history.\n\n00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:55.678\nIn the next 50 years, more than half of those cities\n\n00:07:55.678 --> 00:08:00.240\nwhich will exist in the year 2060 will be built.\n\n00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.538\nIn many developing country cities,\n\n00:08:02.538 --> 00:08:04.598\nmore than 80 and 90 percent\n\n00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:09.300\nof the city which will exist in 2060\n\n00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.661\nwill be built over the next four or five decades.\n\n00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.783\nBut this is not just a matter\nfor developing country cities.\n\n00:08:14.783 --> 00:08:16.772\nIn the United States, for example,\n\n00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:19.437\nmore than 70 million new homes\n\n00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:22.134\nmust be built over the next 40 or 50 years.\n\n00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:25.207\nThat's more than all the homes that today exist\n\n00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:29.723\nin Britain, France and Canada put together.\n\n00:08:29.723 --> 00:08:33.080\nAnd I believe that our cities today\n\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.195\nhave severe flaws,\n\n00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:38.753\nand that different, better ones could be built.\n\n00:08:38.753 --> 00:08:41.201\nWhat is wrong with our cities today?\n\n00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:45.435\nWell, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child\n\n00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:47.140\nwho is barely learning to speak\n\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.651\nin any city in the world today,\n\n00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:50.333\n\"Watch out, a car,\"\n\n00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:52.895\nthe child will jump in fright,\n\n00:08:52.895 --> 00:08:54.674\nand with a very good reason, because there are\n\n00:08:54.674 --> 00:08:57.231\nmore than 10,000 children who are killed\n\n00:08:57.231 --> 00:09:00.700\nby cars every year in the world.\n\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.308\nWe have had cities for 8,000 years,\n\n00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:07.644\nand children could walk out of home and play.\n\n00:09:07.644 --> 00:09:09.936\nIn fact, only very recently,\n\n00:09:09.936 --> 00:09:11.770\ntowards 1900, there were no cars.\n\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.771\nCars have been here for really\nless than 100 years.\n\n00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:18.545\nThey completely changed cities.\n\n00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:20.493\nIn 1900, for example,\n\n00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:24.379\nnobody was killed by cars in the United States.\n\n00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:26.294\nOnly 20 years later,\n\n00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:29.689\nbetween 1920 and 1930,\n\n00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:32.047\nalmost 200,000 people\n\n00:09:32.047 --> 00:09:34.557\nwere killed by cars in the United States.\n\n00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:38.588\nOnly in 1925, almost 7,000 children\n\n00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:42.540\nwere killed by cars in the United States.\n\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.543\nSo we could make different cities,\n\n00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:49.304\ncities that will give more priority to human beings\n\n00:09:49.304 --> 00:09:51.763\nthan to cars, that will give more public space\n\n00:09:51.763 --> 00:09:53.887\nto human beings than to cars,\n\n00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:56.642\ncities which show great respect\n\n00:09:56.642 --> 00:09:58.803\nfor those most vulnerable citizens,\n\n00:09:58.803 --> 00:10:00.587\nsuch as children or the elderly.\n\n00:10:00.587 --> 00:10:04.392\nI will propose to you a couple of ingredients\n\n00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:07.734\nwhich I think would make cities much better,\n\n00:10:07.734 --> 00:10:10.219\nand it would be very simple to implement them\n\n00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:13.143\nin the new cities which are only being created.\n\n00:10:13.143 --> 00:10:16.196\nHundreds of kilometers of greenways\n\n00:10:16.196 --> 00:10:19.346\ncriss-crossing cities in all directions.\n\n00:10:19.346 --> 00:10:22.090\nChildren will walk out of homes into safe spaces.\n\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.051\nThey could go for dozens of kilometers safely\n\n00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:28.105\nwithout any risk in wonderful greenways,\n\n00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:30.521\nsort of bicycle highways,\n\n00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:33.626\nand I would invite you to imagine the following:\n\n00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:36.864\na city in which every other street would be\n\n00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:41.935\na street only for pedestrians and bicycles.\n\n00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.181\nIn new cities which are going to be built,\n\n00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:46.726\nthis would not be particularly difficult.\n\n00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:50.253\nWhen I was mayor of Bogot\u00e1,\n\n00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:52.783\nin only three years, we were able to create\n\n00:10:52.783 --> 00:10:54.921\n70 kilometers,\n\n00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:57.417\nin one of the most dense cities in the world,\n\n00:10:57.417 --> 00:10:59.784\nof these bicycle highways.\n\n00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:03.174\nAnd this changes the way people live,\n\n00:11:03.174 --> 00:11:05.846\nmove, enjoy the city.\n\n00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:08.467\nIn this picture, you see in one\nof the very poor neighborhoods,\n\n00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:11.537\nwe have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,\n\n00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.898\nand the cars still in the mud.\n\n00:11:13.898 --> 00:11:16.721\nOf course, I would love to pave this street for cars.\n\n00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:18.169\nBut what do we do first?\n\n00:11:18.169 --> 00:11:21.330\nNinety-nine percent of the people\nin those neighborhoods don't have cars.\n\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.803\nBut you see, when a city is only being created,\n\n00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:25.893\nit's very easy to incorporate\n\n00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:28.069\nthis kind of infrastructure.\n\n00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:30.767\nThen the city grows around it.\n\n00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:33.810\nAnd of course this is just a glimpse\n\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.605\nof something which could be much better\n\n00:11:36.605 --> 00:11:38.323\nif we just create it,\n\n00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.660\nand it changes the way of life.\n\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.726\nAnd the second ingredient,\nwhich would solve mobility,\n\n00:11:44.726 --> 00:11:47.304\nthat very difficult challenge in developing countries,\n\n00:11:47.304 --> 00:11:50.299\nin a very low-cost and simple way,\n\n00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:54.311\nwould be to have hundreds of kilometers\n\n00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:56.833\nof streets only for buses,\n\n00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:59.937\nbuses and bicycles and pedestrians.\n\n00:11:59.937 --> 00:12:02.976\nThis would be, again, a very low-cost solution\n\n00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:05.299\nif implemented from the start,\n\n00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:07.822\nlow cost, pleasant transit\n\n00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:11.520\nwith natural sunlight.\n\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.168\nBut unfortunately, reality is not as good\n\n00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.920\nas my dreams.\n\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.102\nBecause of private property of land\n\n00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:24.123\nand high land prices,\n\n00:12:24.123 --> 00:12:27.160\nall developing country cities\nhave a large problem of slums.\n\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.070\nIn my country of Colombia, almost half the homes\n\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.416\nin cities initially were illegal developments.\n\n00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:38.628\nAnd of course it's very difficult to have\n\n00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:42.584\nmass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.\n\n00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:44.630\nBut even legal developments\n\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.602\nhave also been located in the wrong places,\n\n00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:50.403\nvery far from the city centers\n\n00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:52.440\nwhere it's impossible to provide\n\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.271\nlow-cost, high-frequency public transport.\n\n00:12:56.271 --> 00:12:59.151\nAs a Latin American, and Latin America\n\n00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:02.578\nwas the most recently organized region in the world,\n\n00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:07.738\nI would recommend, respectfully, passionately,\n\n00:13:07.738 --> 00:13:11.848\nto those countries which are yet to urbanize --\n\n00:13:11.848 --> 00:13:16.869\nLatin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950\n\n00:13:16.869 --> 00:13:22.942\nto 80 percent urban in 2010 --\n\n00:13:22.942 --> 00:13:26.102\nI would recommend Asian and African countries\n\n00:13:26.102 --> 00:13:27.884\nwhich are yet to urbanize,\n\n00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:32.051\nsuch as India which is only 33 percent urban now,\n\n00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:35.026\nthat governments should acquire\nall land around cities.\n\n00:13:35.026 --> 00:13:37.547\nIn this way, their cities could grow in the right places\n\n00:13:37.547 --> 00:13:39.322\nwith the right spaces, with the parks,\n\n00:13:39.322 --> 00:13:42.698\nwith the greenways, with the busways.\n\n00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:44.213\nThe cities we are going to build\n\n00:13:44.213 --> 00:13:46.053\nover the next 50 years\n\n00:13:46.053 --> 00:13:48.450\nwill determine quality of life and even happiness\n\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.604\nfor billions of people towards the future.\n\n00:13:50.604 --> 00:13:54.182\nWhat a fantastic opportunity for leaders\n\n00:13:54.182 --> 00:13:56.424\nand many young leaders to come,\n\n00:13:56.424 --> 00:13:58.491\nespecially in the developing countries.\n\n00:13:58.491 --> 00:14:00.338\nThey can create a much happier life\n\n00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:01.907\nfor billions towards the future.\n\n00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.870\nI am sure, I am optimistic,\n\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.778\nthat they will make cities better\n\n00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.947\nthan our most ambitious dreams.\n\n00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:12.824\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What I learned from Nelson Mandela", "duration": "899", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/boyd_varty_what_i_learned_from_nelson_mandela", "transcript": "I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart, and so just before I get going, I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom. And so this talk is going to be for him.I grew up in wonder. I grew up amongst those animals. I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve. It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations. Now for as long as I can remember, my job has been to take people out into nature, and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering. Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories, and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories, stories about heroes of heart. Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news, and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place, I also know it to be a place where people, animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world.When I was nine years old, President Mandela came to stay with my family. He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration, and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status. Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye, and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi. (Laughter) But it was a defining time for me as a young boy. I would take him breakfast in bed, and then, in an old track suit and slippers, he would go for a walk around the garden. At night, I would sit with my family around the snowy, bunny-eared TV, and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly. He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa, one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity. Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think, to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa: peace, reconciliation, harmony. Through this act of immense open-heartedness, he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call \"ubuntu.\" Ubuntu: I am because of you. Or, people are not people without other people. It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on. In fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa, we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others. Ubuntu is at play right now. You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am. Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this. (Laughter)If Mandela was the national and international embodiment, then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man, Solly Mhlongo. Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique. He would never have a lot of money, but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet. Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle. Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle, but it makes for \u00fcber-resourcefulness. The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks. Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea, but he could do it. He then moved across into what we called the habitat team. These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being. He fixed roads, he mended wetlands, he did some anti-poaching. And then one day we were out together, and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked. And it was an old track, but for fun he turned and he began to follow it, and I tell you, I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker. If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve, you look up in your rearview mirror, you'd see he'd stopped the car 20, 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something. The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said, \"Solly, you are pathologically helpful.\" (Laughter)When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment, Solly was my tracker. We worked together as a team. And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast, and they said to Solly, on the side, they said, \"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards, we want to see where you live.\" So we took them up to his house, and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife, who was learning English, was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying, \"Hello, I love you. Welcome, I love you.\" (Laughter) And there was something so beautifully African about it to me, this small house with a huge heart in it.Now on the day that Solly saved my life, he was already my hero. It was a hot day, and we found ourselves down by the river. Because of the heat, I took my shoes off, and I rolled up my pants, and I walked into the water. Solly remained on the bank. The water was clear running over sand, and we turned and we began to make our way upstream. And a few meters ahead of us, there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank, and its branches were touching the water, and it was shadowy. And if had been a horror movie, people in the audience would have started saying, \"Don't go in there. Don't go in there.\" (Laughter) And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows. Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite. Wham! It hits me by my right leg. It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch. It's shaking me violently. It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you, and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that. (Laughter) Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. He turns. He begins to make his way to me. The croc again continues to shake me. It goes to bite me a second time. I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream. As it bites the second time, I kick. My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out. I pull myself up into the branches, and as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder. My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description. The bone is cracked. The meat is torn up. I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again. As I come out of the water, Solly arrives at a deep section, a channel between us. He knows, he sees the state of my leg, he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile, and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. He comes straight into the channel. He wades in to above his waist. He gets to me. He grabs me. I'm still in a vulnerable position. He picks me and puts me on his shoulder. This is the other thing about Solly, he's freakishly strong. He turns. He walks me up the bank. He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off. He wraps it around my leg, picks me up a second time, walks me to a vehicle, and he's able to get me to medical attention. And I survive.Now \u2014 (Applause)Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing. And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa. In a more collective society, we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others. Danger is shared. Pain is shared. Joy is shared. Achievement is shared. Houses are shared. Food is shared. Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share, and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value, his animated, empathetic action in every moment.Now although the root word is about people, I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people. And then I met this young lady. Her name was Elvis. In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance. She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis. She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route. When I first saw her, I thought she would be dead in a matter of days. And yet, for the next five years she returned in the winter months. And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. It looked like an inverted bracket, and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow, and then we would come around the corner, and there she would be with her herd. And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship. And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals. And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving. And then one day we came across them at this small water hole. It was sort of a hollow in the ground. And I watched as the matriarch drank, and then she turned in that  beautiful slow motion of elephants, looks like the arm in motion, and she began to make her way up the steep bank. The rest of the herd turned and began to follow. And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. She got visibly \u2014 ears came forward, she had a full go of it and halfway up, her legs gave way, and she fell backwards. She attempted it a second time, and again, halfway up, she fell backwards. And on the third attempt, an amazing thing happened. Halfway up the bank, a young teenage elephant came in behind her, and he propped his trunk underneath her, and he began to shovel her up the bank. And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant. The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth, and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant.What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu, and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet. If Africa has a gift to share, it's a gift of a more collective society. And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea, what I see is the essence of that value being invented here.Thank you.(Applause)Pat Mitchell: So Boyd, we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today, and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world. But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts, because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session.Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat. I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. He was suffering. And so of course there's the mixed emotions. But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. (Laughter) And she was like, \"Well, it'll be about you.\" I mean, that's just incredible humility. (Laughter)He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa. And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic. You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. Anywhere he went, things went well. But I think that magic will be with us, and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for. And so that's what I'm going to try and do, and that's what people all over  South Africa are trying to do.PM: And that's what you've done today. BV: Oh, thank you.PM: Thank you. BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id": 1890, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.247\nI'm a man who's trying to live from his

--> 00:01:29.773\nand so what I have to share with you today\n\n00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:34.192\nis the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,\n\n00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.330\nstories about heroes of heart.\n\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.450\nNow my stories are not the stories\n\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.148\nthat you'll hear on the news,\n\n00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:44.121\nand while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,\n\n00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.058\nI also know it to be a place\n\n00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:50.324\nwhere people, animals and ecosystems\n\n00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:54.711\nteach us about a more interconnected world.\n\n00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:56.689\nWhen I was nine years old,\n\n00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.923\nPresident Mandela came to stay with my family.\n\n00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:03.347\nHe had just been released from\nhis 27 years of incarceration,\n\n00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.974\nand was in a period of readjustment\n\n00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:08.633\nto his sudden global icon status.\n\n00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.133\nMembers of the African National Congress\n\n00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.124\nthought that in the bush\n\n00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:15.358\nhe would have time to rest and recuperate\n\n00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:17.119\naway from the public eye,\n\n00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.498\nand it's true that lions tend to be\n\n00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:24.729\na very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.\n\n00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.858\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:29.404\nBut it was a defining time for me as a young boy.\n\n00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:31.465\nI would take him breakfast in bed,\n\n00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:33.833\nand then, in an old track suit and slippers,\n\n00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:36.438\nhe would go for a walk around the garden.\n\n00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:38.116\nAt night, I would sit with my family\n\n00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.617\naround the snowy, bunny-eared TV,\n\n00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:43.035\nand watch images of that same\n\n00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:44.969\nquiet man from the garden\n\n00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.019\nsurrounded by hundreds and thousands of people\n\n00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.278\nas scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.\n\n00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:53.230\nHe was bringing peace\n\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.112\nto a divided and violent South Africa,\n\n00:02:56.112 --> 00:03:01.341\none man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.\n\n00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:04.105\nMandela said often that the gift of prison\n\n00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:07.065\nwas the ability to go within and to think,\n\n00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:08.794\nto create in himself\n\n00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.673\nthe things he most wanted for South Africa:\n\n00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:15.018\npeace, reconciliation, harmony.\n\n00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:17.873\nThrough this act of immense open-heartedness,\n\n00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:20.105\nhe was to become the embodiment\n\n00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.644\nof what in South Africa we call \"ubuntu.\"\n\n00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:26.493\nUbuntu: I am because of you.\n\n00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:29.156\nOr, people are not people\n\n00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.881\nwithout other people.\n\n00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:33.727\nIt's not a new idea or value\n\n00:03:33.727 --> 00:03:35.582\nbut it's one that I certainly think at these times\n\n00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.331\nis worth building on.\n\n00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.495\nIn fact, it is said that in the\ncollective consciousness of Africa,\n\n00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:42.534\nwe get to experience the deepest parts\n\n00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:43.839\nof our own humanity\n\n00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.623\nthrough our interactions with others.\n\n00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:48.735\nUbuntu is at play right now.\n\n00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:50.735\nYou are holding a space for me\n\n00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:54.127\nto express the deepest truth of who I am.\n\n00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:56.387\nWithout you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,\n\n00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:59.465\nand I spent a lot of time last week doing that,\n\n00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:02.788\nand it's not the same as this.\n\n00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:05.214\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:08.662\nIf Mandela was the national\nand international embodiment,\n\n00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:10.256\nthen the man who taught me the most\n\n00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:12.859\nabout this value personally was this man,\n\n00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.217\nSolly Mhlongo.\n\n00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:16.025\nSolly was born under a tree\n\n00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:18.811\n60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.\n\n00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.311\nHe would never have a lot of money,\n\n00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:21.733\nbut he was to be\n\n00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:24.362\none of the richest men I would ever meet.\n\n00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:27.081\nSolly grew up tending to his father's cattle.\n\n00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:31.263\nNow, I can tell you, I don't know what it is\nabout people who grow up looking after cattle,\n\n00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:34.285\nbut it makes for \u00fcber-resourcefulness.\n\n00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:36.759\nThe first job that he ever got in the safari business\n\n00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.975\nwas fixing the safari trucks.\n\n00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:41.629\nWhere he had learned to do that out in the bush\n\n00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.758\nI have no idea, but he could do it.\n\n00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:45.685\nHe then moved across into what we called\n\n00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.072\nthe habitat team.\n\n00:04:47.072 --> 00:04:48.958\nThese were the people on the reserve\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.315\nwho were responsible for its well-being.\n\n00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:53.599\nHe fixed roads, he mended wetlands,\n\n00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.417\nhe did some anti-poaching.\n\n00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:57.543\nAnd then one day we were out together,\n\n00:04:57.543 --> 00:05:01.074\nand he came across the tracks of where\na female leopard had walked.\n\n00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:02.848\nAnd it was an old track,\n\n00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:05.289\nbut for fun he turned and he began to follow it,\n\n00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.864\nand I tell you, I could tell by the speed\n\n00:05:06.864 --> 00:05:08.561\nat which he moved on those pad marks\n\n00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:12.535\nthat this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.\n\n00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:14.309\nIf you drove past Solly\n\n00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:15.987\nsomewhere out on the reserve,\n\n00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:17.636\nyou look up in your rearview mirror,\n\n00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:19.481\nyou'd see he'd stopped the car\n\n00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.527\n20, 50 meters down the road\n\n00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:24.540\njust in case you need help with something.\n\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.293\nThe only accusation I ever heard leveled at him\n\n00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.688\nwas when one of our clients said,\n\n00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:31.905\n\"Solly, you are pathologically helpful.\"\n\n00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.352\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:37.243\nWhen I started professionally guiding people\n\n00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:38.900\nout into this environment,\n\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.460\nSolly was my tracker.\n\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.279\nWe worked together as a team.\n\n00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.305\nAnd the first guests we ever got\n\n00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:47.152\nwere a philanthropy group from your East Coast,\n\n00:05:47.152 --> 00:05:49.506\nand they said to Solly, on the side, they said,\n\n00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:52.147\n\"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,\n\n00:05:52.147 --> 00:05:54.209\nwe want to see where you live.\"\n\n00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:55.674\nSo we took them up to his house,\n\n00:05:55.674 --> 00:05:58.546\nand this visit of the philanthropist to his house\n\n00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:01.227\ncoincided with a time when Solly's wife,\n\n00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.827\nwho was learning English,\n\n00:06:02.827 --> 00:06:05.011\nwas going through a phase\nwhere she would open the door\n\n00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:07.675\nby saying, \"Hello, I love you.\n\n00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:09.890\nWelcome, I love you.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.439\nAnd there was something so beautifully African\n\n00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:14.284\nabout it to me, this small house\n\n00:06:14.284 --> 00:06:16.869\nwith a huge heart in it.\n\n00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:23.444\nNow on the day that Solly saved my life,\n\n00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:25.455\nhe was already my hero.\n\n00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:27.036\nIt was a hot day,\n\n00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:29.010\nand we found ourselves down by the river.\n\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.846\nBecause of the heat, I took my shoes off,\n\n00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:33.549\nand I rolled up my pants,\n\n00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:35.790\nand I walked into the water.\n\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.352\nSolly remained on the bank.\n\n00:06:37.352 --> 00:06:40.375\nThe water was clear running over sand,\n\n00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:43.689\nand we turned and we began\nto make our way upstream.\n\n00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.509\nAnd a few meters ahead of us,\n\n00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.494\nthere was a place where a tree\nhad fallen out of the bank,\n\n00:06:48.494 --> 00:06:51.265\nand its branches were touching the water,\n\n00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.862\nand it was shadowy.\n\n00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.320\nAnd if had been a horror movie,\n\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.556\npeople in the audience would have started saying,\n\n00:06:57.556 --> 00:07:01.009\n\"Don't go in there. Don't go in there.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.766\nAnd of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.\n\n00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:06.881\nNow the first thing that you notice\nwhen a crocodile hits you\n\n00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.481\nis the ferocity of the bite.\n\n00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:10.454\nWham! It hits me by my right leg.\n\n00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:14.357\nIt pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.\nI'm able to grab a branch.\n\n00:07:14.357 --> 00:07:16.095\nIt's shaking me violently.\n\n00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:17.809\nIt's a very strange sensation\n\n00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.755\nhaving another creature try and eat you,\n\n00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:23.206\nand there are few things that\npromote vegetarianism like that.\n\n00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:24.801\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.086\nSolly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.\n\n00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:29.133\nHe turns. He begins to make his way to me.\n\n00:07:29.133 --> 00:07:31.084\nThe croc again continues to shake me.\n\n00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:33.001\nIt goes to bite me a second time.\n\n00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:35.190\nI notice a slick of blood in the water around me\n\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.794\nthat gets washed downstream.\n\n00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:38.967\nAs it bites the second time, I kick.\n\n00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:41.700\nMy foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.\n\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.831\nI pull myself up into the branches,\n\n00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:47.314\nand as I come out of the water,\nI look over my shoulder.\n\n00:07:47.314 --> 00:07:49.234\nMy leg from the knee down\n\n00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:51.162\nis mangled beyond description.\n\n00:07:51.162 --> 00:07:52.557\nThe bone is cracked.\n\n00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:54.387\nThe meat is torn up.\n\n00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:58.987\nI make an instant decision that\nI'll never look at that again.\n\n00:07:58.987 --> 00:08:01.371\nAs I come out of the water,\n\n00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.988\nSolly arrives at a deep section,\n\n00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:05.613\na channel between us.\n\n00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:07.751\nHe knows, he sees the state of my leg,\n\n00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:09.597\nhe knows that between him and I\n\n00:08:09.597 --> 00:08:10.809\nthere is a crocodile,\n\n00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:13.301\nand I can tell you this man doesn't\nslow down for one second.\n\n00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:15.107\nHe comes straight into the channel.\n\n00:08:15.107 --> 00:08:17.042\nHe wades in to above his waist.\n\n00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:18.505\nHe gets to me. He grabs me.\n\n00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:20.177\nI'm still in a vulnerable position.\n\n00:08:20.177 --> 00:08:21.902\nHe picks me and puts me on his shoulder.\n\n00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:24.321\nThis is the other thing about Solly,\nhe's freakishly strong.\n\n00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:26.784\nHe turns. He walks me up the bank.\n\n00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:28.838\nHe lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.\n\n00:08:28.838 --> 00:08:30.622\nHe wraps it around my leg,\n\n00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:31.913\npicks me up a second time,\n\n00:08:31.913 --> 00:08:33.819\nwalks me to a vehicle,\n\n00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:37.243\nand he's able to get me to medical attention.\n\n00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:40.466\nAnd I survive.\n\n00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:44.727\nNow \u2014 (Applause)\n\n00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:47.437\nNow I don't know how many people you know\n\n00:08:47.437 --> 00:08:49.653\nthat go into a deep channel of water\n\n00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:51.913\nthat they know has a crocodile in it\n\n00:08:51.913 --> 00:08:53.256\nto come and help you,\n\n00:08:53.256 --> 00:08:56.700\nbut for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.\n\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.156\nAnd he is one amazing example\n\n00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:02.601\nof what I have experienced all over Africa.\n\n00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:04.732\nIn a more collective society,\n\n00:09:04.732 --> 00:09:07.580\nwe realize from the inside\n\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.713\nthat our own well-being is deeply tied\n\n00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:13.951\nto the well-being of others.\n\n00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.220\nDanger is shared. Pain is shared.\n\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.145\nJoy is shared. Achievement is shared.\n\n00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:24.675\nHouses are shared. Food is shared.\n\n00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:27.871\nUbuntu asks us to open our hearts\n\n00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:29.285\nand to share,\n\n00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:31.237\nand what Solly taught me that day\n\n00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.240\nis the essence of this value,\n\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.998\nhis animated, empathetic action\n\n00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:38.043\nin every moment.\n\n00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:41.550\nNow although the root word is about people,\n\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.924\nI thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.\n\n00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:48.198\nAnd then I met this young lady.\n\n00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:49.892\nHer name was Elvis.\n\n00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:51.663\nIn fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis\n\n00:09:51.663 --> 00:09:54.520\nbecause he said she walked like she was doing\n\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.185\nthe Elvis the pelvis dance.\n\n00:09:57.185 --> 00:10:01.551\nShe was born with very badly\ndeformed back legs and pelvis.\n\n00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:03.815\nShe arrived at our reserve from a reserve\n\n00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:05.871\neast of us on her migratory route.\n\n00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.650\nWhen I first saw her,\n\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.118\nI thought she would be dead in a matter of days.\n\n00:10:10.118 --> 00:10:13.046\nAnd yet, for the next five years\n\n00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:15.576\nshe returned in the winter months.\n\n00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.953\nAnd we would be so excited to be out in the bush\n\n00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:20.349\nand to come across this unusual track.\n\n00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:21.844\nIt looked like an inverted bracket,\n\n00:10:21.844 --> 00:10:24.293\nand we would drop whatever\nwe were doing and we would follow,\n\n00:10:24.293 --> 00:10:25.964\nand then we would come around the corner,\n\n00:10:25.964 --> 00:10:28.050\nand there she would be with her herd.\n\n00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.945\nAnd that outpouring of emotion\n\n00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:32.659\nfrom people on our safari trucks\n\n00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:35.901\nas they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.\n\n00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.386\nAnd it reminded me\n\n00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.317\nthat even people who grow up in cities\n\n00:10:39.317 --> 00:10:42.902\nfeel a natural connection\n\n00:10:42.902 --> 00:10:45.173\nwith the natural world and with animals.\n\n00:10:45.173 --> 00:10:48.757\nAnd yet still I remained amazed\nthat she was surviving.\n\n00:10:48.757 --> 00:10:51.718\nAnd then one day we came across\nthem at this small water hole.\n\n00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:53.570\nIt was sort of a hollow in the ground.\n\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.024\nAnd I watched as the matriarch drank,\n\n00:10:56.024 --> 00:10:59.298\nand then she turned in that \nbeautiful slow motion of elephants,\n\n00:10:59.299 --> 00:11:01.068\nlooks like the arm in motion,\n\n00:11:01.068 --> 00:11:04.074\nand she began to make her way up the steep bank.\n\n00:11:04.074 --> 00:11:08.718\nThe rest of the herd turned and began to follow.\n\n00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:10.502\nAnd I watched young Elvis\n\n00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:13.858\nbegin to psych herself up for the hill.\n\n00:11:13.858 --> 00:11:17.213\nShe got visibly -- ears came forward,\n\n00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:19.362\nshe had a full go of it and halfway up,\n\n00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:21.639\nher legs gave way, and she fell backwards.\n\n00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.458\nShe attempted it a second time,\n\n00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:26.633\nand again, halfway up, she fell backwards.\n\n00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:28.490\nAnd on the third attempt,\n\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.947\nan amazing thing happened.\n\n00:11:30.947 --> 00:11:32.684\nHalfway up the bank,\n\n00:11:32.684 --> 00:11:35.757\na young teenage elephant came in behind her,\n\n00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:37.960\nand he propped his trunk underneath her,\n\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.297\nand he began to shovel her up the bank.\n\n00:11:41.297 --> 00:11:42.685\nAnd it occurred to me\n\n00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:44.241\nthat the rest of the herd\n\n00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.916\nwas in fact looking after this young elephant.\n\n00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:49.440\nThe next day I watched again\n\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.610\nas the matriarch broke a branch\n\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.451\nand she would put it in her mouth,\n\n00:11:53.451 --> 00:11:55.408\nand then she would break a second one\n\n00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:58.115\nand drop it on the ground.\n\n00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:00.487\nAnd a consensus developed between all of us\n\n00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:02.336\nwho were guiding people in that area\n\n00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:05.485\nthat that herd was in fact moving slower\n\n00:12:05.485 --> 00:12:09.541\nto accommodate that elephant.\n\n00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:11.632\nWhat Elvis and the herd taught me\n\n00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:14.956\ncaused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,\n\n00:12:14.956 --> 00:12:17.572\nand I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,\n\n00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:19.783\nwe get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves\n\n00:12:19.783 --> 00:12:21.540\nreflected back at us.\n\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.180\nAnd it is not only through other people\n\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.100\nthat we get to experience our humanity\n\n00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.026\nbut through all the creatures that live on this planet.\n\n00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:34.840\nIf Africa has a gift to share,\n\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.667\nit's a gift of a more collective society.\n\n00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:42.915\nAnd while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,\n\n00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:47.326\nwhat I see is the essence of that value\n\n00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:49.688\nbeing invented here.\n\n00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:51.803\nThank you.\n\n00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:56.656\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.837\nPat Mitchell: So Boyd,\n\n00:13:17.837 --> 00:13:22.878\nwe know that you knew President Mandela\n\n00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:24.855\nfrom early childhood\n\n00:13:24.855 --> 00:13:27.754\nand that you heard the news as we all did today,\n\n00:13:27.754 --> 00:13:30.194\nand deeply distraught\n\n00:13:30.194 --> 00:13:34.625\nand know the tragic loss that it is to the world.\n\n00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:36.707\nBut I just wondered if you wanted\n\n00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:38.598\nto share any additional thoughts,\n\n00:13:38.613 --> 00:13:40.687\nbecause we know that you heard that news\n\n00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:44.067\njust before coming in to do this session.\n\n00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:45.763\nBoyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.\n\n00:13:45.763 --> 00:13:48.946\nI'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.\n\n00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:50.717\nHe was suffering.\n\n00:13:50.717 --> 00:13:53.115\nAnd so of course there's the mixed emotions.\n\n00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:55.099\nBut I just think of so many occurrences\n\n00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:57.506\nlike the time he went on the Oprah show\n\n00:13:57.506 --> 00:14:00.362\nand asked her what the show would be about.\n\n00:14:00.362 --> 00:14:01.840\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.138\nAnd she was like, \"Well, it'll be about you.\"\n\n00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:07.886\nI mean, that's just incredible humility.\n\n00:14:07.886 --> 00:14:11.549\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:14.711\nHe was the father of our nation\n\n00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:21.159\nand we've got a road to walk in South Africa.\n\n00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:24.569\nAnd everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.\n\n00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:27.352\nYou know, he used to go to\na rugby match and we would win.\n\n00:14:27.352 --> 00:14:30.813\nAnywhere he went, things went well.\n\n00:14:30.813 --> 00:14:33.194\nBut I think that magic will be with us,\n\n00:14:33.194 --> 00:14:36.755\nand the important thing is that we carry\n\n00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:38.280\nwhat he stood for.\n\n00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.767\nAnd so that's what I'm going to try and do,\n\n00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:44.659\nand that's what people all over \nSouth Africa are trying to do.\n\n00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:46.885\nPM: And that's what you've done today.\nBV: Oh, thank you.\n\n00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:50.024\nPM: Thank you.\nBV: Thank you. Thanks very much.\n\n00:14:50.024 --> 00:14:54.246\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to build with clay ... and community", "duration": "731", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/diebedo_francis_kere_how_to_build_with_clay_and_community", "transcript": "I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope.I am a native of Burkina Faso. According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world, but what does it look like to grow up in a place like that? I am an example of that. I was born in a little village called Gando. In Gando, there was no electricity, no access to clean drinking water, and no school. But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write. For this reason, I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family. In this place I sat in a class like that with more than 150 other kids, and for six years. In this time, it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died.Today, not so much has changed. There is still no electricity in my village. People still are dying in Burkina Faso, and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem.I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. But I was lucky. I had a scholarship. I could go to Germany to study.So now, I suppose, I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. From Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso, to Berlin in Germany to become an architect is a big, big step. But what to do with this privilege? Since I was a student, I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando. I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money? Oh yes, I started to make drawings and asked for money. Fundraising was not an easy task. I even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes, but to sponsor my school project. In real wonder, two years later, I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars.When I came home to Gando to bring the good news, my people were over the moon, but when they realized that I was planning to use clay, they were shocked.\"A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season, and Francis wants us to use it and build a school. Is this the reason why he spent so much time in Europe studying instead of working in the field with us?\"My people build all the time with clay, but they don't see any innovation with mud. So I had to convince everybody. I started to speak with the community, and I could convince everybody, and we could start to work. And the women, the men, everybody from the village, was part of this building process. I was allowed to use even traditional techniques. So clay floor for example, the young men come and stand like that, beating, hours for hours, and then their mothers came, and they are beating in this position, for hours, giving water and beating. And then the polishers come. They start polishing it with a stone for hours. And then you have this result, very fine, like a baby bottom. (Laughter) It's not photoshopped. (Laughter) This is the school, built with the community. The walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from Gando. The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete. And the classroom, the ceiling is made out of both of them used together.In this school, there was a simple idea: to create comfort in a classroom. Don't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso, so with simple ventilation, I wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning. And this is the project today, 12 years old, still in best condition. And the kids, they love it.And for me and my community, this project was a huge success. It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando. So I could do a lot of projects, and here I am going to share with you only three of them.The first one is the school extension, of course. How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write? I started to build a prototype like that. The innovation was to build a clay vault. So then, I jumped on the top like that, with my team, and it works. The community is looking. It still works. So we can build. (Laughter) And we kept building, and that is the result. The kids are happy, and they love it. The community is very proud. We made it. And even animals, like these donkeys, love our buildings. (Laughter)The next project is the library in Gando. And see now, we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings, but we often don't have so much material. Something we have in Gando are clay pots. We wanted to use them to create openings. So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. we start cutting them, and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete, and you have this result. The openings are letting the hot air out and light in. Very simple.My most recent project in Gando is a high school project. I would like to share with you this. The innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete. How do you cast mud? We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see, and when everything is ready, when you know what is the best recipe and the best form, you start working with the community. And sometimes I can leave. They will do it themselves. I came to speak to you like that.Another factor in Gando is rain. When the rains come, we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain. Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude. It is simply how we protect our walls. (Laughter) The rain in Burkina comes very fast, and after that, you have floods everywhere in the country. But for us, the rain is good. It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build. We just wait for the rain to go. We take the sand, we mix it with clay, and we keep building. That is it.The Gando project was always connected to training the people, because I just wanted, one day when I fall down and die, that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. But you will be surprised. I'm still alive. (Laughter)And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. Usually, for a young man from Gando to earn money, you have to leave the country to the city, sometimes leave the country and some never come back, making the community weaker. But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. There's a new quality in this work.Yes, you know it. I have won a lot of awards through this work. For sure, it has opened opportunities. I have become myself known. But the reason why I do what I do is my community.When I was a kid, I was going to school, I was coming back every holiday to Gando. By the end of every holidays, I had to say goodbye to the community, going from one compound to another one. All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny. In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection. As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed. I just asked my mother one day, \"Why do all these women love me so much?\" (Laughter) She just answered, \"They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community.\" I hope now that I was able to make my community proud through this work, and I hope I was able to prove you the power of community, and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future.Merci beaucoup.

Okay, a few of you. When you think of a cave, most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock, and in fact, that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country, most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from, most of our  caves are made of lava rock, because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share  with you today are made completely of ice, specifically glacier ice that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.Now Mount Hood's only  one hour's drive from Portland, the largest city in Oregon, where over two million people live. Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now these days, with so many people hiking around, it's pretty hard to find a new cave, so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut, because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before.So what is a glacier? Well, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light, because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball, it gets really small, hard and dense. Well, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows over 20 feet a year, it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice. Now each year, more and more ice stacks up on top of it, and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight, forming a slow-moving river of ice. When ice packed like that starts to move, we call it a glacier, and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier. Now each year, as new snow lands on the glacier, it melts in the summer sun, and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice, and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier, forming big networks of caves, sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock. Now the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year, new tunnels form. Different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down, and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up, gets into the cave, and melts the ceilings back taller and taller. But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving, because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain.Now this is Brent McGregor, my cave exploration partner. He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time, but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before. Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves. There were no GPS coordinates for it, and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier. So in July of that year, we went out on the glacier, and we found a big crack in the ice. We had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole. This is me looking into the entrance crevasse. At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice. We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end, and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out.So how do you map a cave? Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes  going to overlapping levels. To make a cave map, you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave, and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations. Then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings. Now those of you taking trigonometry, that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there. In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves, the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be. So when you're done surveying, you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this, and it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage, kind of like an ant farm view. We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow. Now later this summer, as more snow melted off the glacier, we found more caves, and we realized they were all connected.Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon, Brent discovered this new cave not very far away. The inside of it was coated with ice, so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping. This cave was amazing. The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up. And we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end and we found out why. There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier. Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave, freezing everything inside of it. And we were so excited about finding this new pit, we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it. It was so cold outside, we actually had to sleep inside the cave. There's our camp on the left side  of this entrance room. The next morning, we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier, where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination, I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined.So besides really cool ice, what else is inside these caves? Well not too much lives in them  because they're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year. But there are some really cool things in there. There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice. In fact, this past summer, scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles, tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions, might be living under the ice, kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday. Another really cool things is that, as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die, they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier, sinking deeper and deeper into the ice. As these caves form and melt  their way up into the ice, they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor, where we end up finding them. For example, this is a noble fir seed we found. It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years, and it's just now starting to sprout. This mallard duck feather was found over 1,800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave. This duck died on the surface of the glacier long, long ago, and its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice before falling inside the cave. And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon.Even now, Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were  essentially in our own backyard, hidden away, just waiting to be found. Like I said earlier, the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something  you can only do with space travel now, but that's not true. Every year, new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. So it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it, because it might be in your own backyard.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1889, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:15.534\nSo how many of you have ever\nbeen in a cave

a name.\n\n00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:57.112\nThe name of the glacier these caves are formed in\n\n00:01:57.112 --> 00:01:58.788\nis the Sandy Glacier.\n\n00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:02.241\nNow each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,\n\n00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:03.908\nit melts in the summer sun,\n\n00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:06.767\nand it forms little rivers of water\non the flow along the ice,\n\n00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.644\nand they start to melt and bore\ntheir way down through the glacier,\n\n00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:11.572\nforming big networks of caves,\n\n00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:14.877\nsometimes going all the way down\nto the underlying bedrock.\n\n00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:16.949\nNow the crazy thing about glacier caves\n\n00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.056\nis that each year, new tunnels form.\n\n00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.049\nDifferent waterfalls pop up or move around\n\n00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.181\nfrom place to place inside the cave.\n\n00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.026\nWarm water from the top of the ice\n\n00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:27.503\nis boring its way down,\n\n00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.443\nand warm air from below the mountain\n\n00:02:29.443 --> 00:02:31.884\nactually rises up, gets into the cave,\n\n00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:34.427\nand melts the ceilings back taller and taller.\n\n00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:36.554\nBut the weirdest thing about glacier caves\n\n00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:38.660\nis that the entire cave is moving,\n\n00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.540\nbecause it's formed inside a block of ice\n\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.231\nthe size of a small city\n\n00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.628\nthat's slowly sliding down the mountain.\n\n00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:46.455\nNow this is Brent McGregor,\n\n00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:48.427\nmy cave exploration partner.\n\n00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:51.042\nHe and I have both been exploring caves a long time\n\n00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.010\nand we've been climbing mountains a long time,\n\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.090\nbut neither one of us had ever really\nexplored a glacier cave before.\n\n00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.135\nBack in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video\n\n00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:02.762\nof a couple of hikers that stumbled across\nthe entrance to one of these caves.\n\n00:03:02.762 --> 00:03:04.782\nThere were no GPS coordinates for it,\n\n00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:06.325\nand all we knew was that it was somewhere\n\n00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:08.005\nout on the Sandy Glacier.\n\n00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:10.604\nSo in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,\n\n00:03:10.604 --> 00:03:12.582\nand we found a big crack in the ice.\n\n00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:14.783\nWe had to build snow and ice anchors\n\n00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:17.975\nso that we could tie off ropes\nand rappel down into the hole.\n\n00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:20.711\nThis is me looking into the entrance crevasse.\n\n00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.262\nAt the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel\n\n00:03:23.262 --> 00:03:24.753\ngoing right up the mountain\n\n00:03:24.753 --> 00:03:27.286\nunderneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.\n\n00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:29.690\nWe followed this cave back for about a half mile\n\n00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.329\nuntil it came to an end,\n\n00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.455\nand then with the help of our survey tools\n\n00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:35.523\nwe made a three-dimensional map of the cave\n\n00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:37.046\non our way back out.\n\n00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:39.104\nSo how do you map a cave?\n\n00:03:39.104 --> 00:03:41.832\nWell, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps\n\n00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:45.056\nbecause they have pits and holes \ngoing to overlapping levels.\n\n00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:46.660\nTo make a cave map, you have to set up\n\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.555\nsurvey stations every few feet inside the cave,\n\n00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:52.846\nand you use a laser to measure\nthe distance between those stations.\n\n00:03:52.846 --> 00:03:55.285\nThen you use a compass and an inclinometer\n\n00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:57.221\nto measure the direction the cave is headed\n\n00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.937\nand measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.\n\n00:03:59.937 --> 00:04:01.667\nNow those of you taking trigonometry,\n\n00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:03.778\nthat particular type of math is very useful\n\n00:04:03.778 --> 00:04:05.311\nfor making maps like this\n\n00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.556\nbecause it allows you to measure\nheights and distances\n\n00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:09.461\nwithout actually having to go there.\n\n00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:11.840\nIn fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,\n\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.871\nthe more useful I found all that math\n\n00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:16.113\nthat I originally hated in school to be.\n\n00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.986\nSo when you're done surveying,\n\n00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:20.413\nyou take all this data and\nyou punch it into a computer\n\n00:04:20.413 --> 00:04:23.033\nand you find someone that can draw really well,\n\n00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.681\nand you have them draft up a map\n\n00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.234\nthat looks something like this,\n\n00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:29.502\nand it'll show you both a\nbird's-eye view of the passage\n\n00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.952\nas well as a profile view of the passage,\n\n00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:33.672\nkind of like an ant farm view.\n\n00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:35.671\nWe named this cave Snow Dragon Cave\n\n00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.719\nbecause it was like a big dragon\nsleeping under the snow.\n\n00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.231\nNow later this summer, as more\nsnow melted off the glacier,\n\n00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.898\nwe found more caves, and we realized\nthey were all connected.\n\n00:04:44.898 --> 00:04:47.057\nNot long after we mapped Snow Dragon,\n\n00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:50.077\nBrent discovered this new cave not very far away.\n\n00:04:50.077 --> 00:04:52.216\nThe inside of it was coated with ice,\n\n00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:55.143\nso we had to wear big spikes\non our feet called crampons\n\n00:04:55.143 --> 00:04:57.447\nso we could walk around without slipping.\n\n00:04:57.447 --> 00:04:59.308\nThis cave was amazing.\n\n00:04:59.308 --> 00:05:01.564\nThe ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green\n\n00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:03.302\nbecause the sunlight from far above\n\n00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:06.277\nwas shining through the ice and lighting it all up.\n\n00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:08.185\nAnd we couldn't understand why this cave\n\n00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:09.831\nwas so much colder than Snow Dragon\n\n00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:12.740\nuntil we got to the end and we found out why.\n\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.658\nThere was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin\n\n00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:19.293\ngoing 130 feet straight up\nto the surface of the glacier.\n\n00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:21.104\nCold air from the top of the mountain\n\n00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:23.918\nwas flowing down this hole\nand blasting through the cave,\n\n00:05:23.918 --> 00:05:26.001\nfreezing everything inside of it.\n\n00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:28.212\nAnd we were so excited about finding this new pit,\n\n00:05:28.212 --> 00:05:30.520\nwe actually came back in January the following year\n\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.315\nso we could be the first ones to explore it.\n\n00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:34.740\nIt was so cold outside,\n\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.998\nwe actually had to sleep inside the cave.\n\n00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:40.726\nThere's our camp on the left side \nof this entrance room.\n\n00:05:40.726 --> 00:05:43.335\nThe next morning, we climbed out of the cave\n\n00:05:43.335 --> 00:05:45.344\nand hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,\n\n00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:47.572\nwhere we finally rigged and rappelled this pit\n\n00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:49.339\nfor the very first time.\n\n00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.426\nBrent named this cave Pure Imagination,\n\n00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:53.443\nI think because the beautiful sights we saw in there\n\n00:05:53.443 --> 00:05:56.025\nwere beyond what we could have ever imagined.\n\n00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:59.188\nSo besides really cool ice,\nwhat else is inside these caves?\n\n00:05:59.188 --> 00:06:01.774\nWell not too much lives in them \nbecause they're so cold\n\n00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:03.784\nand the entrance is actually covered up with snow\n\n00:06:03.784 --> 00:06:05.493\nfor about eight months of the year.\n\n00:06:05.493 --> 00:06:07.429\nBut there are some really cool things in there.\n\n00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:09.792\nThere's weird bacteria living in the water\n\n00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:12.056\nthat actually eat and digest rocks\n\n00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:13.410\nto make their own food\n\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.126\nto live under this ice.\n\n00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:17.228\nIn fact, this past summer, scientists collected\n\n00:06:17.228 --> 00:06:19.058\nsamples of water and ice\n\n00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:21.993\nspecifically to see if things called extremophiles,\n\n00:06:21.993 --> 00:06:25.832\ntiny lifeforms that are evolved\nto live in completely hostile conditions,\n\n00:06:25.832 --> 00:06:27.268\nmight be living under the ice,\n\n00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:30.947\nkind of like what they hope to find\non the polar icecaps of Mars someday.\n\n00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:32.408\nAnother really cool things is that,\n\n00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:35.664\nas seeds and birds land on\nthe surface of the glacier and die,\n\n00:06:35.664 --> 00:06:37.308\nthey get buried in the snow\n\n00:06:37.308 --> 00:06:39.098\nand gradually become part of the glacier,\n\n00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:41.472\nsinking deeper and deeper into the ice.\n\n00:06:41.472 --> 00:06:44.715\nAs these caves form and melt \ntheir way up into the ice,\n\n00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:47.164\nthey make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling\n\n00:06:47.164 --> 00:06:49.893\nand fall onto the cave floor,\nwhere we end up finding them.\n\n00:06:49.893 --> 00:06:52.919\nFor example, this is a noble fir seed we found.\n\n00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.144\nIt's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,\n\n00:06:55.144 --> 00:06:57.853\nand it's just now starting to sprout.\n\n00:06:57.853 --> 00:06:59.548\nThis mallard duck feather\n\n00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:02.869\nwas found over 1,800 feet\nin the back of Snow Dragon Cave.\n\n00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:05.827\nThis duck died on the surface\nof the glacier long, long ago,\n\n00:07:05.827 --> 00:07:09.282\nand its feathers have finally made it\ndown through over 100 feet of ice\n\n00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.466\nbefore falling inside the cave.\n\n00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:12.998\nAnd this beautiful quartz crystal\n\n00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:15.123\nwas also found in the back of Snow Dragon.\n\n00:07:15.123 --> 00:07:17.395\nEven now, Brent and I find it hard to believe\n\n00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.726\nthat all these discoveries were \nessentially in our own backyard,\n\n00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.439\nhidden away, just waiting to be found.\n\n00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.712\nLike I said earlier, the idea of discovering\n\n00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:27.119\nin this busy world we live in\n\n00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:30.019\nkind of seems like something \nyou can only do with space travel now,\n\n00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:31.517\nbut that's not true.\n\n00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.795\nEvery year, new caves get discovered\n\n00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:35.560\nthat no one has ever been in before.\n\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.807\nSo it's actually not too late for one of you\n\n00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:39.668\nto become a discoverer yourself.\n\n00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.529\nYou just have to be willing to look\n\n00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:44.165\nand go where people don't often go\n\n00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:46.143\nand focus your eyes and your mind\n\n00:07:46.143 --> 00:07:48.360\nto recognize the discovery when you see it,\n\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.691\nbecause it might be in your own backyard.\n\n00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:52.545\nThank you very much.\n\n00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:56.669\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death", "duration": "933", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_cave_the_4_stories_we_tell_ourselves_about_death", "transcript": "I have a question: Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die?I do. I was a young boy, and my grandfather had just died, and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened. What did it mean that he was dead? Where had he gone? It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him. But then the really shocking question occurred to me: If he could die, could it happen to me too? Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me? Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept? Well, at some point, all children become aware of death. It can happen in different ways, of course, and usually comes in stages. Our idea of death develops as we grow older. And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory, you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too, that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting.And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species. Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal, so at some point in the evolution of our species, some early human's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize, \"I'm going to die.\" This is, if you like, our curse. It's the price we pay for being so damn clever. We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will, the end of all our projects, our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world. We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse.And that's frightening. It's terrifying. And so we look for a way out. And in my case, as I was about five years old, this meant asking my mum. Now when I first started asking what happens when we die, the grown-ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half-hearted Christianity, and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now \"up there looking down on us,\" and if I should die too, which wouldn't happen of course, then I too would go up there, which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator. Now this didn't sound very plausible. I used to watch a children's news program at the time, and this was the era of space exploration. There were always rockets going up into the sky, up into space, going up there. But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people. But I was scared, and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept. And so I believed it anyway, even though it didn't make much sense.And this thought process that I went through as a child, and have been through many times since, including as a grown-up, is a product of what psychologists call a bias. Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong, ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge, distort reality, or see what we want to see, and the bias I'm talking about works like this: Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can, instead, live forever, even if it means taking the existential elevator. Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all. It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies. Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple. They work like this. You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects, and you remind one group that they're going to die but not the other, then you compare their behavior. So you're observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality. And every time, you get the same result: People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever. So here's an example: One recent study took two groups of agnostics, that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs. Now, one group was asked to think about being dead. The other group was asked to think about being lonely. They were then asked again about their religious beliefs. Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus. Twice as likely. Even though the before they were all equally agnostic. But put the fear of death in them, and they run to Jesus.Now, this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence, and it works not just for religion, but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form, whether it's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism, which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole. This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history.Now, the theory behind this bias in the over 400 studies is called terror management theory, and the idea is simple. It's just this. We develop our worldviews, that is, the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it, in order to help us manage the terror of death. And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations, but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take. And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history, just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day. Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story, and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they're retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day.Now, the first story is the simplest. We want to avoid death, and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story, and it might at first sound implausible, but actually, almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever. Ancient Egypt had such myths, ancient Babylon, ancient India. Throughout European history, we find them in the work of the alchemists, and of course we still believe this today, only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science. So 100 years ago, hormones had just been discovered, and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease, and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology. But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir, a story that is as old as civilization. But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy. When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past, the one thing they now have in common is that they're all dead.So we need a backup plan, and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers, and that's resurrection. And it stays with the idea that I am this body, I am this physical organism. It accepts that I'm going to have to die but says, despite that, I can rise up and I can live again. In other words, I can do what Jesus did. Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb], and then he rose up and lived again. And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe, not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims. But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age, for example, with the idea of cryonics. That's the idea that when you die, you can have yourself frozen, and then, at some point when technology has advanced enough, you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected. And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again, and other people believe an  omnipotent scientist will do it.But for others, the whole idea of resurrection, of climbing out of the grave, it's just too much like a bad zombie movie. They find the body too messy, too unreliable to guarantee eternal life, and so they set their hopes on the third, more spiritual immortality story, the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul. Now, the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul, and the idea is central to many religions. But even though, in its current form, in its traditional form, the idea of the soul is still hugely popular, nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age, for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind, your essence, the real you, onto a computer, and so live on as an avatar in the ether.But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science, particularly neuroscience, it suggests that your mind, your essence, the real you, is very much dependent on a particular part of your body, that is, your brain. And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story, and that is legacy, the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world, like the great Greek warrior Achilles, who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame. And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was, and in our digital age, it's even easier to achieve. You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero. All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat. (Laughter) But some people prefer to leave a more tangible, biological legacy \u2014 children, for example. Or they like, they hope, to live on as part of some greater whole, a nation or a family or a tribe, their gene pool. But again, there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality. Woody Allen, for example, who said, \"I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen. I want to live on in my apartment.\"So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories, and I've tried to give just some sense of how they're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day. And the fact that they recur in this way, in such a similar form but in such different belief systems, suggests, I think, that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories. The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence. Rather, we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them, and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death.So the question is, are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial, or can we overcome this bias? Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could. He argued that the fear of death is natural, but it is not rational. \"Death,\" he said, \"is nothing to us, because when we are here, death is not, and when death is here, we are gone.\" Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult to really grasp, to really internalize, because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine. So 2,000 years later, another philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this: \"Death is not an event in life: We do not live to experience death. And so,\" he added, \"in this sense, life has no end.\"So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void, but it wasn't rational, because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience.Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us, yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational, and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us, then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives.Now, I find it helps to see life as being like a book: Just as a book is bounded by its covers, by beginning and end, so our lives are bounded by birth and death, and even though a book is limited by beginning and end, it can encompass distant landscapes, exotic figures, fantastic adventures. And even though a book is limited by beginning and end, the characters within it know no horizons. They only know the moments that make up their story, even when the book is closed. And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page. Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of \"Treasure Island.\" And so it should be with us. Imagine the book of your life, its covers, its beginning and end, and your birth and your death. You can only know the moments in between, the moments that make up your life. It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers, whether before your birth or after your death. And you needn't worry how long the book is, or whether it's a comic strip or an epic. The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1891, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:14.229\nI have a question:\n\n00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.606\nWho here remembers when they first realized\n\n00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:21.029\nthey were going to die?\n\n00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.531\nI do. I was a young boy,\n\n00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:26.586\nand my grandfather had just died,\n\n00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:30.504\nand I remember a few days later lying in bed at night\n\n00:00:30.504 --> 00:00:34.138\ntrying to make sense of what had happened.\n\n00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.773\nWhat did it mean that he was dead?\n\n00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:38.557\nWhere had he gone?\n\n00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:41.979\nIt was like a hole in reality had opened up\n\n00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.114\nand swallowed him.\n\n00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:46.916\nBut then the really shocking\nquestion occurred to me:\n\n00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:50.406\nIf he could die, could it happen to me too?\n\n00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:53.705\nCould that hole in reality open up and swallow me?\n\n00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.495\nWould it open up beneath my bed\n\n00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:58.729\nand swallow me as I slept?\n\n00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.917\nWell, at some point, all children\nbecome aware of death.\n\n00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:04.822\nIt can happen in different ways, of course,\n\n00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:06.655\nand usually comes in stages.\n\n00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:10.168\nOur idea of death develops as we grow older.\n\n00:01:10.168 --> 00:01:12.897\nAnd if you reach back into the dark corners\n\n00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:14.594\nof your memory,\n\n00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:17.597\nyou might remember something like what I felt\n\n00:01:17.597 --> 00:01:20.852\nwhen my grandfather died and when I realized\n\n00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:22.802\nit could happen to me too,\n\n00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:25.381\nthat sense that behind all of this\n\n00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.718\nthe void is waiting.\n\n00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:30.995\nAnd this development in childhood\n\n00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.816\nreflects the development of our species.\n\n00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:37.131\nJust as there was a point in your development\n\n00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:40.657\nas a child when your sense of self and of time\n\n00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:42.756\nbecame sophisticated enough\n\n00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:46.678\nfor you to realize you were mortal,\n\n00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:50.384\nso at some point in the evolution of our species,\n\n00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:53.399\nsome early human's sense of self and of time\n\n00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.642\nbecame sophisticated enough\n\n00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:58.757\nfor them to become the first human to realize,\n\n00:01:58.757 --> 00:02:02.190\n\"I'm going to die.\"\n\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.409\nThis is, if you like, our curse.\n\n00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.452\nIt's the price we pay for being so damn clever.\n\n00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:10.551\nWe have to live in the knowledge\n\n00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:13.212\nthat the worst thing that can possibly happen\n\n00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:14.836\none day surely will,\n\n00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.342\nthe end of all our projects,\n\n00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:19.806\nour hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.\n\n00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.987\nWe each live in the shadow of a personal\n\n00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:24.976\napocalypse.\n\n00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:27.480\nAnd that's frightening. It's terrifying.\n\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.940\nAnd so we look for a way out.\n\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.221\nAnd in my case, as I was about five years old,\n\n00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:36.216\nthis meant asking my mum.\n\n00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:38.678\nNow when I first started asking\n\n00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:40.459\nwhat happens when we die,\n\n00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.551\nthe grown-ups around me at the time\n\n00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:45.754\nanswered with a typical English mix of awkwardness\n\n00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:48.741\nand half-hearted Christianity,\n\n00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.685\nand the phrase I heard most often\n\n00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:52.244\nwas that granddad was now\n\n00:02:52.244 --> 00:02:54.708\n\"up there looking down on us,\"\n\n00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.673\nand if I should die too, which\nwouldn't happen of course,\n\n00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:00.469\nthen I too would go up there,\n\n00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.519\nwhich made death sound a lot like\n\n00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.173\nan existential elevator.\n\n00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:08.291\nNow this didn't sound very plausible.\n\n00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.194\nI used to watch a children's\nnews program at the time,\n\n00:03:11.194 --> 00:03:13.634\nand this was the era of space exploration.\n\n00:03:13.634 --> 00:03:15.808\nThere were always rockets going up into the sky,\n\n00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:18.504\nup into space, going up there.\n\n00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:20.833\nBut none of the astronauts when they came back\n\n00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:24.065\never mentioned having met my granddad\n\n00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:26.524\nor any other dead people.\n\n00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:27.827\nBut I was scared,\n\n00:03:27.827 --> 00:03:30.267\nand the idea of taking the existential elevator\n\n00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:31.873\nto see my granddad\n\n00:03:31.873 --> 00:03:33.288\nsounded a lot better than being swallowed\n\n00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:36.359\nby the void while I slept.\n\n00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.628\nAnd so I believed it anyway,\n\n00:03:38.628 --> 00:03:41.299\neven though it didn't make much sense.\n\n00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.541\nAnd this thought process that I went through\n\n00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.072\nas a child, and have been through many times since,\n\n00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:47.982\nincluding as a grown-up,\n\n00:03:47.982 --> 00:03:50.429\nis a product of what psychologists call\n\n00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.893\na bias.\n\n00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:55.167\nNow a bias is a way in which we systematically\n\n00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.885\nget things wrong,\n\n00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:59.569\nways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,\n\n00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.158\ndistort reality, or see what we want to see,\n\n00:04:03.158 --> 00:04:05.390\nand the bias I'm talking about\n\n00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.828\nworks like this:\n\n00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:09.063\nConfront someone with the fact\n\n00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:10.610\nthat they are going to die\n\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.643\nand they will believe just about any story\n\n00:04:13.643 --> 00:04:15.501\nthat tells them it isn't true\n\n00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:17.915\nand they can, instead, live forever,\n\n00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:22.000\neven if it means taking the existential elevator.\n\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.428\nNow we can see this as the biggest bias of all.\n\n00:04:26.428 --> 00:04:29.303\nIt has been demonstrated in over 400\n\n00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:30.984\nempirical studies.\n\n00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:33.493\nNow these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.\n\n00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:35.428\nThey work like this.\n\n00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:36.918\nYou take two groups of people\n\n00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:39.701\nwho are similar in all relevant respects,\n\n00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:42.390\nand you remind one group that they're going to die\n\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.019\nbut not the other, then you compare their behavior.\n\n00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:48.892\nSo you're observing how it biases behavior\n\n00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:52.646\nwhen people become aware of their mortality.\n\n00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:55.558\nAnd every time, you get the same result:\n\n00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:58.645\nPeople who are made aware of their mortality\n\n00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:00.656\nare more willing to believe stories\n\n00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:02.519\nthat tell them they can escape death\n\n00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.291\nand live forever.\n\n00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:06.580\nSo here's an example: One recent study\n\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.350\ntook two groups of agnostics,\n\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.946\nthat is people who are undecided\n\n00:05:10.946 --> 00:05:13.461\nin their religious beliefs.\n\n00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:17.045\nNow, one group was asked to think about being dead.\n\n00:05:17.045 --> 00:05:18.690\nThe other group was asked to think about\n\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.523\nbeing lonely.\n\n00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:23.339\nThey were then asked again\nabout their religious beliefs.\n\n00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.203\nThose who had been asked\nto think about being dead\n\n00:05:26.203 --> 00:05:29.776\nwere afterwards twice as likely to express faith\n\n00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.436\nin God and Jesus.\n\n00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:33.214\nTwice as likely.\n\n00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:35.922\nEven though the before they\nwere all equally agnostic.\n\n00:05:35.922 --> 00:05:37.683\nBut put the fear of death in them,\n\n00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:41.542\nand they run to Jesus.\n\n00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:45.054\nNow, this shows that reminding people of death\n\n00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.299\nbiases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,\n\n00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:50.324\nand it works not just for religion,\n\n00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:52.561\nbut for any kind of belief system\n\n00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:56.021\nthat promises immortality in some form,\n\n00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:57.826\nwhether it's becoming famous\n\n00:05:57.826 --> 00:05:59.240\nor having children\n\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.587\nor even nationalism,\n\n00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:03.860\nwhich promises you can live\non as part of a greater whole.\n\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.791\nThis is a bias that has shaped\n\n00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:09.130\nthe course of human history.\n\n00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.397\nNow, the theory behind this bias\n\n00:06:11.397 --> 00:06:13.134\nin the over 400 studies\n\n00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:15.263\nis called terror management theory,\n\n00:06:15.263 --> 00:06:17.613\nand the idea is simple. It's just this.\n\n00:06:17.613 --> 00:06:20.162\nWe develop our worldviews,\n\n00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:22.319\nthat is, the stories we tell ourselves\n\n00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.055\nabout the world and our place in it,\n\n00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:27.337\nin order to help us manage\n\n00:06:27.337 --> 00:06:30.251\nthe terror of death.\n\n00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:32.050\nAnd these immortality stories\n\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.047\nhave thousands of different manifestations,\n\n00:06:35.047 --> 00:06:38.631\nbut I believe that behind the apparent diversity\n\n00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.330\nthere are actually just four basic forms\n\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.841\nthat these immortality stories can take.\n\n00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:46.646\nAnd we can see them repeating themselves\n\n00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:49.816\nthroughout history, just with slight variations\n\n00:06:49.816 --> 00:06:52.581\nto reflect the vocabulary of the day.\n\n00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.089\nNow I'm going to briefly introduce these four\n\n00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.342\nbasic forms of immortality story,\n\n00:06:57.342 --> 00:06:58.912\nand I want to try to give you some sense\n\n00:06:58.912 --> 00:07:01.225\nof the way in which they're retold by each culture\n\n00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:02.992\nor generation\n\n00:07:02.992 --> 00:07:05.164\nusing the vocabulary of their day.\n\n00:07:05.164 --> 00:07:07.803\nNow, the first story is the simplest.\n\n00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:09.956\nWe want to avoid death,\n\n00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:12.381\nand the dream of doing that in this body\n\n00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:13.741\nin this world forever\n\n00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:17.032\nis the first and simplest kind of immortality story,\n\n00:07:17.032 --> 00:07:19.491\nand it might at first sound implausible,\n\n00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:23.472\nbut actually, almost every culture in human history\n\n00:07:23.472 --> 00:07:25.534\nhas had some myth or legend\n\n00:07:25.534 --> 00:07:28.295\nof an elixir of life or a fountain of youth\n\n00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:31.274\nor something that promises to keep us going\n\n00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:34.411\nforever.\n\n00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:36.004\nAncient Egypt had such myths,\n\n00:07:36.004 --> 00:07:38.372\nancient Babylon, ancient India.\n\n00:07:38.372 --> 00:07:41.224\nThroughout European history, we find them\nin the work of the alchemists,\n\n00:07:41.224 --> 00:07:44.018\nand of course we still believe this today,\n\n00:07:44.018 --> 00:07:46.581\nonly we tell this story using the vocabulary\n\n00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:48.237\nof science.\n\n00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:49.843\nSo 100 years ago,\n\n00:07:49.843 --> 00:07:51.662\nhormones had just been discovered,\n\n00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:53.314\nand people hoped that hormone treatments\n\n00:07:53.314 --> 00:07:56.013\nwere going to cure aging and disease,\n\n00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:58.866\nand now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,\n\n00:07:58.866 --> 00:08:01.161\ngenetic engineering, and nanotechnology.\n\n00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:05.119\nBut the idea that science can cure death\n\n00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:07.460\nis just one more chapter in the story\n\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.693\nof the magical elixir,\n\n00:08:09.693 --> 00:08:14.129\na story that is as old as civilization.\n\n00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:16.909\nBut betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir\n\n00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:18.312\nand staying alive forever\n\n00:08:18.312 --> 00:08:20.113\nis a risky strategy.\n\n00:08:20.113 --> 00:08:22.353\nWhen we look back through history\n\n00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:25.137\nat all those who have sought an elixir in the past,\n\n00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.966\nthe one thing they now have in common\n\n00:08:26.966 --> 00:08:29.596\nis that they're all dead.\n\n00:08:29.596 --> 00:08:33.334\nSo we need a backup plan,\nand exactly this kind of plan B\n\n00:08:33.334 --> 00:08:36.905\nis what the second kind of immortality story offers,\n\n00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:38.660\nand that's resurrection.\n\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.034\nAnd it stays with the idea that I am this body,\n\n00:08:41.034 --> 00:08:43.009\nI am this physical organism.\n\n00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:45.177\nIt accepts that I'm going to have to die\n\n00:08:45.177 --> 00:08:46.551\nbut says, despite that,\n\n00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:49.054\nI can rise up and I can live again.\n\n00:08:49.054 --> 00:08:51.672\nIn other words, I can do what Jesus did.\n\n00:08:51.672 --> 00:08:53.717\nJesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],\n\n00:08:53.717 --> 00:08:56.828\nand then he rose up and lived again.\n\n00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.947\nAnd the idea that we can all be\nresurrected to live again\n\n00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:02.235\nis orthodox believe, not just for Christians\n\n00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:04.938\nbut also Jews and Muslims.\n\n00:09:04.938 --> 00:09:07.102\nBut our desire to believe this story\n\n00:09:07.102 --> 00:09:09.112\nis so deeply embedded\n\n00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:11.210\nthat we are reinventing it again\n\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.702\nfor the scientific age,\n\n00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:15.525\nfor example, with the idea of cryonics.\n\n00:09:15.525 --> 00:09:17.115\nThat's the idea that when you die,\n\n00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:19.114\nyou can have yourself frozen,\n\n00:09:19.114 --> 00:09:21.503\nand then, at some point when technology\n\n00:09:21.503 --> 00:09:22.714\nhas advanced enough,\n\n00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:24.834\nyou can be thawed out and repaired and revived\n\n00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:26.123\nand so resurrected.\n\n00:09:26.123 --> 00:09:28.971\nAnd so some people believe an omnipotent god\n\n00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:30.850\nwill resurrect them to live again,\n\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.993\nand other people believe an \nomnipotent scientist will do it.\n\n00:09:34.993 --> 00:09:37.707\nBut for others, the whole idea of resurrection,\n\n00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:39.710\nof climbing out of the grave,\n\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.429\nit's just too much like a bad zombie movie.\n\n00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:45.220\nThey find the body too messy, too unreliable\n\n00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.368\nto guarantee eternal life,\n\n00:09:47.368 --> 00:09:50.459\nand so they set their hopes on the third,\n\n00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:52.576\nmore spiritual immortality story,\n\n00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:54.912\nthe idea that we can leave our body behind\n\n00:09:54.912 --> 00:09:57.209\nand live on as a soul.\n\n00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:59.198\nNow, the majority of people on Earth\n\n00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:00.971\nbelieve they have a soul,\n\n00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.381\nand the idea is central to many religions.\n\n00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:05.695\nBut even though, in its current form,\n\n00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:07.610\nin its traditional form,\n\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.773\nthe idea of the soul is still hugely popular,\n\n00:10:09.773 --> 00:10:11.205\nnonetheless we are again\n\n00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:13.429\nreinventing it for the digital age,\n\n00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:14.906\nfor example with the idea\n\n00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.896\nthat you can leave your body behind\n\n00:10:16.896 --> 00:10:19.142\nby uploading your mind, your essence,\n\n00:10:19.142 --> 00:10:21.098\nthe real you, onto a computer,\n\n00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:25.710\nand so live on as an avatar in the ether.\n\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.733\nBut of course there are skeptics who say\n\n00:10:27.733 --> 00:10:29.577\nif we look at the evidence of science,\n\n00:10:29.577 --> 00:10:31.221\nparticularly neuroscience,\n\n00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:33.050\nit suggests that your mind,\n\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.630\nyour essence, the real you,\n\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.043\nis very much dependent on a particular part\n\n00:10:37.043 --> 00:10:39.264\nof your body, that is, your brain.\n\n00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.785\nAnd such skeptics can find comfort\n\n00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:44.043\nin the fourth kind of immortality story,\n\n00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.400\nand that is legacy,\n\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.880\nthe idea that you can live on\n\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.131\nthrough the echo you leave in the world,\n\n00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:52.480\nlike the great Greek warrior Achilles,\n\n00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.109\nwho sacrificed his life fighting at Troy\n\n00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:58.162\nso that he might win immortal fame.\n\n00:10:58.162 --> 00:11:00.428\nAnd the pursuit of fame is as widespread\n\n00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:02.569\nand popular now as it ever was,\n\n00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:04.148\nand in our digital age,\n\n00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:05.676\nit's even easier to achieve.\n\n00:11:05.676 --> 00:11:08.000\nYou don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles\n\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.693\nor a great king or hero.\n\n00:11:09.693 --> 00:11:14.516\nAll you need is an Internet connection\nand a funny cat. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:16.979\nBut some people prefer to leave a more tangible,\n\n00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:19.823\nbiological legacy -- children, for example.\n\n00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:22.099\nOr they like, they hope, to live on\n\n00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:23.816\nas part of some greater whole,\n\n00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.265\na nation or a family or a tribe,\n\n00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:28.731\ntheir gene pool.\n\n00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:30.244\nBut again, there are skeptics\n\n00:11:30.244 --> 00:11:31.957\nwho doubt whether legacy\n\n00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:33.932\nreally is immortality.\n\n00:11:33.932 --> 00:11:36.009\nWoody Allen, for example, who said,\n\n00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:38.505\n\"I don't want to live on in\nthe hearts of my countrymen.\n\n00:11:38.505 --> 00:11:40.702\nI want to live on in my apartment.\"\n\n00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:42.469\nSo those are the four\n\n00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:44.652\nbasic kinds of immortality stories,\n\n00:11:44.652 --> 00:11:46.294\nand I've tried to give just some sense\n\n00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:48.587\nof how they're retold by each generation\n\n00:11:48.587 --> 00:11:50.174\nwith just slight variations\n\n00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:52.479\nto fit the fashions of the day.\n\n00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:55.968\nAnd the fact that they recur in this way,\n\n00:11:55.968 --> 00:11:58.956\nin such a similar form but\nin such different belief systems,\n\n00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:00.534\nsuggests, I think,\n\n00:12:00.534 --> 00:12:02.936\nthat we should be skeptical of the truth\n\n00:12:02.936 --> 00:12:06.697\nof any particular version of these stories.\n\n00:12:06.697 --> 00:12:08.808\nThe fact that some people believe\n\n00:12:08.808 --> 00:12:11.473\nan omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again\n\n00:12:11.473 --> 00:12:15.174\nand others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it\n\n00:12:15.174 --> 00:12:18.212\nsuggests that neither are really believing this\n\n00:12:18.212 --> 00:12:20.882\non the strength of the evidence.\n\n00:12:20.882 --> 00:12:23.308\nRather, we believe these stories\n\n00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:25.291\nbecause we are biased to believe them,\n\n00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:27.119\nand we are biased to believe them\n\n00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:31.389\nbecause we are so afraid of death.\n\n00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:33.444\nSo the question is,\n\n00:12:33.444 --> 00:12:36.916\nare we doomed to lead the one life we have\n\n00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:40.609\nin a way that is shaped by fear and denial,\n\n00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:43.684\nor can we overcome this bias?\n\n00:12:43.684 --> 00:12:46.151\nWell the Greek philosopher Epicurus\n\n00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.879\nthought we could.\n\n00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:51.427\nHe argued that the fear of death is natural,\n\n00:12:51.427 --> 00:12:53.842\nbut it is not rational.\n\n00:12:53.842 --> 00:12:56.500\n\"Death,\" he said, \"is nothing to us,\n\n00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.350\nbecause when we are here, death is not,\n\n00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.103\nand when death is here, we are gone.\"\n\n00:13:03.103 --> 00:13:04.901\nNow this is often quoted, but it's difficult\n\n00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:07.223\nto really grasp, to really internalize,\n\n00:13:07.223 --> 00:13:09.386\nbecause exactly this idea of being gone\n\n00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:11.525\nis so difficult to imagine.\n\n00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:13.756\nSo 2,000 years later, another philosopher,\n\n00:13:13.756 --> 00:13:17.213\nLudwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:\n\n00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:20.157\n\"Death is not an event in life:\n\n00:13:20.157 --> 00:13:23.799\nWe do not live to experience death.\n\n00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:24.993\nAnd so,\" he added,\n\n00:13:24.993 --> 00:13:27.928\n\"in this sense, life has no end.\"\n\n00:13:27.928 --> 00:13:31.104\nSo it was natural for me as a child\n\n00:13:31.104 --> 00:13:33.471\nto fear being swallowed by the void,\n\n00:13:33.471 --> 00:13:35.350\nbut it wasn't rational,\n\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.335\nbecause being swallowed by the void\n\n00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:39.413\nis not something that any of us\n\n00:13:39.413 --> 00:13:42.683\nwill ever live to experience.\n\n00:13:42.683 --> 00:13:45.212\nNow, overcoming this bias is not easy because\n\n00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:48.171\nthe fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,\n\n00:13:48.171 --> 00:13:52.653\nyet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,\n\n00:13:52.653 --> 00:13:54.783\nand when we bring out into the open\n\n00:13:54.783 --> 00:13:57.481\nthe ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,\n\n00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:59.332\nthen we can at least start\n\n00:13:59.332 --> 00:14:01.966\nto try to minimize the influence it has\n\n00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.849\non our lives.\n\n00:14:03.849 --> 00:14:06.667\nNow, I find it helps to see life\n\n00:14:06.667 --> 00:14:08.511\nas being like a book:\n\n00:14:08.511 --> 00:14:10.979\nJust as a book is bounded by its covers,\n\n00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:12.256\nby beginning and end,\n\n00:14:12.256 --> 00:14:15.994\nso our lives are bounded by birth and death,\n\n00:14:15.994 --> 00:14:19.509\nand even though a book is\nlimited by beginning and end,\n\n00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:21.645\nit can encompass distant landscapes,\n\n00:14:21.645 --> 00:14:24.875\nexotic figures, fantastic adventures.\n\n00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:28.224\nAnd even though a book is\nlimited by beginning and end,\n\n00:14:28.224 --> 00:14:30.047\nthe characters within it\n\n00:14:30.047 --> 00:14:32.889\nknow no horizons.\n\n00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:36.046\nThey only know the moments\nthat make up their story,\n\n00:14:36.046 --> 00:14:38.986\neven when the book is closed.\n\n00:14:38.986 --> 00:14:41.122\nAnd so the characters of a book\n\n00:14:41.122 --> 00:14:44.604\nare not afraid of reaching the last page.\n\n00:14:44.604 --> 00:14:46.882\nLong John Silver is not afraid of you\n\n00:14:46.882 --> 00:14:49.717\nfinishing your copy of \"Treasure Island.\"\n\n00:14:49.717 --> 00:14:51.417\nAnd so it should be with us.\n\n00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:53.561\nImagine the book of your life,\n\n00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:56.345\nits

"https://www.ted.com/talks/rose_george_inside_the_secret_shipping_industry", "transcript": "A couple of years ago, Harvard Business School chose the best business model of that year. It chose Somali piracy. Pretty much around the same time, I discovered that there were 544 seafarers being held hostage on ships, often anchored just off the Somali coast in plain sight.And I learned these two facts, and I thought, what's going on in shipping? And I thought, would that happen in any other industry? Would we see 544 airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months, or a year? Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers? It wouldn't happen.So I started to get intrigued. And I discovered another fact, which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before at the age of 42, 43. That is how fundamentally  we still depend on shipping. Because perhaps the general public thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry, something brought by sailboat with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows. But shipping isn't that. Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been. Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade. Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970. We are more dependent on it now than ever. And yet, for such an enormous industry \u2014 there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea \u2014 it's become pretty much invisible.Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that, because here shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel. (Laughter) But elsewhere in the world, if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea, you will get essentially a blank face. You will ask someone on the street if they've heard of Microsoft. I should think they'll say yes, because they'll know that they make software that goes on computers, and occasionally works. But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk, I doubt you'd get the same response, even though Maersk, which is just one shipping company amongst many, has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft. [$60.2 billion]Now why is this? A few years ago, the first sea lord of the British admiralty \u2014 he is called the first sea lord, although the chief of the army is not called a land lord \u2014 he said that we, and he meant in the industrialized nations in the West, that we suffer from sea blindness. We are blind to the sea as a place of industry or of work. It's just something we fly over, a patch of blue on an airline map. Nothing to see, move along.So I wanted to open my own eyes to my own sea blindness, so I ran away to sea. A couple of years ago, I took a passage on the Maersk Kendal, a mid-sized container ship carrying nearly 7,000 boxes, and I departed from Felixstowe, on the south coast of England, and I ended up right here in Singapore five weeks later, considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now. And it was a revelation. We traveled through five seas, two oceans, nine ports, and I learned a lot about shipping.And one of the first things that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was, where are all the people? I have friends in the Navy who tell me they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time, but on Kendal there were only 21 crew. Now that's because shipping is very efficient. Containerization has made it very efficient. Ships have automation now. They can operate with small crews. But it also means that, in the words of a port chaplain I once met, the average seafarer you're going to find on a container ship is either tired or exhausted, because the pace of modern shipping is quite punishing for what the shipping calls its human element, a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize sounds a little bit inhuman. So most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time. They don't have time to relax. They're at sea for months at a time, and even when they're on board, they don't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.And another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was who I was sitting next to \u2014 Not the queen; I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait \u2014 But around that dining table in the officer's saloon, I was sitting next to a Burmese guy, I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian. On the next table was a Chinese guy, and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos. So that was a normal working ship.Now how is that possible? Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last 60 years, when most of the general public stopped noticing it, was something called an open registry, or a flag of convenience. Ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry. You can get a flag from the landlocked nation of Bolivia, or Mongolia, or North Korea, though that's not very popular. (Laughter)So we have these very multinational, global, mobile crews on ships. And that was a surprise to me. And when we got to pirate waters, down the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean, the ship changed. And that was also shocking, because suddenly, I realized, as the captain said to me, that I had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship. We were no longer allowed on deck. There were double pirate watches. And at that time, there were those  544 seafarers being held hostage, and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience. Not all of them, but some of them were, because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners, it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.What else does our sea blindness mask? Well, if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel, you'll see very black smoke. And that's because shipping has very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel, so they use something called bunker fuel, which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery, or just one step up from asphalt. And shipping is the greenest method of transport. In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile, it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking. But it's not benign, because there's so much of it. So shipping emissions are about three to four percent, almost the same as aviation's. And if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries' carbon emissions, it would come in about sixth, somewhere near Germany. It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world. And the good news is that people are now talking about sustainable shipping. There are interesting initiatives going on. But why has it taken so long? When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles?I also traveled to Cape Cod to look at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale, because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea, and what it made me think about. We know about man's impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing, but we don't really know much about what's happening underneath the water. And in fact, shipping has a role to play here, because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures. Light doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water, so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even 800 species of fish communicate by sound. And a North Atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles. A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean. But a supertanker can also be heard coming across a whole ocean, and because the noise that propellers make underwater is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use, then it can damage their acoustic habitat, and they need this for breeding, for finding feeding grounds, for finding mates. And the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent. But there are no laws governing  acoustic pollution yet.And when I arrived in Singapore, and I apologize for this, but I  didn't want to get off my ship. I'd really loved being on board Kendal. I'd been well treated by the crew, I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain, and I would happily have signed up for another five weeks, something that the captain also said I was crazy to think about. But I wasn't there for nine months at a time like the Filipino seafarers, who, when I asked them to describe their job to me, called it \"dollar for homesickness.\" They had good salaries, but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element.But when I get to this part, I'm in two minds, because I want to salute those seafarers who bring us 90 percent of everything and get very little thanks or recognition for it. I want to salute the 100,000 ships that are at sea that are doing that work, coming in and out every day, bringing us what we need. But I also want to see shipping, and us, the general public, who know so little about it, to have a bit more scrutiny, to be a bit more transparent, to have 90 percent transparency. Because I think we could all benefit from doing something very simple, which is learning to see the sea.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1887, "subtitle":

ships.\n\n00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:21.270\nAnd that was a surprise to me.\n\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.387\nAnd when we got to pirate waters,\n\n00:06:24.387 --> 00:06:27.513\ndown the Bab-el-Mandeb strait\nand into the Indian Ocean,\n\n00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:29.265\nthe ship changed.\n\n00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:32.408\nAnd that was also shocking, because suddenly,\n\n00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:34.622\nI realized, as the captain said to me,\n\n00:06:34.622 --> 00:06:36.624\nthat I had been crazy to choose to go\n\n00:06:36.624 --> 00:06:39.676\nthrough pirate waters on a container ship.\n\n00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:41.667\nWe were no longer allowed on deck.\n\n00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:44.263\nThere were double pirate watches.\n\n00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:48.540\nAnd at that time, there were those \n544 seafarers being held hostage,\n\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.508\nand some of them were held hostage for years\n\n00:06:50.508 --> 00:06:53.279\nbecause of the nature of shipping\nand the flag of convenience.\n\n00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.361\nNot all of them, but some of them were,\n\n00:06:55.361 --> 00:07:00.075\nbecause for the minority\nof unscrupulous ship owners,\n\n00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:02.620\nit can be easy to hide behind\n\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.619\nthe anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.\n\n00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:11.558\nWhat else does our sea blindness mask?\n\n00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:13.877\nWell, if you go out to sea on a ship\n\n00:07:13.877 --> 00:07:15.872\nor on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,\n\n00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:18.741\nyou'll see very black smoke.\n\n00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:21.276\nAnd that's because shipping\n\n00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:23.863\nhas very tight margins,\nand they want cheap fuel,\n\n00:07:23.863 --> 00:07:26.034\nso they use something called bunker fuel,\n\n00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:28.550\nwhich was described to me\nby someone in the tanker industry\n\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.716\nas the dregs of the refinery,\n\n00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:33.973\nor just one step up from asphalt.\n\n00:07:33.973 --> 00:07:37.370\nAnd shipping is the greenest method of transport.\n\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.713\nIn terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,\n\n00:07:39.713 --> 00:07:42.684\nit emits about a thousandth of aviation\n\n00:07:42.684 --> 00:07:44.799\nand about a tenth of trucking.\n\n00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:48.035\nBut it's not benign, because there's so much of it.\n\n00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.565\nSo shipping emissions are\nabout three to four percent,\n\n00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:52.740\nalmost the same as aviation's.\n\n00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.129\nAnd if you put shipping emissions\n\n00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:57.509\non a list of the countries' carbon emissions,\n\n00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:59.122\nit would come in about sixth,\n\n00:07:59.122 --> 00:08:01.236\nsomewhere near Germany.\n\n00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:05.254\nIt was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships\n\n00:08:05.254 --> 00:08:07.849\npollute in terms of particles and soot\n\n00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:09.249\nand noxious gases\n\n00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:11.827\nas much as all the cars in the world.\n\n00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:13.227\nAnd the good news is that\n\n00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:15.422\npeople are now talking about sustainable shipping.\n\n00:08:15.422 --> 00:08:17.909\nThere are interesting initiatives going on.\n\n00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:20.164\nBut why has it taken so long?\n\n00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:22.511\nWhen are we going to start talking and thinking\n\n00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:26.547\nabout shipping miles as well as air miles?\n\n00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:29.352\nI also traveled to Cape Cod to look\n\n00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:33.279\nat the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,\n\n00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.435\nbecause this to me was one\nof the most surprising things\n\n00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:37.391\nabout my time at sea,\n\n00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:39.188\nand what it made me think about.\n\n00:08:39.188 --> 00:08:42.341\nWe know about man's impact on the ocean\n\n00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:44.773\nin terms of fishing and overfishing,\n\n00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:46.581\nbut we don't really know much about\n\n00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:48.764\nwhat's happening underneath the water.\n\n00:08:48.764 --> 00:08:51.369\nAnd in fact, shipping has a role to play here,\n\n00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:55.015\nbecause shipping noise has contributed\n\n00:08:55.015 --> 00:08:58.208\nto damaging the acoustic\nhabitats of ocean creatures.\n\n00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:01.200\nLight doesn't penetrate beneath\nthe surface of the water,\n\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.827\nso ocean creatures like whales and dolphins\n\n00:09:03.827 --> 00:09:06.131\nand even 800 species of fish\n\n00:09:06.131 --> 00:09:09.022\ncommunicate by sound.\n\n00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:10.735\nAnd a North Atlantic right whale\n\n00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:13.942\ncan transmit across hundreds of miles.\n\n00:09:13.942 --> 00:09:15.905\nA humpback can transmit a sound\n\n00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:17.843\nacross a whole ocean.\n\n00:09:17.843 --> 00:09:19.798\nBut a supertanker can also be heard\n\n00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:21.869\ncoming across a whole ocean,\n\n00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:24.433\nand because the noise that\npropellers make underwater\n\n00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:27.770\nis sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,\n\n00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.804\nthen it can damage their acoustic habitat,\n\n00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:32.494\nand they need this for breeding,\n\n00:09:32.494 --> 00:09:34.145\nfor finding feeding grounds,\n\n00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:36.668\nfor finding mates.\n\n00:09:36.668 --> 00:09:39.509\nAnd the acoustic habitat of the\nNorth Atlantic right whale\n\n00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:42.859\nhas been reduced by up to 90 percent.\n\n00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:47.471\nBut there are no laws governing \nacoustic pollution yet.\n\n00:09:47.471 --> 00:09:50.727\nAnd when I arrived in Singapore,\n\n00:09:50.727 --> 00:09:55.631\nand I apologize for this, but I \ndidn't want to get off my ship.\n\n00:09:55.634 --> 00:09:58.593\nI'd really loved being on board Kendal.\n\n00:09:58.593 --> 00:10:00.488\nI'd been well treated by the crew,\n\n00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:04.029\nI'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,\n\n00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:08.101\nand I would happily have signed up\nfor another five weeks,\n\n00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:09.932\nsomething that the captain also said\n\n00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:12.205\nI was crazy to think about.\n\n00:10:12.205 --> 00:10:14.449\nBut I wasn't there for nine months at a time\n\n00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:16.404\nlike the Filipino seafarers,\n\n00:10:16.404 --> 00:10:18.643\nwho, when I asked them to describe their job to me,\n\n00:10:18.643 --> 00:10:20.965\ncalled it \"dollar for homesickness.\"\n\n00:10:20.965 --> 00:10:22.443\nThey had good salaries,\n\n00:10:22.443 --> 00:10:25.474\nbut theirs is still an isolating and difficult life\n\n00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:29.163\nin a dangerous and often difficult element.\n\n00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:31.249\nBut when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,\n\n00:10:31.249 --> 00:10:34.174\nbecause I want to salute those seafarers\n\n00:10:34.174 --> 00:10:36.361\nwho bring us 90 percent of everything\n\n00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:40.027\nand get very little thanks or recognition for it.\n\n00:10:40.027 --> 00:10:42.748\nI want to salute the 100,000 ships\n\n00:10:42.748 --> 00:10:44.071\nthat are at sea\n\n00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:46.604\nthat are doing that work, coming in and out\n\n00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.833\nevery day, bringing us what we need.\n\n00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:52.853\nBut I also want to see shipping,\n\n00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:56.332\nand us, the general public,\nwho know so little about it,\n\n00:10:56.332 --> 00:10:58.372\nto have a bit more scrutiny,\n\n00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:00.476\nto be a bit more transparent,\n\n00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:03.748\nto have 90 percent transparency.\n\n00:11:03.748 --> 00:11:06.649\nBecause I think we could all benefit\n\n00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:08.754\nfrom doing something very simple,\n\n00:11:08.754 --> 00:11:11.836\nwhich is learning to see the sea.\n\n00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.994\nThank you.\n\n00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:18.302\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A new vision for rebuilding Detroit", "duration": "708", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/toni_griffin_a_new_vision_for_rebuilding_detroit", "transcript": "By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis. There was a housing collapse, an auto industry collapse, and the population had plummeted by 25 percent between 2000 and 2010, and many people were beginning to write it off, as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities. By 2010, I had also been asked by the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future. I come to this work as an architect and an urban planner, and I've spent my career working in other contested cities, like Chicago, my hometown; Harlem, which is my current home; Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey. All of these cities, to me, still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice, issues of equity, inclusion and access.Now by 2010, as well, popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit, and devoting whole issues to \"fixing the city.\" I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein, to do an interview for the October issue of Architect magazine, and he and I kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title, \"Can This Planner Save Detroit?\" So I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now, because obviously, it's completely absurd that a single person, let alone a planner, could save a city. But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession could play a role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis. So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit, and I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters.So we began our process in September of 2010. It's just after a special mayoral election, and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide planning process, which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among Detroiters. We had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process, and people came out from all over the city, including areas that were stable neighborhoods, as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy. And most of our audience was representative of the 82 percent African-American population in the city at that time. So obviously, we have a Q&A portion of our program, and people line up to mics to ask questions. Many of them step very firmly to the mic, put their hands across their chest, and go, \"I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?\"So that question is really powerful, and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment, when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had, and actually a lot of African-Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit. Many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great-grandparents, who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated from the rural South to the industrial North, as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence, \"The Great Migration.\" They came to Detroit for a better way of life. Many found work in the automobile industry, the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art. The fruits of their labors would afford them a home, for many the first piece of property that they would ever know, and a community with other first-time African-American home buyers. The first couple of decades of their life in the North is quite well, up until about 1950, which coincides with the city's peak population at 1.8 million people. Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see a second kind of migration, a migration to the suburbs. Between 1950 and 2000, the region grows by 30 percent. But this time, the migration leaves African-Americans in place, as families and businesses flee the city, leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. During that same period, between 1950 and 2000, 2010, the city loses 60 percent of its population, and today it hovers at above 700,000.The audience members who come and talk to us that night tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city with such depleted population. Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes on their block that are occupied, and that they can see several abandoned homes from where they sit on their porches. Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes. They can also see vacant property. They're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties, like illegal dumping, and they know that because the city has lost so much population, their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising, because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need. Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale, because I know that sounds like a big number, but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map. So the city is 139 square miles. You can fit Boston, San Francisco, and the island of Manhattan within its footprint. So if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together, it looks like about 20 square miles, and that's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan, at 22 square miles. So it's a lot of vacancy.Now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities, and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots, and they're starting community gardens, which are creating a great sense of community stewardship, but they're very, very clear to tell us that this is not enough, that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them.Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010 about what to do with the vacant property, and a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening, or what we call urban agriculture. So many people would say to us, \"What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland? It can provide fresh foods, and it can put Detroiters back to work too.\" When I hear that story, I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration rolling over in their graves, because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice moving from the South to the North to create a better life for their families, only to see their great-grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle, especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the American dream: steady work and a home that they owned.Now, there's a third wave of migration happening in Detroit: a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs. These folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new, entrepreneurial ideas and profit, so much so that former models can move to Detroit, buy property, start successful businesses and restaurants, and become successful community activists in their neighborhood, bringing about very positive change. Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city. This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch and bicycle company, deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit, and they quote themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand  of Detroit's innovation. And they also knew that  they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things. Now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods, we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises, and we have businesses relocating, and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all, a city that's under the control of an emergency manager, and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013, we released Detroit Future City, which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence \u2014 not what it was, but what it could be, looking at new ways of economic growth, new forms of land use, more sustainable and denser neighborhoods, a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system, and a heightened capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change. Three key imperatives were really important to our work. One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large, but the economy was too small. There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit, very different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia that are anywhere between  35 to 70 jobs per 100 people. Secondly, there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come. It wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before, and urban agriculture, while a very productive and successful intervention happening in Detroit, was not the only answer, that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new, productive, innovative, and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities, where still nearly 300,000 residents lived.So we came up with one neighborhood typology \u2014 there are several \u2014 called a live-make neighborhood, where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises, with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again, majority 82 percent African-American population. So they, too, could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided. Then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses, so that it could be used for storm water management, for example, by using surface lakes and retention ponds, that created neighborhood amenities, places of recreation, and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels. Or we could use it as research plots, where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils, or we could use it to generate energy.So the descendants of the Great Migration could either become precision watchmakers at Shinola, like Willie H., who was featured in one of their ads last year, or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like Shinola. The good news is, there is a future for the next generation of Detroiters, both those there now and those that want to come.So no thank you, Mayor Menino, who recently was quoted as saying, \"I'd blow up the place and start over.\" There are very important people, business and land assets in Detroit, and there are real opportunities there. So while Detroit might not be what it was, Detroit will not die.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1892, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.502 -->

cities, to me, still had a number\n\n00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:01.730\nof unresolved issues related to urban justice,\n\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.082\nissues of equity, inclusion and access.\n\n00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:08.145\nNow by 2010, as well,\n\n00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:10.160\npopular design magazines were also beginning\n\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.873\nto take a closer look at cities like Detroit,\n\n00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:16.510\nand devoting whole issues to \"fixing the city.\"\n\n00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.886\nI was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,\n\n00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:20.861\nto do an interview for the October issue\n\n00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:22.512\nof Architect magazine,\n\n00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:24.167\nand he and I kind of had a good chuckle\n\n00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.383\nwhen we saw the magazine released with the title,\n\n00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:30.269\n\"Can This Planner Save Detroit?\"\n\n00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:33.144\nSo I'm smiling with a little bit\nof embarrassment right now,\n\n00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:35.551\nbecause obviously, it's completely absurd\n\n00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:37.523\nthat a single person, let alone a planner,\n\n00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:38.981\ncould save a city.\n\n00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:41.482\nBut I'm also smiling because I thought it represented\n\n00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:44.116\na sense of hopefulness that our profession\n\n00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:47.034\ncould play a role in helping the city to think about\n\n00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:51.098\nhow it would recover from its severe crisis.\n\n00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:53.370\nSo I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon\n\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.051\nand tell you a little bit about our process\n\n00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:57.727\nfor fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,\n\n00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:00.841\nand I want to do that through\nthe voices of Detroiters.\n\n00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.909\nSo we began our process in September of 2010.\n\n00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.838\nIt's just after a special mayoral election,\n\n00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:08.879\nand word has gotten out that there is going to be\n\n00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.423\nthis citywide planning process,\n\n00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:12.772\nwhich brings a lot of anxiety and fears\n\n00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:14.555\namong Detroiters.\n\n00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.800\nWe had planned to hold a number\nof community meetings in rooms like this\n\n00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.184\nto introduce the planning process,\n\n00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:23.180\nand people came out from all over the city,\n\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.031\nincluding areas that were stable neighborhoods,\n\n00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:27.807\nas well as areas that were beginning to see\n\n00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:29.801\na lot of vacancy.\n\n00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.899\nAnd most of our audience was representative\n\n00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.452\nof the 82 percent African-American population\n\n00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:36.717\nin the city at that time.\n\n00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:40.205\nSo obviously, we have a Q&amp;A portion of our program,\n\n00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:43.102\nand people line up to mics to ask questions.\n\n00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:45.861\nMany of them step very firmly to the mic,\n\n00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:48.709\nput their hands across their chest, and go,\n\n00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.188\n\"I know you people are trying to\nmove me out of my house, right?\"\n\n00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:54.507\nSo that question is really powerful,\n\n00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.720\nand it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,\n\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.829\nwhen you connect it to the stories\n\n00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.216\nthat some Detroiters had,\n\n00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:03.422\nand actually a lot of African-Americans'\n\n00:03:03.422 --> 00:03:04.879\nfamilies have had\n\n00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.610\nthat are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.\n\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.945\nMany of them told us the stories about\n\n00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.405\nhow they came to own their home\n\n00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:14.569\nthrough their grandparents or great-grandparents,\n\n00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.443\nwho were one of 1.6 million people who migrated\n\n00:03:17.443 --> 00:03:20.136\nfrom the rural South to the industrial North,\n\n00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:22.484\nas depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,\n\n00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.110\n\"The Great Migration.\"\n\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.353\nThey came to Detroit for a better way of life.\n\n00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:29.957\nMany found work in the automobile industry,\n\n00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:32.358\nthe Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural\n\n00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:36.413\nby Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.\n\n00:03:36.413 --> 00:03:39.388\nThe fruits of their labors would afford them a home,\n\n00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:42.269\nfor many the first piece of property\nthat they would ever know,\n\n00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.132\nand a community with other first-time\n\n00:03:44.132 --> 00:03:46.261\nAfrican-American home buyers.\n\n00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:48.641\nThe first couple of decades of their life in the North\n\n00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:51.685\nis quite well, up until about 1950,\n\n00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:54.293\nwhich coincides with the city's peak population\n\n00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:56.600\nat 1.8 million people.\n\n00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.978\nNow it's at this time that Detroit begins to see\n\n00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:01.196\na second kind of migration,\n\n00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.529\na migration to the suburbs.\n\n00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.366\nBetween 1950 and 2000,\n\n00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:09.301\nthe region grows by 30 percent.\n\n00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:11.200\nBut this time, the migration leaves\n\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.305\nAfrican-Americans in place,\n\n00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:16.251\nas families and businesses flee the city,\n\n00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:18.613\nleaving the city pretty desolate of people\n\n00:04:18.613 --> 00:04:20.367\nas well as jobs.\n\n00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:25.167\nDuring that same period, between\n1950 and 2000, 2010,\n\n00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:28.032\nthe city loses 60 percent of its population,\n\n00:04:28.032 --> 00:04:31.956\nand today it hovers at above 700,000.\n\n00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:34.442\nThe audience members who come\nand talk to us that night\n\n00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:37.227\ntell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city\n\n00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:39.944\nwith such depleted population.\n\n00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:42.294\nMany tell us that they're one of only a few homes\n\n00:04:42.294 --> 00:04:44.837\non their block that are occupied,\n\n00:04:44.837 --> 00:04:47.444\nand that they can see several abandoned homes\n\n00:04:47.444 --> 00:04:49.691\nfrom where they sit on their porches.\n\n00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:54.030\nCitywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.\n\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.045\nThey can also see vacant property.\n\n00:04:57.045 --> 00:04:58.902\nThey're beginning to see illegal activities\n\n00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:01.126\non these properties, like illegal dumping,\n\n00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:05.431\nand they know that because the city\nhas lost so much population,\n\n00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:10.598\ntheir costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,\n\n00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:13.430\nbecause there are not enough people\nto pay property taxes\n\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.774\nto help support the services that they need.\n\n00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:21.027\nCitywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.\n\n00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:23.025\nNow, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,\n\n00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:24.375\nbecause I know that sounds like a big number,\n\n00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:26.913\nbut I don't think you quite understand\nuntil you look at the city map.\n\n00:05:26.913 --> 00:05:29.619\nSo the city is 139 square miles.\n\n00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.665\nYou can fit Boston, San Francisco,\n\n00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.225\nand the island of Manhattan\n\n00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:34.901\nwithin its footprint.\n\n00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.291\nSo if we take all of that vacant\nand abandoned property\n\n00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:39.487\nand we smush it together,\n\n00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:41.323\nit looks like about 20 square miles,\n\n00:05:41.323 --> 00:05:43.291\nand that's roughly equivalent to the size\n\n00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:44.998\nof the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,\n\n00:05:44.998 --> 00:05:46.448\nat 22 square miles.\n\n00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:50.048\nSo it's a lot of vacancy.\n\n00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:52.224\nNow some of our audience members\n\n00:05:52.224 --> 00:05:54.342\nalso tell us about some of the positive things\n\n00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:56.387\nthat are happening in their communities,\n\n00:05:56.387 --> 00:05:57.974\nand many of them are banding together\n\n00:05:57.974 --> 00:06:00.080\nto take control of some of the vacant lots,\n\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.949\nand they're starting community gardens,\n\n00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.624\nwhich are creating a great sense\nof community stewardship,\n\n00:06:04.624 --> 00:06:06.619\nbut they're very, very clear to tell us\n\n00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:08.410\nthat this is not enough,\n\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.916\nthat they want to see their neighborhoods\n\n00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:13.269\nreturn to the way that their\ngrandparents had found them.\n\n00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:15.712\nNow there's been a lot of speculation since 2010\n\n00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:18.388\nabout what to do with the vacant property,\n\n00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:21.108\nand a lot of that speculation has\nbeen around community gardening,\n\n00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:23.340\nor what we call urban agriculture.\n\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.918\nSo many people would say to us,\n\n00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:27.626\n\"What if you just take all that vacant land\nand you could make it farmland?\n\n00:06:27.626 --> 00:06:29.729\nIt can provide fresh foods,\n\n00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.434\nand it can put Detroiters back to work too.\"\n\n00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.879\nWhen I hear that story,\n\n00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.495\nI always imagine the folks from the Great Migration\n\n00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.749\nrolling over in their graves,\n\n00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.066\nbecause you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice\n\n00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:44.143\nmoving from the South to the North\n\n00:06:44.143 --> 00:06:46.255\nto create a better life for their families,\n\n00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:50.501\nonly to see their great-grandchildren\nreturn to an agrarian lifestyle,\n\n00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:52.709\nespecially in a city where they came\n\n00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.763\nwith little less than a high school education\n\n00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:56.730\nor even a grammar school education\n\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.755\nand were able to afford the basic elements\n\n00:06:58.755 --> 00:07:00.044\nof the American dream:\n\n00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:04.079\nsteady work and a home that they owned.\n\n00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:06.310\nNow, there's a third wave of migration\n\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.870\nhappening in Detroit:\n\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.014\na new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.\n\n00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.430\nThese folks see that same vacant land\n\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.925\nand those same abandoned homes\n\n00:07:14.925 --> 00:07:16.320\nas opportunity for new,\n\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.991\nentrepreneurial ideas and profit,\n\n00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:20.978\nso much so that former models\n\n00:07:20.978 --> 00:07:22.399\ncan move to Detroit,\n\n00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:24.720\nbuy property, start successful\n\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.397\nbusinesses and restaurants,\n\n00:07:26.397 --> 00:07:29.377\nand become successful community\nactivists in their neighborhood,\n\n00:07:29.377 --> 00:07:32.399\nbringing about very positive change.\n\n00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:35.303\nSimilarly, we have small manufacturing companies\n\n00:07:35.303 --> 00:07:38.572\nmaking conscious decisions to relocate to the city.\n\n00:07:38.572 --> 00:07:41.357\nThis company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch\n\n00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:43.069\nand bicycle company,\n\n00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:44.962\ndeliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,\n\n00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:47.599\nand they quote themselves by saying\n\n00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:51.857\nthey were drawn to the global brand \nof Detroit's innovation.\n\n00:07:51.857 --> 00:07:54.429\nAnd they also knew that \nthey can tap into a workforce\n\n00:07:54.429 --> 00:07:57.955\nthat was still very skilled in how to make things.\n\n00:07:57.955 --> 00:08:00.524\nNow we have community stewardship\n\n\n00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:02.084\nhappening in neighborhoods,\n\n00:08:02.084 --> 00:08:04.883\nwe have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions\n\n00:08:04.883 --> 00:08:07.931\nto move to the city and create enterprises,\n\n00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:09.666\nand we have businesses relocating,\n\n00:08:09.666 --> 00:08:11.052\nand this is all in the context\n\n00:08:11.052 --> 00:08:13.324\nof what is no secret to us all,\n\n00:08:13.324 --> 00:08:15.125\na city that's under the control\n\n00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:16.747\nof an emergency manager,\n\n00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:21.021\nand just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.\n\n00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:24.263\nSo 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,\n\n00:08:24.263 --> 00:08:26.347\nwe released Detroit Future City,\n\n00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:29.185\nwhich was our strategic plan to guide the city\n\n00:08:29.185 --> 00:08:31.004\ninto a better and more prosperous\n\n00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:33.281\nand more sustainable existence --\n\n00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:36.946\nnot what it was, but what it could be,\n\n00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:40.261\nlooking at new ways of economic growth,\n\n00:08:40.261 --> 00:08:42.242\nnew forms of land use,\n\n00:08:42.242 --> 00:08:45.350\nmore sustainable and denser neighborhoods,\n\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.766\na reconfigured infrastructure\nand city service system,\n\n00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:51.634\nand a heightened capacity for civic leaders\n\n00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:54.896\nto take action and implement change.\n\n00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:57.494\nThree key imperatives were really important\n\n00:08:57.494 --> 00:08:58.775\nto our work.\n\n00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:02.653\nOne was that the city itself\nwasn't necessarily too large,\n\n00:09:02.653 --> 00:09:04.341\nbut the economy was too small.\n\n00:09:04.341 --> 00:09:07.601\nThere are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,\n\n00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:10.999\nvery different from a Denver\nor an Atlanta or a Philadelphia\n\n00:09:10.999 --> 00:09:15.919\nthat are anywhere between \n35 to 70 jobs per 100 people.\n\n00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.341\nSecondly, there had to be an acceptance\n\n00:09:18.341 --> 00:09:20.297\nthat we were not going to be able to use\n\n00:09:20.297 --> 00:09:23.161\nall of this vacant land in the way that we had before\n\n00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:25.170\nand maybe for some time to come.\n\n00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.735\nIt wasn't going to be our traditional\nresidential neighborhoods\n\n00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:29.352\nas we had before,\n\n00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:32.110\nand urban agriculture, while a very productive\n\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.802\nand successful intervention happening in Detroit,\n\n00:09:34.802 --> 00:09:36.905\nwas not the only answer,\n\n00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:39.341\nthat what we had to do is look at these areas\n\n00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:41.149\nwhere we had significant vacancy\n\n00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:44.384\nbut still had a significant number of population\n\n00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:47.282\nof what could be new, productive, innovative,\n\n00:09:47.282 --> 00:09:48.816\nand entrepreneurial uses\n\n00:09:48.816 --> 00:09:50.771\nthat could stabilize those communities,\n\n00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:54.139\nwhere still nearly 300,000 residents lived.\n\n00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:56.955\nSo we came up with one neighborhood typology --\n\n00:09:56.955 --> 00:09:59.928\nthere are several --\ncalled a live-make neighborhood,\n\n00:09:59.928 --> 00:10:01.887\nwhere folks could reappropriate\n\n00:10:01.887 --> 00:10:03.625\nabandoned structures\n\n00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:05.915\nand turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,\n\n00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:08.998\nwith a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,\n\n00:10:08.998 --> 00:10:12.183\nmajority 82 percent African-American population.\n\n00:10:12.183 --> 00:10:14.284\nSo they, too, could take businesses\n\n00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:16.683\nthat they maybe were doing out of their home\n\n00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:19.394\nand grow them to more prosperous industries\n\n00:10:19.394 --> 00:10:22.104\nand actually acquire property so they were actually\n\n00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:24.553\nproperty owners as well as business owners\n\n00:10:24.553 --> 00:10:27.079\nin the communities with which they resided.\n\n00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:29.157\nThen we also wanted to look at other ways\n\n00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:32.491\nof using land in addition to growing food\n\n00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:34.315\nand transforming landscape into\n\n00:10:34.315 --> 00:10:36.175\nmuch more productive uses,\n\n00:10:36.175 --> 00:10:39.465\nso that it could be used for storm\nwater management, for example,\n\n00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:42.481\nby using surface lakes and retention ponds,\n\n00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:44.241\nthat created neighborhood amenities,\n\n00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:45.933\nplaces of recreation,\n\n00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:47.750\nand actually helped to elevate\n\n00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.437\nadjacent property levels.\n\n00:10:49.437 --> 00:10:51.297\nOr we could use it as research plots,\n\n00:10:51.297 --> 00:10:54.605\nwhere we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,\n\n00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:58.571\nor we could use it to generate energy.\n\n00:10:58.571 --> 00:11:01.769\nSo the descendants of the Great Migration\n\n00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:05.013\ncould either become precision\nwatchmakers at Shinola,\n\n00:11:05.013 --> 00:11:08.324\nlike Willie H., who was featured\nin one of their ads last year,\n\n00:11:08.324 --> 00:11:10.716\nor they can actually grow a business\n\n00:11:10.716 --> 00:11:13.441\nthat would service companies like Shinola.\n\n00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:15.443\nThe good news is, there is a future\n\n00:11:15.443 --> 00:11:18.002\nfor the next generation of Detroiters,\n\n00:11:18.002 --> 00:11:21.166\nboth those there now and those that want to come.\n\n00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:23.297\nSo no thank you, Mayor Menino,\n\n00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:24.940\nwho recently was quoted as saying,\n\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.555\n\"I'd blow up the place and start over.\"\n\n00:11:27.555 --> 00:11:29.906\nThere are very important people,\n\n00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:32.307\nbusiness and land assets in Detroit,\n\n00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:34.103\nand there are real opportunities there.\n\n00:11:34.103 --> 00:11:36.726\nSo while Detroit might not be what it was,\n\n00:11:36.726 --> 00:11:38.345\nDetroit will not die.\n\n00:11:38.345 --> 00:11:40.368\nThank you.\n\n00:11:40.368 --> 00:11:43.796\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Welcome to the age of the industrial internet", "duration": "756", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marco_annunziata_welcome_to_the_age_of_the_industrial_internet", "transcript": "Einstein said that \"I never think about the future \u2014 it comes soon enough.\"And he was right, of course. So today, I'm here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now. Over the past 200 years, the world has experienced two major waves of innovation. First, the Industrial Revolution brought us machines and factories, railways, electricity, air travel, and our lives have never been the same. Then the Internet revolution brought us computing power, data networks, unprecedented access to information and communication, and our lives have never been the same.Now we are experiencing another metamorphic change: the industrial Internet. It brings together intelligent machines, advanced analytics, and the creativity of people at work. It's the marriage of minds and machines. And our lives will never be the same.In my current role, I see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our economy and in our lives: energy, aviation, transportation, health care. For an economist, this is highly unusual, and it's extremely exciting, because this is a transformation as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more, and before the Industrial Revolution, there was no economic growth to speak of.So what is this industrial Internet? Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see, hear, feel a lot more than ever before, generating prodigious amounts of data. Increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data, providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways, a lot more efficiently. And not just individual machines, but fleets of locomotives, airplanes, entire systems like power grids, hospitals. It is asset optimization and system optimization. Of course, electronic sensors have been around for some time, but something has changed: a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and, thanks to advances in cloud computing, a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data.So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent; they are brilliant. They are self-aware, they are predictive, reactive and social. It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines, medical devices, communicating seamlessly with each other and with us. It's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it. We are beginning to deploy throughout the industrial system embedded virtualization, multi-core processor technology, advanced cloud-based communications, a new software-defined machine infrastructure which allows machine functionality to become virtualized in software, decoupling machine software from hardware, and allowing us to remotely and automatically monitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.Why does any of this matter at all? Well first of all, it's already allowing us to shift towards preventive, condition-based maintenance, which means fixing machines just before they break, without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule. And this, in turn, is pushing us towards zero unplanned downtime, which means there will be no more power outages, no more flight delays.So let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work, and some of the examples may seem trivial, some are clearly more profound, but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact.Let's start with aviation. Today, 10 percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events. Something goes wrong unexpectedly. This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year, not to mention the impact on all of us: stress, inconvenience, missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal. So how can the industrial Internet help here? We've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft. It's self-learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss. The aircraft, while in flight, will communicate with technicians on the ground. By the time it lands, they will already know if anything needs to be serviced. Just in the U.S., a system like this can prevent over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year, helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time.Or take healthcare. Today, nurses spend an average of 21 minutes per shift looking for medical equipment. That seems trivial, but it's less time spent caring for patients. St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas, which has deployed industrial Internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients, staff and medical equipment, has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour. If you need surgery, one hour matters. It means more patients can be treated, more lives can be saved. Another medical center, in Washington state, is piloting an application that allows medical images from city scanners and MRIs to be analyzed in the cloud, developing better analytics at a lower cost. Imagine a patient who has suffered a severe trauma, and needs the attention of several specialists: a neurologist, a cardiologist, an orthopedic surgeon. If all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken, they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster. So all of this translates into better health outcomes, but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits. Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide, and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis.Similar advances are happening in energy, including renewable energy. Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way, depending on how the wind is blowing, can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour. Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents, six times as much.The list goes on, and it will grow fast, because industrial data are now growing exponentially. By 2020, they will account for over 50 percent of all digital information.But this is not just about data, so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the jobs we do every day, because this new wave of innovation is bringing about new tools and applications that will allow us to collaborate in a smarter and faster way, making our jobs not just more efficient but more rewarding. Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing. She already has all the spare parts, because the problems were diagnosed in advanced. And if she faces an unexpected issue, the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center, let them see what she sees, transmit data that they can run through diagnostics, and they can stream videos that will guide her, step by step, through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running. And their interaction gets documented and stored in a searchable database.Let's stop and think about this for a minute, because this is a very important point. This new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work. And I know that many of you will be concerned  about the impact that innovation might have on jobs. Unemployment is already high, and there is always a fear  that innovation will destroy jobs. And innovation is disruptive. But let me stress two things here. First, we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture, automation of industry, and employment has gone up, because innovation is fundamentally about growth. It makes products more affordable. It creates new demand, new jobs. Second, there is a concern that in the future, there will only be room for engineers, data scientists, and other highly-specialized workers. And believe me, as an economist, I am also scared. But think about it: Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad, so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man than the Charlie Chaplin of \"Modern Times.\" And to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created: mechanical digital engineers who understand both the machines and the data; managers who understand their industry and the analytics and can reorganize the business to take full advantage of the technology.But now let's take a step back. Let's look at the big picture. There are people who argue that today's innovation is all about social media and silly games, with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution. They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations are behind us. And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that even back in the Stone Age, there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy, and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill, and saying to each other, \"Yeah, this wheel thing, cool toy, sure, but compared to fire, it will have no impact. The big discoveries are all behind us.\" (Laughter)This technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen. Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward. They've created jobs. They've raised living standards. They've made our lives healthier and more rewarding. And the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different. In the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent over the next 15 years, boosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time, and adding between 10 and 15 trillion dollars to global GDP. That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.But this is not a foregone conclusion. We are just at the beginning of this transformation, and there will be barriers to break, obstacles to overcome. We will need to invest in the new technologies. We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices. We will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. And the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills. It's not going to be easy, but it is going to be worth it. The economic challenges facing us are hard, but when I walk the factory floor, and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected, and I see the difference this makes in a hospital, in an airport, in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic, I'm enthusiastic. This new technological revolution is upon us.So think about the future \u2014 it will be here soon enough.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1893, "subtitle":

software-defined machine infrastructure\n\n00:03:22.892 --> 00:03:25.636\nwhich allows machine functionality\n\n00:03:25.636 --> 00:03:28.210\nto become virtualized in software,\n\n00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.372\ndecoupling machine software from hardware,\n\n00:03:31.372 --> 00:03:34.979\nand allowing us to remotely and automatically\n\n00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:40.303\nmonitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.\n\n00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.437\nWhy does any of this matter at all?\n\n00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:45.908\nWell first of all, it's already allowing us\n\n00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:48.109\nto shift towards preventive,\n\n00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.987\ncondition-based maintenance,\n\n00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:51.949\nwhich means fixing machines\n\n00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.237\njust before they break,\n\n00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:56.253\nwithout wasting time\n\n00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:58.581\nservicing them on a fixed schedule.\n\n00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:02.218\nAnd this, in turn, is pushing us towards\n\n00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:04.073\nzero unplanned downtime,\n\n00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:06.938\nwhich means there will be no more power outages,\n\n00:04:06.938 --> 00:04:08.978\nno more flight delays.\n\n00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:10.622\nSo let me give you a few examples\n\n00:04:10.622 --> 00:04:12.501\nof how these brilliant machines work,\n\n00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:14.799\nand some of the examples may seem trivial,\n\n00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.795\nsome are clearly more profound,\n\n00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:20.920\nbut all of them are going to\nhave a very powerful impact.\n\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.874\nLet's start with aviation.\n\n00:04:22.874 --> 00:04:25.142\nToday, 10 percent of all flights\n\n00:04:25.142 --> 00:04:27.260\ncancellations and delays\n\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.961\nare due to unscheduled maintenance events.\n\n00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:31.993\nSomething goes wrong unexpectedly.\n\n00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:35.189\nThis results in eight billion dollars in costs\n\n00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.601\nfor the airline industry globally every year,\n\n00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:39.903\nnot to mention the impact on all of us:\n\n00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:41.988\nstress, inconvenience,\n\n00:04:41.988 --> 00:04:44.883\nmissed meetings as we sit helplessly\n\n00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:46.792\nin an airport terminal.\n\n00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:50.210\nSo how can the industrial Internet help here?\n\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.845\nWe've developed a preventive maintenance system\n\n00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:54.835\nwhich can be installed on any aircraft.\n\n00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:58.086\nIt's self-learning and able to predict issues\n\n00:04:58.086 --> 00:05:01.042\nthat a human operator would miss.\n\n00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:03.396\nThe aircraft, while in flight,\n\n00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:05.746\nwill communicate with technicians on the ground.\n\n00:05:05.746 --> 00:05:07.706\nBy the time it lands, they will already know\n\n00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.192\nif anything needs to be serviced.\n\n00:05:10.192 --> 00:05:13.808\nJust in the U.S., a system like this can prevent\n\n00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:17.515\nover 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,\n\n00:05:17.515 --> 00:05:19.477\nhelping seven million passengers\n\n00:05:19.477 --> 00:05:22.013\nget to their destinations on time.\n\n00:05:22.013 --> 00:05:23.666\nOr take healthcare.\n\n00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:25.397\nToday, nurses spend an average\n\n00:05:25.397 --> 00:05:28.040\nof 21 minutes per shift\n\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.733\nlooking for medical equipment.\n\n00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:34.116\nThat seems trivial, but it's less time spent\n\n00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:36.825\ncaring for patients.\n\n00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:39.699\nSt. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,\n\n00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.626\nwhich has deployed industrial Internet technology\n\n00:05:42.626 --> 00:05:44.691\nto electronically monitor and connect\n\n00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:47.890\npatients, staff and medical equipment,\n\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.200\nhas reduced bed turnaround times\n\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.935\nby nearly one hour.\n\n00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.745\nIf you need surgery, one hour matters.\n\n00:05:54.745 --> 00:05:57.072\nIt means more patients can be treated,\n\n00:05:57.072 --> 00:05:59.062\nmore lives can be saved.\n\n00:05:59.062 --> 00:06:02.026\nAnother medical center, in Washington state,\n\n00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:03.914\nis piloting an application that allows\n\n00:06:03.914 --> 00:06:07.007\nmedical images from city scanners and MRIs\n\n00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:09.122\nto be analyzed in the cloud,\n\n00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:11.759\ndeveloping better analytics\n\n00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.320\nat a lower cost.\n\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.944\nImagine a patient\n\n00:06:15.944 --> 00:06:17.378\nwho has suffered a severe trauma,\n\n00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:20.133\nand needs the attention of several specialists:\n\n00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:21.942\na neurologist, a cardiologist,\n\n00:06:21.942 --> 00:06:23.553\nan orthopedic surgeon.\n\n00:06:23.553 --> 00:06:26.879\nIf all of them can have instantaneous\nand simultaneous access\n\n00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.665\nto scans and images as they are taken,\n\n00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:34.362\nthey will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.\n\n00:06:34.363 --> 00:06:37.441\nSo all of this translates into better health outcomes,\n\n00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:40.881\nbut it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.\n\n00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:44.367\nJust a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies\n\n00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:47.873\ncould yield savings of over 60 billion dollars\n\n00:06:47.873 --> 00:06:50.670\nto the healthcare industry worldwide,\n\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.029\nand that is just a drop in the sea\n\n00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.765\ncompared to what we need to do to make healthcare\n\n00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:58.186\naffordable on a sustainable basis.\n\n00:06:58.186 --> 00:07:00.444\nSimilar advances are happening in energy,\n\n00:07:00.444 --> 00:07:02.914\nincluding renewable energy.\n\n00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:07.617\nWind farms equipped with new\nremote monitorings and diagnostics\n\n00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:10.212\nthat allow wind turbines to talk to each other\n\n00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:14.061\nand adjust the pitch of their\nblades in a coordinated way,\n\n00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.180\ndepending on how the wind is blowing,\n\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.156\ncan now produce electricity at a cost\n\n00:07:18.156 --> 00:07:21.334\nof less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.\n\n00:07:21.334 --> 00:07:23.351\nTen years ago, that cost was 30 cents,\n\n00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:25.303\nsix times as much.\n\n00:07:25.303 --> 00:07:28.207\nThe list goes on, and it will grow fast,\n\n00:07:28.207 --> 00:07:30.908\nbecause industrial data are\nnow growing exponentially.\n\n00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:33.760\nBy 2020, they will account for over 50 percent\n\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.988\nof all digital information.\n\n00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:39.167\nBut this is not just about data, so let me switch gears\n\n00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.008\nand tell you how this is impacting already\n\n00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:43.451\nthe jobs we do every day,\n\n00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:45.172\nbecause this new wave of innovation\n\n00:07:45.172 --> 00:07:48.288\nis bringing about new tools and applications\n\n00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:50.804\nthat will allow us to collaborate\n\n00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.374\nin a smarter and faster way,\n\n00:07:52.374 --> 00:07:55.507\nmaking our jobs not just more efficient\n\n00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:57.296\nbut more rewarding.\n\n00:07:57.296 --> 00:08:00.200\nImagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm\n\n00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.886\nwith a handheld device telling her\n\n00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:04.184\nwhich turbines need servicing.\n\n00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:05.662\nShe already has all the spare parts,\n\n00:08:05.662 --> 00:08:08.204\nbecause the problems were diagnosed in advanced.\n\n00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:10.678\nAnd if she faces an unexpected issue,\n\n00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:13.281\nthe same handheld device will allow her to\n\n00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:15.789\ncommunicate with colleagues at the service center,\n\n00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:17.889\nlet them see what she sees,\n\n00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:20.644\ntransmit data that they can run through diagnostics,\n\n00:08:20.644 --> 00:08:22.941\nand they can stream videos that will guide her,\n\n00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:25.309\nstep by step, through whatever complex procedure\n\n00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:27.771\nis needed to get the machines back up and running.\n\n00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.787\nAnd their interaction gets documented\n\n00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:34.189\nand stored in a searchable database.\n\n00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:35.959\nLet's stop and think about this for a minute,\n\n00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:37.680\nbecause this is a very important point.\n\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.906\nThis new wave of innovation is fundamentally\n\n00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:42.376\nchanging the way we work.\n\n00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:47.585\nAnd I know that many of you will be concerned \nabout the impact that innovation might have on jobs.\n\n00:08:47.585 --> 00:08:49.082\nUnemployment is already high,\n\n00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:52.318\nand there is always a fear \nthat innovation will destroy jobs.\n\n00:08:52.318 --> 00:08:54.449\nAnd innovation is disruptive.\n\n00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:56.902\nBut let me stress two things here.\n\n00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:58.833\nFirst, we've already lived through\n\n00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:01.596\nmechanization of agriculture,\nautomation of industry,\n\n00:09:01.596 --> 00:09:03.621\nand employment has gone up,\n\n00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:05.914\nbecause innovation is fundamentally about growth.\n\n00:09:05.914 --> 00:09:07.807\nIt makes products more affordable.\n\n00:09:07.807 --> 00:09:10.467\nIt creates new demand, new jobs.\n\n00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.049\nSecond, there is a concern that in the future,\n\n00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:15.205\nthere will only be room for engineers,\n\n00:09:15.205 --> 00:09:18.225\ndata scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.\n\n00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:21.794\nAnd believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.\n\n00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.513\nBut think about it:\n\n00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:26.132\nJust as a child can easily figure out\n\n00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.888\nhow to operate an iPad,\n\n00:09:27.888 --> 00:09:30.013\nso a new generation of mobile and intuitive\n\n00:09:30.013 --> 00:09:32.737\nindustrial applications will make life easier\n\n00:09:32.737 --> 00:09:35.156\nfor workers of all skill levels.\n\n00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:38.358\nThe worker of the future will be more like Iron Man\n\n00:09:38.358 --> 00:09:41.484\nthan the Charlie Chaplin of \"Modern Times.\"\n\n00:09:41.484 --> 00:09:44.528\nAnd to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:\n\n00:09:44.528 --> 00:09:46.404\nmechanical digital engineers who understand\n\n00:09:46.404 --> 00:09:48.536\nboth the machines and the data;\n\n00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:50.819\nmanagers who understand their industry\n\n00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:53.680\nand the analytics and can reorganize the business\n\n00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.802\nto take full advantage of the technology.\n\n00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:59.118\nBut now let's take a step back.\n\n00:09:59.118 --> 00:10:01.162\nLet's look at the big picture.\n\n00:10:01.162 --> 00:10:03.585\nThere are people who argue that today's innovation\n\n00:10:03.585 --> 00:10:05.934\nis all about social media and silly games,\n\n00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:07.824\nwith nowhere near the transformational power\n\n00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:09.903\nof the Industrial Revolution.\n\n00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:12.658\nThey say that all the growth-enhancing innovations\n\n00:10:12.658 --> 00:10:14.084\nare behind us.\n\n00:10:14.084 --> 00:10:17.398\nAnd every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that\n\n00:10:17.398 --> 00:10:19.366\neven back in the Stone Age,\n\n00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:21.655\nthere must have been a group of cavemen\n\n00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:23.534\nsitting around a fire one day\n\n00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:25.060\nlooking very grumpy,\n\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.786\nand looking disapprovingly\nat another group of cavemen\n\n00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:29.955\nrolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,\n\n00:10:29.955 --> 00:10:31.764\nand saying to each other,\n\n00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:34.045\n\"Yeah, this wheel thing,\n\n00:10:34.045 --> 00:10:36.836\ncool toy, sure, but compared to fire,\n\n00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.952\nit will have no impact.\n\n00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:41.276\nThe big discoveries are all behind us.\"\n\n00:10:41.276 --> 00:10:43.163\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:44.711\nThis technological revolution\n\n00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:47.239\nis as inspiring and transformational\n\n00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:49.252\nas anything we have ever seen.\n\n00:10:49.252 --> 00:10:52.642\nHuman creativity and innovation\nhave always propelled us forward.\n\n00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:54.089\nThey've created jobs.\n\n00:10:54.089 --> 00:10:55.478\nThey've raised living standards.\n\n00:10:55.478 --> 00:10:57.281\nThey've made our lives\n\n00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:59.341\nhealthier and more rewarding.\n\n00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:00.584\nAnd the new wave of innovation\n\n00:11:00.584 --> 00:11:02.934\nwhich is beginning to sweep through industry\n\n00:11:02.934 --> 00:11:04.556\nis no different.\n\n00:11:04.556 --> 00:11:06.572\nIn the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet\n\n00:11:06.572 --> 00:11:10.512\ncould raise average income by 25 to 40 percent\n\n00:11:10.512 --> 00:11:12.204\nover the next 15 years,\n\n00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:14.873\nboosting growth to rates we\nhaven't seen in a long time,\n\n00:11:14.873 --> 00:11:18.817\nand adding between 10 and 15\ntrillion dollars to global GDP.\n\n00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:23.070\nThat is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.\n\n00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.581\nBut this is not a foregone conclusion.\n\n00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:27.576\nWe are just at the beginning of this transformation,\n\n00:11:27.576 -->

Finished knowing \u2014 then \u2014\"We know depression through metaphors. Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language, Goya in an image. Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states.As for me, I had always thought myself tough, one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp.In 1991, I had a series of losses. My mother died, a relationship I'd been in ended, I moved back to the United States from some years abroad, and I got through all of those experiences intact.But in 1994, three years later, I found myself losing interest in almost everything. I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do, and I didn't know why. The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine, and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends, I would think, \"What a lot of people that is to have to call back.\" Or I would decide I should have lunch, and then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it, and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous. You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal, and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity.And then the anxiety set in. If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month, I would say, \"As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it.\" But if you said to me, \"You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,\" I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you, but instead of lasting half a second, the way that does, it lasted for six months. It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of. And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people.And finally one day, I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke, because I lay in bed completely frozen, looking at the telephone, thinking, \"Something is wrong and I should call for help,\" and I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it, the phone rang, and somehow I managed to pick it up, and it was my father, and I said, \"I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something.\"The next day I started with the medications and the therapy. And I also started reckoning with this terrible question: If I'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp, then who am I? And if I have to take medication, is that medication making me more fully myself, or is it making me someone else? And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else?I had two advantages as I went into the fight. The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking, I had a nice life, and that if I could only get well, there was something at the other end that was worth living for. And the other was that I had access to good treatment.But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. And I thought, \"But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem? And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?\" And I couldn't figure out which it was. And then I understood that actually, we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully. The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play, and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality.I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling. They're not very effective. They're extremely costly. They come with innumerable side effects. They're a disaster. But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago, when there would have been almost nothing to be done. I hope that 50 years hence, people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science.Depression is the flaw in love. If you were married to someone and thought, \"Well, if my wife dies, I'll find another one,\" it wouldn't be love as we know it. There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss, and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy.There are three things people tend to confuse: depression, grief and sadness. Grief is explicitly reactive. If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy, and then, six months later, you are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better, it's probably grief, and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. If you experience a catastrophic loss, and you feel terrible, and six months later you can barely function at all, then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. The trajectory tells us a great deal. People think of depression as being just sadness. It's much, much too much sadness, much too much grief at far too slight a cause.As I set out to understand depression, and to interview people who had experienced it, I found that there were people who seemed, on the surface, to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it. And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes. And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people. What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive? And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression.One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead, and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness, that this is a serious business. It's the leading disability worldwide, and people die of it every day.One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years, and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college, and then plummeted into a horrific depression. She had bipolar illness, or manic depression, as it was then known. And then she did very well for many years on lithium, and then eventually, she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it, and she had another psychosis, and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents' apartment, more or less catatonic, essentially without moving, day after day after day. And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later \u2014 she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins \u2014 when I interviewed her, she said, \"I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,' over and over, to occupy my mind. I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying, which were, 'You are nothing. You are nobody. You don't even deserve to live.' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself.\"You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives, because we believe we are seeing the truth.But the truth lies. I became obsessed with that sentence: \"But the truth lies.\" And I discovered, as I talked to depressive people, that they have many delusional perceptions. People will say, \"No one loves me.\" And you say, \"I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you.\" You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people. But people who are depressed will also say, \"No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end.\" Or they'll say, \"There can be no true communion between two human beings. Each of us is trapped in his own body.\" To which you have to say, \"That's true, but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast.\"(Laughter)A lot of the time, what they are expressing is not illness, but insight, and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much. There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour, and at the end of the hour, they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed. The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent, and the non-depressed people guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters \u2014(Laughter)as they had actually killed.A lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression, that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet, to have people know. They said, \"Do people talk to you differently?\" I said, \"Yes, people talk to me differently. They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience, or their sister's experience, or their friend's experience. Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has.I went a few years ago to a conference, and on Friday of the three-day conference, one of the participants took me aside, and she said, \"I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it, but I've been taking this medication, and I just wanted to ask you what you think?\" And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could. And then she said, \"You know, my husband would never understand this. He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense, so, you know, it's just between us.\" And I said, \"Yes, that's fine.\" On Sunday of the same conference, her husband took me aside,(Laughter)and he said, \"My wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this, but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication, and I wondered what you think?\" They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom.(Laughter)And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems.(Laughter)But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. Depression is so exhausting. It takes up so much of your time and energy, and silence about it, it really does make the depression worse.And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better. I'd started off as a medical conservative. I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked, it was clear what they were \u2014 there was medication, there were certain psychotherapies, there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment, and that everything else was nonsense. But then I discovered something. If you have brain cancer, and you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer, and you'll still probably die from it. But if you say that you have depression, and standing on your head for 20 minutes every day makes you feel better, then it's worked, because depression is an illness of how you feel, and if you feel better, then you are effectively not depressed anymore. So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments.And I get letters, I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them. Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation. My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy, medication, she had tried pretty much everything, and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world, and that was making little things from yarn.(Laughter)She sent me some of them.(Laughter)And I'm not wearing them right now.(Laughter)I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.And yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments, I also gained perspective on other treatments. I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram's blood and that I'm not going to detail right now, but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda, working on a different project, and I happened to describe my experience to someone, and he said, \"Well, that's West Africa, and we're in East Africa, and our rituals are in some ways very different, but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you're describing.\" And he said, \"But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers, especially the ones who came right after the genocide.\" I said, \"What kind of trouble did you have?\" And he said, \"Well, they would do this bizarre thing. They didn't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better. They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going. They didn't involve the whole community. They didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit. Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them.\"(Laughter)(Applause)He said, \"We had to ask them to leave the country.\"(Laughter)Now at the other end of alternative treatments, let me tell you about Frank Russakoff. Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man. He was constantly depressed. He was, when I met him, at a point at which every month, he would have electroshock treatment. Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week. Then he would feel okay for a week. Then he would have a week of going downhill. And then he would have another electroshock treatment. And he said to me when I met him, \"It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way. I can't go on this way, and I've figured out how I'm going to end it if I don't get better.\" \"But,\" he said to me, \"I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery, and I think I'm going to give that a try.\" And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism to reach out for one more. And he had the cingulotomy, and it was incredibly successful.He's now a friend of mine. He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children. He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery, and he said, \"My father sent me two presents this year, First, a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didn't really need, but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love. And the other present was a photo of my grandmother, who committed suicide. As I unwrapped it, I began to cry, and my mother came over and said, 'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?' And I said, 'She had the same disease I have.' I'm crying now as I write to you. It's not that I'm so sad, but I get overwhelmed, I think, because I could have killed myself, but my parents kept me going, and so did the doctors, and I had the surgery. I'm alive and grateful. We live in the right time, even if it doesn't always feel like it.\"I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing, and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts, and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent. And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression. And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression. Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability, which is presumably evenly distributed in the population, and triggering circumstances, which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished. And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time, you think, \"Why do I feel like this? I must have depression.\" And you set out to find treatment for it. But if you have a perfectly awful life, and you feel miserable all the time, the way you feel is commensurate with your life, and it doesn't occur to you to think, \"Maybe this is treatable.\"And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that's not being picked up and that's not being treated and that's not being addressed, and it's a tragedy of a grand order. And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C., where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression, and then provided six months of the experimental protocol. One of them, Lolly, came in, and this is what she said the day she came in. She said, and she was a woman, by the way, who had seven children. She said, \"I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn't go out of the house. I have nothing to say to my children. In the morning, I can't wait for them to leave, and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head, and three o'clock when they come home, it just comes so fast.\" She said, \"I've been taking a lot of Tylenol, anything I can take so that I can sleep more. My husband has been telling me I'm stupid, I'm ugly. I wish I could stop the pain.\"Well, she was brought into this experimental protocol, and when I interviewed her six months later, she had taken a job working in childcare for the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband, and she said to me, \"My kids are so much happier now.\" She said, \"There's one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls, but at night, they're just all up on my bed, and we're doing homework all together and everything. One of them wants to be a preacher, one of them wants to be a firefighter, and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer. They don't cry like they used to, and they don't fight like they did. That's all I need now, is my kids. Things keep on changing, the way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act. I can go outside not being afraid anymore, and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back, and if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that, I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head, if I were still alive at all. I asked the Lord to send me an angel, and He heard my prayers.\"I was really moved by these experiences, and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on, but also in an article, and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent.And I turned in my story, and my editor called me and said, \"We really can't publish this.\"And I said, \"Why not?\"And she said, \"It just is too far-fetched. These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley? It's just too implausible.\" She said, \"I've never even heard of anything like it.\"And I said, \"The fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news.\"(Laughter)(Applause)\"And you are a news magazine.\"So after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it. But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment, the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities, that would be exploitative, because we would be changing them. There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us, that treatment of depression, the medications and so on, are an artifice, and that it's not natural. And I think that's very misguided. It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out, but there is nobody militating against toothpaste, at least not in my circles.People then say, \"But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience? Didn't we evolve to have depression? Isn't it part of your personality?\" To which I would say, mood is adaptive. Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have, that's incredibly valuable. And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken. It's maladaptive.People will come to me and say, \"I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year, I think I can just get through this.\"And I always say to them, \"You may get through it, but you'll never be 37 again. Life is short, and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up. Think it through.\"It's a strange poverty of the English language, and indeed of many other languages, that we use this same word, depression, to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday, and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide.People say to me, \"Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?\" And I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity, but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting, and what happens if you leave the house for 100 years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. And it's that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that's the one we're setting out to address.So now people say, \"You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?\" And I don't. But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don't feel sad about my answering machine, and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. I feel more, in fact, I think, because I can feel sadness without nullity. I feel sad about professional disappointments, about damaged relationships, about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion? How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through? What is the mechanism of resilience?And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience, and say, \"I was depressed a long time ago, I never want to think about it again, I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life,\" ironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it, it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience.So Frank Russakoff said to me, \"If I had a do-over, I suppose I wouldn't do it this way, but in a strange way, I'm grateful for what I've experienced. I'm glad to have been in the hospital 40 times. It taught me so much about love, and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me, and will be always.\"And Maggie Robbins said, \"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic, and I would just talk and talk and talk, and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive, and I thought, 'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'\"(Laughter)\"And then I realized, I realized that they weren't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk. It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying, but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were. Our needs are our greatest assets. It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need.\"Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse, but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate. The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful. It's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again, \"This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it.\" I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts, and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and these days, my life is vital, even on the days when I'm sad. I felt that funeral in my brain, and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world, and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I've found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely, and sometimes against the moment's reason, to cleave to the reasons for living. And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1894, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:15.910 -->

plunge,\n\n00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:10.203\nand Finished knowing -- then --\"\n\n00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:14.970\nWe know depression through metaphors.\n\n00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:19.323\nEmily Dickinson was able\nto convey it in language,\n\n00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:21.662\nGoya in an image.\n\n00:01:22.196 --> 00:01:26.791\nHalf the purpose of art\nis to describe such iconic states.\n\n00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:31.809\nAs for me, I had always\nthought myself tough,\n\n00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:33.635\none of the people who could survive\n\n00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.982\nif I'd been sent to a concentration camp.\n\n00:01:36.572 --> 00:01:39.237\nIn 1991, I had a series of losses.\n\n00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:41.132\nMy mother died,\n\n00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.258\na relationship I'd been in ended,\n\n00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:47.202\nI moved back to the United States\nfrom some years abroad,\n\n00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:49.940\nand I got through all of those\nexperiences intact.\n\n00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:53.474\nBut in 1994, three years later,\n\n00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:57.240\nI found myself losing interest\nin almost everything.\n\n00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:01.893\nI didn't want to do any of the things\nI had previously wanted to do,\n\n00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:03.377\nand I didn't know why.\n\n00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:08.506\nThe opposite of depression\nis not happiness, but vitality.\n\n00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:10.529\nAnd it was vitality\n\n00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:13.516\nthat seemed to seep away\nfrom me in that moment.\n\n00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.866\nEverything there was to do\nseemed like too much work.\n\n00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.992\nI would come home\n\n00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:23.344\nand I would see the red light\nflashing on my answering machine,\n\n00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:25.908\nand instead of being thrilled\nto hear from my friends,\n\n00:02:25.932 --> 00:02:27.121\nI would think,\n\n00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:29.740\n\"What a lot of people that is\nto have to call back.\"\n\n00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:32.888\nOr I would decide I should have lunch,\n\n00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:35.649\nand then I would think,\nbut I'd have to get the food out\n\n00:02:35.673 --> 00:02:37.435\nand put it on a plate\n\n00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.323\nand cut it up and chew it and swallow it,\n\n00:02:41.347 --> 00:02:44.681\nand it felt to me\nlike the Stations of the Cross.\n\n00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:49.377\nAnd one of the things that often gets lost\nin discussions of depression\n\n00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:51.459\nis that you know it's ridiculous.\n\n00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.702\nYou know it's ridiculous\nwhile you're experiencing it.\n\n00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:56.615\nYou know that most people manage\n\n00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.929\nto listen to their messages and eat lunch\n\n00:02:58.953 --> 00:03:00.859\nand organize themselves to take a shower\n\n00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:02.101\nand go out the front door\n\n00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:03.753\nand that it's not a big deal,\n\n00:03:03.777 --> 00:03:06.919\nand yet you are nonetheless in its grip\n\n00:03:06.943 --> 00:03:10.380\nand you are unable to figure out\nany way around it.\n\n00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:15.170\nAnd so I began to feel myself doing less\n\n00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.480\nand thinking less\n\n00:03:17.504 --> 00:03:18.819\nand feeling less.\n\n00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:21.525\nIt was a kind of nullity.\n\n00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:24.002\nAnd then the anxiety set in.\n\n00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:28.217\nIf you told me that I'd have to be\ndepressed for the next month,\n\n00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.480\nI would say, \"As long I know it'll be over\nin November, I can do it.\"\n\n00:03:31.504 --> 00:03:32.750\nBut if you said to me,\n\n00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:36.087\n\"You have to have acute anxiety\nfor the next month,\"\n\n00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.430\nI would rather slit my wrist\nthan go through it.\n\n00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:40.012\nIt was the feeling all the time\n\n00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:42.240\nlike that feeling you have\nif you're walking\n\n00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:45.785\nand you slip or trip\nand the ground is rushing up at you,\n\n00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.521\nbut instead of lasting half a second,\nthe way that does,\n\n00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:50.426\nit lasted for six months.\n\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.379\nIt's a sensation\nof being afraid all the time\n\n00:03:53.403 --> 00:03:56.388\nbut not even knowing\nwhat it is that you're afraid of.\n\n00:03:57.015 --> 00:03:59.626\nAnd it was at that point\nthat I began to think\n\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.410\nthat it was just too painful to be alive,\n\n00:04:03.434 --> 00:04:05.994\nand that the only reason\nnot to kill oneself\n\n00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:08.713\nwas so as not to hurt other people.\n\n00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:12.134\nAnd finally one day, I woke up\n\n00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:14.355\nand I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,\n\n00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.873\nbecause I lay in bed completely frozen,\n\n00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:18.822\nlooking at the telephone, thinking,\n\n00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:22.385\n\"Something is wrong\nand I should call for help,\"\n\n00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.120\nand I couldn't reach out my arm\n\n00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:26.386\nand pick up the phone and dial.\n\n00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.810\nAnd finally, after four full hours\nof my lying and staring at it,\n\n00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:32.098\nthe phone rang,\n\n00:04:32.122 --> 00:04:34.501\nand somehow I managed to pick it up,\n\n00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:37.453\nand it was my father, and I said,\n\n00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.923\n\"I'm in serious trouble.\nWe need to do something.\"\n\n00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:46.177\nThe next day I started\nwith the medications and the therapy.\n\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.513\nAnd I also started reckoning\nwith this terrible question:\n\n00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:53.641\nIf I'm not the tough person\n\n00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:56.165\nwho could have made it\nthrough a concentration camp,\n\n00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.677\nthen who am I?\n\n00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:59.562\nAnd if I have to take medication,\n\n00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:03.499\nis that medication making me\nmore fully myself,\n\n00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:05.741\nor is it making me someone else?\n\n00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:09.225\nAnd how do I feel about it\nif it's making me someone else?\n\n00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.963\nI had two advantages\nas I went into the fight.\n\n00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:16.214\nThe first is that I knew that,\nobjectively speaking,\n\n00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:17.835\nI had a nice life,\n\n00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.720\nand that if I could only get well,\n\n00:05:19.744 --> 00:05:22.944\nthere was something at the other end\nthat was worth living for.\n\n00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:25.785\nAnd the other was\nthat I had access to good treatment.\n\n00:05:26.301 --> 00:05:29.750\nBut I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,\n\n00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:32.285\nand emerged and relapsed,\n\n00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.303\nand emerged and relapsed,\n\n00:05:35.327 --> 00:05:37.267\nand finally understood\n\n00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:41.212\nI would have to be on medication\nand in therapy forever.\n\n00:05:41.727 --> 00:05:42.894\nAnd I thought,\n\n00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:45.704\n\"But is it a chemical problem\nor a psychological problem?\n\n00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:49.661\nAnd does it need a chemical cure\nor a philosophical cure?\"\n\n00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:51.812\nAnd I couldn't figure out which it was.\n\n00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:53.936\nAnd then I understood that actually,\n\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.947\nwe aren't advanced enough in either area\nfor it to explain things fully.\n\n00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:01.298\nThe chemical cure\nand the psychological cure\n\n00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:02.996\nboth have a role to play,\n\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.994\nand I also figured out\nthat depression was something\n\n00:06:07.018 --> 00:06:09.242\nthat was braided so deep into us\n\n00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:12.954\nthat there was no separating it\nfrom our character and personality.\n\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.972\nI want to say that the treatments we have\nfor depression are appalling.\n\n00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:19.599\nThey're not very effective.\n\n00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:21.686\nThey're extremely costly.\n\n00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.207\nThey come with innumerable side effects.\n\n00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.668\nThey're a disaster.\n\n00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:30.652\nBut I am so grateful that I live now\nand not 50 years ago,\n\n00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:33.596\nwhen there would have been\nalmost nothing to be done.\n\n00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.003\nI hope that 50 years hence,\n\n00:06:36.027 --> 00:06:38.049\npeople will hear about my treatments\n\n00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:41.741\nand be appalled that anyone endured\nsuch primitive science.\n\n00:06:42.843 --> 00:06:46.085\nDepression is the flaw in love.\n\n00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:50.516\nIf you were married\nto someone and thought,\n\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.250\n\"Well, if my wife dies,\nI'll find another one,\"\n\n00:06:54.274 --> 00:06:56.523\nit wouldn't be love as we know it.\n\n00:06:57.322 --> 00:07:01.889\nThere's no such thing as love\nwithout the anticipation of loss,\n\n00:07:01.913 --> 00:07:07.469\nand that specter of despair\ncan be the engine of intimacy.\n\n00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:10.993\nThere are three things\npeople tend to confuse:\n\n00:07:11.017 --> 00:07:14.106\ndepression, grief and sadness.\n\n00:07:14.924 --> 00:07:18.263\nGrief is explicitly reactive.\n\n00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:21.168\nIf you have a loss\nand you feel incredibly unhappy,\n\n00:07:21.192 --> 00:07:22.867\nand then, six months later,\n\n00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.976\nyou are still deeply sad,\nbut you're functioning a little better,\n\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.785\nit's probably grief,\n\n00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:31.544\nand it will probably ultimately\nresolve itself in some measure.\n\n00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:34.373\nIf you experience a catastrophic loss,\n\n00:07:34.397 --> 00:07:35.699\nand you feel terrible,\n\n00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:38.512\nand six months later\nyou can barely function at all,\n\n00:07:38.536 --> 00:07:41.050\nthen it's probably a depression\nthat was triggered\n\n00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:43.257\nby the catastrophic circumstances.\n\n00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:46.776\nThe trajectory tells us a great deal.\n\n00:07:47.154 --> 00:07:50.514\nPeople think of depression\nas being just sadness.\n\n00:07:50.538 --> 00:07:52.709\nIt's much, much too much sadness,\n\n00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:54.484\nmuch too much grief\n\n00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.617\nat far too slight a cause.\n\n00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:00.213\nAs I set out to understand depression,\n\n00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:02.884\nand to interview people\nwho had experienced it,\n\n00:08:02.908 --> 00:08:06.701\nI found that there were people\nwho seemed, on the surface,\n\n00:08:06.725 --> 00:08:09.938\nto have what sounded like\nrelatively mild depression\n\n00:08:09.962 --> 00:08:12.700\nwho were nonetheless\nutterly disabled by it.\n\n00:08:13.255 --> 00:08:15.668\nAnd there were other people\nwho had what sounded\n\n00:08:15.692 --> 00:08:18.754\nas they described it\nlike terribly severe depression\n\n00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:20.518\nwho nonetheless had good lives\n\n00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.248\nin the interstices\nbetween their depressive episodes.\n\n00:08:23.843 --> 00:08:27.808\nAnd I set out to find out\nwhat it is that causes some people\n\n00:08:27.832 --> 00:08:30.061\nto be more resilient than other people.\n\n00:08:30.085 --> 00:08:33.301\nWhat are the mechanisms\nthat allow people to survive?\n\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.808\nAnd I went out and I interviewed\nperson after person\n\n00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:38.808\nwho was suffering with depression.\n\n00:08:38.832 --> 00:08:41.023\nOne of the first people I interviewed\n\n00:08:41.047 --> 00:08:45.901\ndescribed depression\nas a slower way of being dead,\n\n00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:48.259\nand that was a good thing\nfor me to hear early on\n\n00:08:48.283 --> 00:08:51.390\nbecause it reminded me\nthat that slow way of being dead\n\n00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:53.694\ncan lead to actual deadness,\n\n00:08:53.718 --> 00:08:55.675\nthat this is a serious business.\n\n00:08:55.699 --> 00:08:58.088\nIt's the leading disability worldwide,\n\n00:08:58.112 --> 00:09:00.194\nand people die of it every day.\n\n00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:04.861\nOne of the people I talked to\nwhen I was trying to understand this\n\n00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:08.746\nwas a beloved friend\nwho I had known for many years,\n\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.223\nand who had had a psychotic episode\nin her freshman year of college,\n\n00:09:13.247 --> 00:09:16.049\nand then plummeted\ninto a horrific depression.\n\n00:09:16.073 --> 00:09:17.712\nShe had bipolar illness,\n\n00:09:17.736 --> 00:09:20.223\nor manic depression, as it was then known.\n\n00:09:20.247 --> 00:09:24.032\nAnd then she did very well\nfor many years on lithium,\n\n00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:27.205\nand then eventually,\nshe was taken off her lithium\n\n00:09:27.229 --> 00:09:29.040\nto see how she would do without it,\n\n00:09:29.064 --> 00:09:31.015\nand she had another psychosis,\n\n00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:35.399\nand then plunged into the worst depression\nthat I had ever seen\n\n00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:38.240\nin which she sat\nin her parents' apartment,\n\n00:09:38.264 --> 00:09:41.536\nmore or less catatonic,\nessentially without moving,\n\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.473\nday after day after day.\n\n00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:47.385\nAnd when I interviewed her\nabout that experience some years later --\n\n00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:50.510\nshe's a poet and psychotherapist\nnamed Maggie Robbins --\n\n00:09:50.534 --> 00:09:53.580\nwhen I interviewed her, she said,\n\n00:09:53.604 --> 00:09:57.123\n\"I was singing 'Where Have\nAll The Flowers Gone,'\n\n00:09:57.147 --> 00:10:00.044\nover and over, to occupy my mind.\n\n00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:03.309\nI was singing to blot out\nthe things my mind was saying,\n\n00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:08.093\nwhich were, 'You are nothing.\nYou are nobody.\n\n00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:10.048\nYou don't even deserve to live.'\n\n00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:13.055\nAnd that was\nwhen I really started thinking\n\n00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.433\nabout killing myself.\"\n\n00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:19.061\nYou don't think in depression\nthat you've put on a gray veil\n\n00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:22.449\nand are seeing the world\nthrough the haze of a bad mood.\n\n00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:25.949\nYou think that the veil\nhas been taken away,\n\n00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:27.577\nthe veil of happiness,\n\n00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.538\nand that now you're seeing truly.\n\n00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:32.965\nIt's easier to help\nschizophrenics who perceive\n\n00:10:32.989 --> 00:10:36.963\nthat there's something foreign\ninside of them that needs to be exorcised,\n\n00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:39.313\nbut it's difficult with depressives,\n\n00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:42.139\nbecause we believe\nwe are seeing the truth.\n\n00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:44.543\nBut the truth lies.\n\n00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.919\nI became obsessed with that sentence:\n\n00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:50.075\n\"But the truth lies.\"\n\n00:10:50.393 --> 00:10:52.833\nAnd I discovered,\nas I talked to depressive people,\n\n00:10:52.857 --> 00:10:55.429\nthat they have\nmany delusional perceptions.\n\n00:10:55.773 --> 00:10:57.511\nPeople will say, \"No one loves me.\"\n\n00:10:57.535 --> 00:10:58.747\nAnd you say, \"I love you,\n\n00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:01.269\nyour wife loves you,\nyour mother loves you.\"\n\n00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:04.654\nYou can answer that one pretty readily,\nat least for most people.\n\n00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:07.248\nBut people who are depressed\nwill also say,\n\n00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:11.319\n\"No matter what we do,\nwe're all just going to die in the end.\"\n\n00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:13.572\nOr they'll say,\n\"There can be no true communion\n\n00:11:13.596 --> 00:11:14.958\nbetween two human beings.\n\n00:11:14.982 --> 00:11:17.366\nEach of us is trapped in his own body.\"\n\n00:11:17.763 --> 00:11:19.383\nTo which you have to say,\n\n00:11:19.407 --> 00:11:20.886\n\"That's true,\n\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.418\nbut I think we should focus right now\non what to have for breakfast.\"\n\n00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:26.603\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:26.627 --> 00:11:28.272\nA lot of the time,\n\n00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:31.270\nwhat they are expressing\nis not illness, but insight,\n\n00:11:31.294 --> 00:11:33.825\nand one comes to think\nwhat's really extraordinary\n\n00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:36.981\nis that most of us know\nabout those existential questions\n\n00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:39.049\nand they don't distract us very much.\n\n00:11:39.386 --> 00:11:41.208\nThere was a study I particularly liked\n\n00:11:41.232 --> 00:11:44.975\nin which a group of depressed\nand a group of non-depressed people\n\n00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.723\nwere asked to play a video\ngame for an hour,\n\n00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:49.367\nand at the end of the hour,\n\n00:11:49.391 --> 00:11:53.001\nthey were asked how many little monsters\nthey thought they had killed.\n\n00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:57.010\nThe depressive group was usually accurate\nto within about 10 percent,\n\n00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:58.605\nand the non-depressed people\n\n00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:03.083\nguessed between 15 and 20 times\nas many little monsters --\n\n00:12:03.107 --> 00:12:04.258\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:04.282 --> 00:12:06.034\nas they had actually killed.\n\n00:12:07.903 --> 00:12:11.119\nA lot of people said, when I chose\nto write about my depression,\n\n00:12:11.143 --> 00:12:14.608\nthat it must be very difficult\nto be out of that closet,\n\n00:12:14.632 --> 00:12:15.941\nto have people know.\n\n00:12:15.965 --> 00:12:18.234\nThey said, \"Do people\ntalk to you differently?\"\n\n00:12:18.258 --> 00:12:20.337\nI said, \"Yes, people\ntalk to me differently.\n\n00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:22.123\nThey talk to me differently insofar\n\n00:12:22.147 --> 00:12:24.814\nas they start telling me\nabout their experience,\n\n00:12:24.838 --> 00:12:26.649\nor their sister's experience,\n\n00:12:26.673 --> 00:12:28.314\nor their friend's experience.\n\n00:12:28.687 --> 00:12:30.885\nThings are different because now I know\n\n00:12:30.909 --> 00:12:35.014\nthat depression is the family secret\nthat everyone has.\n\n00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:39.299\nI went a few years ago to a conference,\n\n00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:41.754\nand on Friday of the three-day conference,\n\n00:12:41.778 --> 00:12:44.783\none of the participants\ntook me aside, and she said,\n\n00:12:44.807 --> 00:12:51.056\n\"I suffer from depression\nand I'm a little embarrassed about it,\n\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.922\nbut I've been taking this medication,\n\n00:12:52.946 --> 00:12:56.060\nand I just wanted to ask you\nwhat you think?\"\n\n00:12:56.084 --> 00:12:58.704\nAnd so I did my best to give her\nsuch advice as I could.\n\n00:12:58.728 --> 00:13:03.215\nAnd then she said, \"You know,\nmy husband would never understand this.\n\n00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:06.507\nHe's really the kind of guy to whom\nthis wouldn't make any sense,\n\n00:13:06.531 --> 00:13:08.655\nso, you know, it's just between us.\"\n\n00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:10.231\nAnd I said, \"Yes, that's fine.\"\n\n00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:12.550\nOn Sunday of the same conference,\n\n00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:14.450\nher husband took me aside,\n\n00:13:14.474 --> 00:13:15.788\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:15.812 --> 00:13:17.573\nand he said, \"My wife wouldn't think\n\n00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:19.908\nthat I was really much\nof a guy if she knew this,\n\n00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:23.690\nbut I've been dealing with this depression\nand I'm taking some medication,\n\n00:13:23.714 --> 00:13:26.139\nand I wondered what you think?\"\n\n00:13:26.163 --> 00:13:28.453\nThey were hiding the same medication\n\n00:13:28.477 --> 00:13:31.852\nin two different places\nin the same bedroom.\n\n00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:33.074\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:33.098 --> 00:13:36.036\nAnd I said that I thought\ncommunication within the marriage\n\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.108\nmight be triggering\nsome of their problems.\n\n00:13:38.132 --> 00:13:40.624\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:44.114\nBut I was also struck\n\n00:13:44.138 --> 00:13:47.656\nby the burdensome nature\nof such mutual secrecy.\n\n00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:49.960\nDepression is so exhausting.\n\n00:13:49.984 --> 00:13:52.930\nIt takes up so much\nof your time and energy,\n\n00:13:52.954 --> 00:13:54.485\nand silence about it,\n\n00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:56.766\nit really does make the depression worse.\n\n00:13:57.234 --> 00:13:58.443\nAnd then I began thinking\n\n00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:00.790\nabout all the ways\npeople make themselves better.\n\n00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:03.275\nI'd started off as a medical conservative.\n\n00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:05.933\nI thought there were a few\nkinds of therapy that worked,\n\n00:14:05.957 --> 00:14:07.402\nit was clear what they were --\n\n00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:08.926\nthere was medication,\n\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.617\nthere were certain psychotherapies,\n\n00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:13.062\nthere was possibly\nelectroconvulsive treatment,\n\n00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:15.675\nand that everything else was nonsense.\n\n00:14:15.699 --> 00:14:17.627\nBut then I discovered something.\n\n00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:19.284\nIf you have brain cancer,\n\n00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:22.496\nand you say that standing on your head\nfor 20 minutes every morning\n\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.673\nmakes you feel better,\n\n00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.675\nit may make you feel better,\nbut you still have brain cancer,\n\n00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.772\nand you'll still probably die from it.\n\n00:14:29.345 --> 00:14:31.631\nBut if you say that you have depression,\n\n00:14:31.655 --> 00:14:33.995\nand standing on your head\nfor 20 minutes every day\n\n00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:36.215\nmakes you feel better, then it's worked,\n\n00:14:36.239 --> 00:14:38.680\nbecause depression\nis an illness of how you feel,\n\n00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:40.034\nand if you feel better,\n\n00:14:40.058 --> 00:14:42.617\nthen you are effectively\nnot depressed anymore.\n\n00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.157\nSo I became much more tolerant\n\n00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:47.569\nof the vast world\nof alternative treatments.\n\n00:14:47.894 --> 00:14:50.206\nAnd I get letters,\nI get hundreds of letters\n\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.040\nfrom people writing to tell me\nabout what's worked for them.\n\n00:14:53.064 --> 00:14:56.629\nSomeone was asking me\nbackstage today about meditation.\n\n00:14:56.653 --> 00:15:00.325\nMy favorite of the letters that I got\nwas the one that came from a woman\n\n00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:03.270\nwho wrote and said\nthat she had tried therapy, medication,\n\n00:15:03.294 --> 00:15:05.124\nshe had tried pretty much everything,\n\n00:15:05.148 --> 00:15:08.054\nand she had found a solution\nand hoped I would tell the world,\n\n00:15:08.078 --> 00:15:11.650\nand that was making\nlittle things from yarn.\n\n00:15:11.674 --> 00:15:14.567\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:14.591 --> 00:15:16.127\nShe sent me some of them.\n\n00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:18.181\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:20.070\nAnd I'm not wearing them right now.\n\n00:15:20.094 --> 00:15:21.244\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:21.803 --> 00:15:24.294\nI suggested to her\nthat she also should look up\n\n00:15:24.318 --> 00:15:27.724\nobsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.\n\n00:15:28.937 --> 00:15:31.627\nAnd yet, when I went to look\nat alternative treatments,\n\n00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:34.079\nI also gained perspective\non other treatments.\n\n00:15:34.563 --> 00:15:37.281\nI went through\na tribal exorcism in Senegal\n\n00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:39.294\nthat involved a great deal of ram's blood\n\n00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:41.356\nand that I'm not going\nto detail right now,\n\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.380\nbut a few years afterwards\nI was in Rwanda,\n\n00:15:43.404 --> 00:15:45.301\nworking on a different project,\n\n00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:47.910\nand I happened to describe\nmy experience to someone,\n\n00:15:47.934 --> 00:15:49.093\nand he said,\n\n00:15:49.117 --> 00:15:51.575\n\"Well, that's West Africa,\nand we're in East Africa,\n\n00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:53.856\nand our rituals are\nin some ways very different,\n\n00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.181\nbut we do have some rituals\n\n00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:58.005\nthat have something in common\nwith what you're describing.\"\n\n00:15:58.029 --> 00:15:59.196\nAnd he said,\n\n00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.431\n\"But we've had a lot of trouble\nwith Western mental health workers,\n\n00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:05.073\nespecially the ones who came\nright after the genocide.\"\n\n00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.147\nI said, \"What kind\nof trouble did you have?\"\n\n00:16:07.171 --> 00:16:10.923\nAnd he said, \"Well,\nthey would do this bizarre thing.\n\n00:16:10.947 --> 00:16:12.995\nThey didn't take people out\nin the sunshine\n\n00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:14.508\nwhere you begin to feel better.\n\n00:16:14.532 --> 00:16:17.684\nThey didn't include drumming\nor music to get people's blood going.\n\n00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:19.614\nThey didn't involve the whole community.\n\n00:16:19.638 --> 00:16:22.874\nThey didn't externalize\nthe depression as an invasive spirit.\n\n00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:27.911\nInstead what they did was they took people\none at a time into dingy little rooms\n\n00:16:27.935 --> 00:16:29.316\nand had them talk for an hour\n\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.484\nabout bad things\nthat had happened to them.\"\n\n00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:33.551\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:36.944\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:36.968 --> 00:16:39.397\nHe said, \"We had to ask them\nto leave the country.\"\n\n00:16:39.421 --> 00:16:42.363\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:42.387 --> 00:16:44.965\nNow at the other end\nof alternative treatments,\n\n00:16:44.989 --> 00:16:47.084\nlet me tell you about Frank Russakoff.\n\n00:16:47.108 --> 00:16:52.810\nFrank Russakoff had the worst depression\nperhaps that I've ever seen in a man.\n\n00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:54.803\nHe was constantly depressed.\n\n00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:56.272\nHe was, when I met him,\n\n00:16:56.296 --> 00:17:00.102\nat a point at which every month,\nhe would have electroshock treatment.\n\n00:17:00.126 --> 00:17:02.677\nThen he would feel\nsort of disoriented for a week.\n\n00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:04.480\nThen he would feel okay for a week.\n\n00:17:04.504 --> 00:17:06.598\nThen he would have a week\nof going downhill.\n\n00:17:06.622 --> 00:17:09.212\nAnd then he would have another\nelectroshock treatment.\n\n00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:10.809\nAnd he said to me when I met him,\n\n00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:13.198\n\"It's unbearable to go\nthrough my weeks this way.\n\n00:17:13.222 --> 00:17:14.669\nI can't go on this way,\n\n00:17:14.693 --> 00:17:16.803\nand I've figured out\nhow I'm going to end it\n\n00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.160\nif I don't get better.\"\n\n00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:22.286\n\"But,\" he said to me,\n\"I heard about a protocol at Mass General\n\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.532\nfor a procedure called a cingulotomy,\nwhich is a brain surgery,\n\n00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:27.825\nand I think I'm going to give that a try.\"\n\n00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:31.142\nAnd I remember being amazed\nat that point to think that someone\n\n00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:34.163\nwho clearly had so many bad experiences\n\n00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:36.323\nwith so many different treatments\n\n00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:39.387\nstill had buried in him,\nsomewhere, enough optimism\n\n00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:41.196\nto reach out for one more.\n\n00:17:41.718 --> 00:17:45.915\nAnd he had the cingulotomy,\nand it was incredibly successful.\n\n00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:47.551\nHe's now a friend of mine.\n\n00:17:47.575 --> 00:17:50.900\nHe has a lovely wife\nand two beautiful children.\n\n00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:53.849\nHe wrote me a letter\nthe Christmas after the surgery,\n\n00:17:53.873 --> 00:17:55.038\nand he said,\n\n00:17:55.062 --> 00:17:57.665\n\"My father sent me two presents this year,\n\n00:17:57.689 --> 00:18:00.216\nFirst, a motorized CD rack\nfrom The Sharper Image\n\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.638\nthat I didn't really need,\n\n00:18:01.662 --> 00:18:03.899\nbut I knew he was giving it\nto me to celebrate\n\n00:18:03.923 --> 00:18:07.172\nthe fact that I'm living on my own\nand have a job I seem to love.\n\n00:18:07.593 --> 00:18:10.834\nAnd the other present\nwas a photo of my grandmother,\n\n00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:12.334\nwho committed suicide.\n\n00:18:12.913 --> 00:18:15.818\nAs I unwrapped it, I began to cry,\n\n00:18:15.842 --> 00:18:17.699\nand my mother came over and said,\n\n00:18:17.723 --> 00:18:20.715\n'Are you crying because\nof the relatives you never knew?'\n\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.668\nAnd I said, 'She had\nthe same disease I have.'\n\n00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.812\nI'm crying now as I write to you.\n\n00:18:27.836 --> 00:18:31.123\nIt's not that I'm so sad,\nbut I get overwhelmed,\n\n00:18:31.147 --> 00:18:33.344\nI think, because I could\nhave killed myself,\n\n00:18:33.368 --> 00:18:36.796\nbut my parents kept me going,\nand so did the doctors,\n\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.650\nand I had the surgery.\n\n00:18:38.674 --> 00:18:40.756\nI'm alive and grateful.\n\n00:18:41.489 --> 00:18:46.090\nWe live in the right time,\neven if it doesn't always feel like it.\"\n\n00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:49.733\nI was struck by the fact that depression\n\n00:18:49.757 --> 00:18:54.763\nis broadly perceived to be\na modern, Western, middle-class thing,\n\n00:18:54.787 --> 00:18:58.918\nand I went to look at how it operated\nin a variety of other contexts,\n\n00:18:58.942 --> 00:19:01.133\nand one of the things\nI was most interested in\n\n00:19:01.157 --> 00:19:03.072\nwas depression among the indigent.\n\n00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:04.644\nAnd so I went out to try to look\n\n00:19:04.668 --> 00:19:07.421\nat what was being done\nfor poor people with depression.\n\n00:19:07.445 --> 00:19:09.572\nAnd what I discovered is that poor people\n\n00:19:09.596 --> 00:19:12.124\nare mostly not being\ntreated for depression.\n\n00:19:12.148 --> 00:19:14.822\nDepression is the result\nof a genetic vulnerability,\n\n00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:18.196\nwhich is presumably\nevenly distributed in the population,\n\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.933\nand triggering circumstances,\n\n00:19:19.957 --> 00:19:23.711\nwhich are likely to be more severe\nfor people who are impoverished.\n\n00:19:23.735 --> 00:19:27.238\nAnd yet it turns out that if you have\na really lovely life\n\n00:19:27.262 --> 00:19:28.844\nbut feel miserable all the time,\n\n00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:30.654\nyou think, \"Why do I feel like this?\n\n00:19:30.678 --> 00:19:31.947\nI must have depression.\"\n\n00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:34.107\nAnd you set out to find treatment for it.\n\n00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.063\nBut if you have a perfectly awful life,\n\n00:19:36.087 --> 00:19:37.830\nand you feel miserable all the time,\n\n00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:40.864\nthe way you feel\nis commensurate with your life,\n\n00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:42.743\nand it doesn't occur to you to think,\n\n00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:44.304\n\"Maybe this is treatable.\"\n\n00:19:44.328 --> 00:19:47.530\nAnd so we have an epidemic in this country\n\n00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:50.212\nof depression among impoverished people\n\n00:19:50.236 --> 00:19:52.808\nthat's not being picked up\nand that's not being treated\n\n00:19:52.832 --> 00:19:54.780\nand that's not being addressed,\n\n00:19:54.804 --> 00:19:56.875\nand it's a tragedy of a grand order.\n\n00:19:57.177 --> 00:19:58.777\nAnd so I found an academic\n\n00:19:58.801 --> 00:20:02.026\nwho was doing a research project\nin slums outside of D.C.,\n\n00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.193\nwhere she picked up women\nwho had come in for other health problems\n\n00:20:05.217 --> 00:20:06.972\nand diagnosed them with depression,\n\n00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:10.068\nand then provided six months\nof the experimental protocol.\n\n00:20:10.092 --> 00:20:12.397\nOne of them, Lolly, came in,\n\n00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:14.694\nand this is what she said\nthe day she came in.\n\n00:20:15.027 --> 00:20:19.592\nShe said, and she was a woman,\nby the way, who had seven children.\n\n00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:22.401\nShe said, \"I used to have a job\nbut I had to give it up\n\n00:20:22.425 --> 00:20:24.640\nbecause I couldn't go out of the house.\n\n00:20:25.092 --> 00:20:27.032\nI have nothing to say to my children.\n\n00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:29.887\nIn the morning,\nI can't wait for them to leave,\n\n00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:33.113\nand then I climb in bed\nand pull the covers over my head,\n\n00:20:33.137 --> 00:20:35.012\nand three o'clock when they come home,\n\n00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:36.478\nit just comes so fast.\"\n\n00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:38.796\nShe said, \"I've been taking\na lot of Tylenol,\n\n00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.323\nanything I can take\nso that I can sleep more.\n\n00:20:41.347 --> 00:20:45.344\nMy husband has been telling me\nI'm stupid, I'm ugly.\n\n00:20:45.368 --> 00:20:48.122\nI wish I could stop the pain.\"\n\n00:20:48.893 --> 00:20:51.489\nWell, she was brought\ninto this experimental protocol,\n\n00:20:51.513 --> 00:20:53.704\nand when I interviewed her\nsix months later,\n\n00:20:53.728 --> 00:20:57.953\nshe had taken a job working in childcare\n\n00:20:57.977 --> 00:21:02.027\nfor the U.S. Navy,\nshe had left the abusive husband,\n\n00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:04.074\nand she said to me,\n\n00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:06.353\n\"My kids are so much happier now.\"\n\n00:21:06.377 --> 00:21:09.059\nShe said, \"There's one room\nin my new place for the boys\n\n00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:10.970\nand one room for the girls,\n\n00:21:10.994 --> 00:21:13.333\nbut at night, they're just\nall up on my bed,\n\n00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:15.945\nand we're doing homework\nall together and everything.\n\n00:21:15.969 --> 00:21:17.643\nOne of them wants to be a preacher,\n\n00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:19.560\none of them wants to be a firefighter,\n\n00:21:19.584 --> 00:21:22.284\nand one of the girls says\nshe's going to be a lawyer.\n\n00:21:22.308 --> 00:21:24.512\nThey don't cry like they used to,\n\n00:21:24.536 --> 00:21:26.346\nand they don't fight like they did.\n\n00:21:27.102 --> 00:21:29.927\nThat's all I need now, is my kids.\n\n00:21:30.784 --> 00:21:32.729\nThings keep on changing,\n\n00:21:32.753 --> 00:21:37.129\nthe way I dress,\nthe way I feel, the way I act.\n\n00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:41.668\nI can go outside not being afraid anymore,\n\n00:21:41.692 --> 00:21:45.180\nand I don't think\nthose bad feelings are coming back,\n\n00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:48.140\nand if it weren't\nfor Dr. Miranda and that,\n\n00:21:48.164 --> 00:21:51.686\nI would still be at home\nwith the covers pulled over my head,\n\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.563\nif I were still alive at all.\n\n00:21:54.055 --> 00:21:57.561\nI asked the Lord to send me an angel,\n\n00:21:57.585 --> 00:21:59.362\nand He heard my prayers.\"\n\n00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:05.246\nI was really moved by these experiences,\n\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.785\nand I decided that I wanted\nto write about them\n\n00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:10.626\nnot only in a book I was working on,\nbut also in an article,\n\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.229\nand I got a commission\nfrom The New York Times Magazine\n\n00:22:13.253 --> 00:22:15.372\nto write about depression\namong the indigent.\n\n00:22:15.396 --> 00:22:16.633\nAnd I turned in my story,\n\n00:22:16.657 --> 00:22:20.117\nand my editor called me and said,\n\"We really can't publish this.\"\n\n00:22:20.626 --> 00:22:21.785\nAnd I said, \"Why not?\"\n\n00:22:21.809 --> 00:22:23.880\nAnd she said, \"It just is too far-fetched.\n\n00:22:23.904 --> 00:22:27.567\nThese people who are sort of\nat the very bottom rung of society\n\n00:22:27.591 --> 00:22:29.606\nand then they get\na few months of treatment\n\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.003\nand they're virtually ready\nto run Morgan Stanley?\n\n00:22:32.027 --> 00:22:33.543\nIt's just too implausible.\"\n\n00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:36.552\nShe said, \"I've never even heard\nof anything like it.\"\n\n00:22:36.576 --> 00:22:39.029\nAnd I said, \"The fact\nthat you've never heard of it\n\n00:22:39.053 --> 00:22:41.156\nis an indication that it is news.\"\n\n00:22:41.865 --> 00:22:45.888\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:45.912 --> 00:22:49.251\n(Applause)\n\n00:22:49.275 --> 00:22:51.392\n\"And you are a news magazine.\"\n\n00:22:51.908 --> 00:22:54.968\nSo after a certain amount of negotiation,\nthey agreed to it.\n\n00:22:54.992 --> 00:22:58.878\nBut I think a lot of what they said\nwas connected in some strange way\n\n00:22:58.902 --> 00:23:02.483\nto this distaste that people still have\nfor the idea of treatment,\n\n00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:04.365\nthe notion that somehow if we went out\n\n00:23:04.389 --> 00:23:07.212\nand treated a lot of people\nin indigent communities,\n\n00:23:07.236 --> 00:23:09.092\nthat would be exploitative,\n\n00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:10.814\nbecause we would be changing them.\n\n00:23:10.838 --> 00:23:14.645\nThere is this false moral imperative\nthat seems to be all around us,\n\n00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:16.777\nthat treatment of depression,\n\n00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:19.076\nthe medications and so on,\nare an artifice,\n\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.423\nand that it's not natural.\n\n00:23:21.447 --> 00:23:24.390\nAnd I think that's very misguided.\n\n00:23:24.414 --> 00:23:27.747\nIt would be natural\nfor people's teeth to fall out,\n\n00:23:27.771 --> 00:23:30.959\nbut there is nobody militating\nagainst toothpaste,\n\n00:23:30.983 --> 00:23:32.453\nat least not in my circles.\n\n00:23:33.873 --> 00:23:35.117\nPeople then say,\n\n00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:38.402\n\"But isn't depression part of what people\nare supposed to experience?\n\n00:23:38.426 --> 00:23:40.158\nDidn't we evolve to have depression?\n\n00:23:40.182 --> 00:23:41.933\nIsn't it part of your personality?\"\n\n00:23:41.957 --> 00:23:44.396\nTo which I would say, mood is adaptive.\n\n00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.497\nBeing able to have sadness and fear\n\n00:23:47.521 --> 00:23:49.427\nand joy and pleasure\n\n00:23:49.451 --> 00:23:53.206\nand all of the other moods that we have,\nthat's incredibly valuable.\n\n00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.144\nAnd major depression\n\n00:23:55.168 --> 00:23:58.530\nis something that happens\nwhen that system gets broken.\n\n00:23:58.554 --> 00:24:00.158\nIt's maladaptive.\n\n00:24:00.182 --> 00:24:01.797\nPeople will come to me and say,\n\n00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:04.623\n\"I think, though, if I just\nstick it out for another year,\n\n00:24:04.647 --> 00:24:06.500\nI think I can just get through this.\"\n\n00:24:06.524 --> 00:24:09.048\nAnd I always say to them,\n\"You may get through it,\n\n00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:11.262\nbut you'll never be 37 again.\n\n00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:15.400\nLife is short, and that's a whole year\nyou're talking about giving up.\n\n00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.091\nThink it through.\"\n\n00:24:17.652 --> 00:24:20.300\nIt's a strange poverty\nof the English language,\n\n00:24:20.324 --> 00:24:22.408\nand indeed of many other languages,\n\n00:24:22.432 --> 00:24:24.802\nthat we use this same word, depression,\n\n00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:28.540\nto describe how a kid feels\nwhen it rains on his birthday,\n\n00:24:28.564 --> 00:24:32.923\nand to describe how somebody feels\nthe minute before they commit suicide.\n\n00:24:33.453 --> 00:24:36.459\nPeople say to me, \"Well, is it\ncontinuous with normal sadness?\"\n\n00:24:36.483 --> 00:24:39.590\nAnd I say, in a way it's continuous\nwith normal sadness.\n\n00:24:39.614 --> 00:24:41.788\nThere is a certain amount of continuity,\n\n00:24:41.812 --> 00:24:43.749\nbut it's the same way there's continuity\n\n00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:45.979\nbetween having an iron fence\noutside your house\n\n00:24:46.003 --> 00:24:47.423\nthat gets a little rust spot\n\n00:24:47.447 --> 00:24:50.045\nthat you have to sand off\nand do a little repainting,\n\n00:24:50.069 --> 00:24:52.897\nand what happens if you leave\nthe house for 100 years\n\n00:24:52.921 --> 00:24:56.720\nand it rusts through\nuntil it's only a pile of orange dust.\n\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.893\nAnd it's that orange dust spot,\n\n00:24:58.917 --> 00:25:00.682\nthat orange dust problem,\n\n00:25:00.706 --> 00:25:03.292\nthat's the one\nwe're setting out to address.\n\n00:25:03.998 --> 00:25:06.212\nSo now people say,\n\n00:25:06.236 --> 00:25:08.915\n\"You take these happy pills,\nand do you feel happy?\"\n\n00:25:08.939 --> 00:25:10.129\nAnd I don't.\n\n00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:13.520\nBut I don't feel sad\nabout having to eat lunch,\n\n00:25:13.544 --> 00:25:16.385\nand I don't feel sad\nabout my answering machine,\n\n00:25:16.409 --> 00:25:18.607\nand I don't feel sad\nabout taking a shower.\n\n00:25:19.282 --> 00:25:21.885\nI feel more, in fact, I think,\n\n00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:24.315\nbecause I can feel\nsadness without nullity.\n\n00:25:24.662 --> 00:25:28.868\nI feel sad about professional\ndisappointments,\n\n00:25:28.892 --> 00:25:31.176\nabout damaged relationships,\n\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.717\nabout global warming.\n\n00:25:33.072 --> 00:25:35.773\nThose are the things\nthat I feel sad about now.\n\n00:25:35.797 --> 00:25:38.507\nAnd I said to myself, well,\nwhat is the conclusion?\n\n00:25:38.531 --> 00:25:41.068\nHow did those people who have better lives\n\n00:25:41.092 --> 00:25:43.622\neven with bigger depression\nmanage to get through?\n\n00:25:43.922 --> 00:25:46.073\nWhat is the mechanism of resilience?\n\n00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:48.503\nAnd what I came up with over time\n\n00:25:48.527 --> 00:25:51.353\nwas that the people\nwho deny their experience,\n\n00:25:51.377 --> 00:25:53.393\nand say, \"I was depressed a long time ago,\n\n00:25:53.417 --> 00:25:55.188\nI never want to think about it again,\n\n00:25:55.212 --> 00:25:56.506\nI'm not going to look at it\n\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.553\nand I'm just going\nto get on with my life,\"\n\n00:25:58.577 --> 00:26:03.175\nironically, those are the people\nwho are most enslaved by what they have.\n\n00:26:03.199 --> 00:26:05.397\nShutting out the depression\nstrengthens it.\n\n00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:08.428\nWhile you hide from it, it grows.\n\n00:26:09.143 --> 00:26:11.681\nAnd the people who do better\n\n00:26:11.705 --> 00:26:16.258\nare the ones who are able to tolerate\nthe fact that they have this condition.\n\n00:26:16.282 --> 00:26:20.154\nThose who can tolerate their depression\nare the ones who achieve resilience.\n\n00:26:20.474 --> 00:26:22.086\nSo Frank Russakoff said to me,\n\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.832\n\"If I had a do-over,\nI suppose I wouldn't do it this way,\n\n00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:29.324\nbut in a strange way,\nI'm grateful for what I've experienced.\n\n00:26:29.348 --> 00:26:32.672\nI'm glad to have been\nin the hospital 40 times.\n\n00:26:32.981 --> 00:26:35.592\nIt taught me so much about

00:26:44.632\nAnd Maggie Robbins said,\n\n00:26:44.656 --> 00:26:47.621\n\"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,\n\n00:26:47.645 --> 00:26:50.635\nand I would just talk and talk and talk,\n\n00:26:50.659 --> 00:26:54.692\nand the people I was dealing with\nweren't very responsive, and I thought,\n\n00:26:54.716 --> 00:26:57.212\n'That's not very friendly\nor helpful of

I didn't have AIDS\nand I wasn't dying,\n\n00:27:09.852 --> 00:27:12.730\nbut could tolerate the fact that they did\n\n00:27:12.754 --> 00:27:13.969\nand they were.\n\n00:27:14.461 -->

meaningful.\n\n00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:45.230\nIt's of seeking that meaning\nand thinking, when it comes again,\n\n00:27:45.254 --> 00:27:48.571\n\"This will be hellish,\nbut I will learn something

"https://www.ted.com/talks/krista_donaldson_the_80_prosthetic_knee_that_s_changing_lives", "transcript": "Nine years ago, I worked for the U.S. government in Iraq, helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure. And I was there, and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives. One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad, and he said to me, \"You Americans, you can put a man on the moon, but when I get home tonight, I won't be able to turn on my lights.\" At the time, the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction. How do you ensure technology reaches users? How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful?So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at D-Rev ask ourselves. And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution. And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users, and not just any users, but customers who live on less than four dollars a day. One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then, there are some commonalities. Despite the advanced technology, it's not reaching the people who need it most.So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on, the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee for above-knee amputees. And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization, the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world, came to the Bay Area and they said, \"We need a better knee.\" Chances are, if you're living on less than four dollars a day, and you're an amputee, you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident. Most people think it's land mines, but it's a vehicle accident. You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck, or you're trying to to jump on a moving train, you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught. And the reality is that if you don't have much money, like this young named Kamal right here, the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around. And how big a problem is this? There's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee.And what are their options? This is a high-end. This is what we'd call a \"smart knee.\" It's got a microprocessor inside. It can pretty much do anything, but it's 20,000 dollars, and to give you a sense of who wears this, veterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this. This is a low-end titanium knee. It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism, that mimics a natural human knee. But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive for people like Kamal. And lastly, here you see a low-end knee. This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people. And while you have affordability, you've lost on functionality. The mechanism here is a single axis, and a single axis is like a door hinge. So you can think about how unstable that would be. And this is the type of mechanismthat the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee, and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like, because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think  how it all fits together. So at the top you have a socket, and this fits over someone's residual limb, and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different. And then you have the knee, and here I've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates, and then a pylon, and then a foot. And we've been able to develop a knee, a polycentric knee, so that type of knee that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait, for 80 dollars retail.(Applause)But the key is, you can have this great invention, you can have this great design, but how do you get it to the people who most need it? How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects, and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers, to users, to people who need it.And the first thing is that the product  needs to be world class. It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market. Regardless of your income level, you want the most beautiful, the best product that there is. I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash. You can see him walking. He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee. And he's doing a 10-meter walk test. And you'll notice that he's struggling  with stability as he's walking. And something that's not obvious, that you can't see, is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling. Now this is a video of Kamal. You remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff. He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee, and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test. And you can see his stability is much better.So world class isn't just about technical performance. It's also about human performance. And most medical devices, we've learned, as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners, for wealthier economies. But the reality is our users, our customers, they do different things. They sit cross-legged more. We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer. And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market.So the second thing we learned, and this leads into my second point, which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user-centric. And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say you need to be user-obsessed. So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about, but everyone who interacts with the product, so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee, but also the context in which the knee is being fit. What is the local market like? How do all these components get to the clinic? Do they all get there on time? The supply chain. Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user, and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee, so this is it right here. (Clicking) Notice anything about it? It clicks. We'd seen that users had actually modified it. So do you see that black strip right there? That's a homemade noise dampener. We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways. You can see there that that particular amputee, he had wrapped bandages around the knee. He'd made a cosmesis. And if you look at the knee, it's got those pointy edges, right? So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari, it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb, and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled, people are particularly acute about this.So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did. We did a lot of iterations, not just  around this, but some other things. But here we have the version three,  the ReMotion Knee, but if you look in here, you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter. The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile. We made it thinner. And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production.And this goes into my last point. We really, truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed, it needs to be market-driven, and market-driven means that products are sold. They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized. Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user. It also has to be designed to be very affordable. But a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer, and use is what creates impact. And we believe that as designers, it holds us accountable to our customers. And with centralized manufacturing, you can control the quality control, and you can hit that $80 price point with profit margins built in. And now, those profit margins are critical, because if you want to scale, if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee, it needs to be economically sustainable.So I want to give you a sense of where we are at. We have fit over 5,000 amputees, and one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course, is, does it improve lives? Well, the standard is, is someone still wearing their knee six months later? The industry average is about 65 percent. Ours is 79 percent, and we're hoping to get that higher. Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries. This is where we want to get, though, in the next three years. We'll double the impact in 2015, and we'll double it each of the following years after that. But then we hit a new challenge, and that's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees.So I want to end with a story of Pournima. Pournima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg, and she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee, and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers, she's particularly meaningful to me  as an engineer and as a woman, because she was in school, she had just started school to study engineering. And she said, \"Well, now that I can walk again, I can go back and complete my studies.\" And to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users.So thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1895, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.560\nNine years ago, I worked\n\n00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.757\nfor the U.S. government in Iraq,\n\n00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:19.886\nhelping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.\n\n00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.523\nAnd I was there, and I worked in that job\n\n00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.373\nbecause I believe that technology\n\n00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:27.022\ncan improve people's lives.\n\n00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:29.957\nOne afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper\n\n00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:32.777\nat the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,\n\n00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:35.516\nand he said to me, \"You Americans,\n\n00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:36.867\nyou can put a man on the moon,\n\n00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:38.412\nbut when I get home tonight,\n\n00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.268\nI won't be able to turn on my lights.\"\n\n00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:42.925\nAt the time, the U.S. government had spent\n\n00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:45.285\nmore than two billion dollars\n\n00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.642\non electricity reconstruction.\n\n00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:50.814\nHow do you ensure technology reaches users?\n\n00:00:50.814 --> 00:00:52.794\nHow do you put it in their hands\n\n00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:55.030\nso that it is useful?\n\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.074\nSo those are the questions that my colleagues and I\n\n00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:00.187\nat D-Rev ask ourselves.\n\n00:01:00.187 --> 00:01:03.335\nAnd D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.\n\n00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.929\nAnd I took over the organization four years ago\n\n00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.230\nand really focused it on developing products\n\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.418\nthat actually reach users,\n\n00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:11.904\nand not just any users,\n\n00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:15.959\nbut customers who live on\nless than four dollars a day.\n\n00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.867\nOne of the key areas we've been working on recently\n\n00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:20.380\nis medical devices, and while it may not be obvious\n\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.512\nthat medical devices have something in common\n\n00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:25.078\nwith Iraq's electricity grid then,\n\n00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:27.207\nthere are some commonalities.\n\n00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:29.916\nDespite the advanced technology,\n\n00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:32.684\nit's not reaching the people who need it most.\n\n00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:35.092\nSo I'm going to tell you about one of\nthe projects we've been working on,\n\n00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.999\nthe ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee\n\n00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.155\nfor above-knee amputees.\n\n00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:43.455\nAnd this project started when\nthe Jaipur Foot Organization,\n\n00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:46.049\nthe largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,\n\n00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.518\ncame to the Bay Area and they said,\n\n00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:50.488\n\"We need a better knee.\"\n\n00:01:50.488 --> 00:01:53.636\nChances are, if you're living on\nless than four dollars a day,\n\n00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:55.513\nand you're an amputee,\n\n00:01:55.513 --> 00:01:57.687\nyou've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.\n\n00:01:57.687 --> 00:01:59.100\nMost people think it's land mines,\n\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.706\nbut it's a vehicle accident.\n\n00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:02.562\nYou're walking by the side of the road\n\n00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:03.986\nand you're hit by a truck,\n\n00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:05.847\nor you're trying to to jump on a moving train,\n\n00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:09.831\nyou're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.\n\n00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.996\nAnd the reality is that if\nyou don't have much money,\n\n00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:14.996\nlike this young named Kamal right here,\n\n00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:17.200\nthe option you really have\n\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.764\nis a bamboo staff to get around.\n\n00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.247\nAnd how big a problem is this?\n\n00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:25.173\nThere's over three million amputees every year\n\n00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:28.462\nwho need a new or replacement knee.\n\n00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:30.331\nAnd what are their options?\n\n00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.930\nThis is a high-end. This is\nwhat we'd call a \"smart knee.\"\n\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.948\nIt's got a microprocessor inside.\n\n00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:37.033\nIt can pretty much do anything,\n\n00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:38.730\nbut it's 20,000 dollars,\n\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.936\nand to give you a sense of who wears this,\n\n00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:44.179\nveterans, American veterans coming\nback from Afghanistan or Iraq\n\n00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:46.505\nwould be fit with something like this.\n\n00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:49.022\nThis is a low-end titanium knee.\n\n00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:51.499\nIt's a polycentric knee, and all that that means\n\n00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.708\nis the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,\n\n00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:56.258\nthat mimics a natural human knee.\n\n00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:58.661\nBut at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive\n\n00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:01.045\nfor people like Kamal.\n\n00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:03.638\nAnd lastly, here you see a low-end knee.\n\n00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:05.469\nThis is a knee that's been designed specifically\n\n00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.145\nfor poor people.\n\n00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.978\nAnd while you have affordability,\n\n00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:10.873\nyou've lost on functionality.\n\n00:03:10.873 --> 00:03:13.524\nThe mechanism here is a single axis,\n\n00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:15.773\nand a single axis is like a door hinge.\n\n00:03:15.773 --> 00:03:18.058\nSo you can think about how unstable that would be.\n\n00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:19.963\nAnd this is the type of mechanism\n\n00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:23.852\nthat the Jaipur Foot Organization was using\nwhen they were looking for a better knee,\n\n00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:26.209\nand I just wanted to give you a sense\nof what a leg system looks like,\n\n00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.548\nbecause I'm showing you all these knees\n\n00:03:27.548 --> 00:03:29.924\nand I imagine it's hard to think \nhow it all fits together.\n\n00:03:29.924 --> 00:03:31.966\nSo at the top you have a socket,\n\n00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:33.912\nand this fits over someone's residual limb,\n\n00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:36.472\nand everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.\n\n00:03:36.472 --> 00:03:37.656\nAnd then you have the knee,\n\n00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:39.374\nand here I've got a single axis on the knee\n\n00:03:39.374 --> 00:03:41.086\nso you can see how it rotates,\n\n00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:45.049\nand then a pylon, and then a foot.\n\n00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.592\nAnd we've been able to develop a knee,\n\n00:03:47.592 --> 00:03:49.954\na polycentric knee, so that type of knee\n\n00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:52.529\nthat acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,\n\n00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.272\nfor 80 dollars retail.\n\n00:03:55.272 --> 00:03:58.836\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:01.390\nBut the key is, you can have this great invention,\n\n00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.376\nyou can have this great design, but how do you get it\n\n00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.148\nto the people who most need it?\n\n00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:08.454\nHow do you ensure it gets to them\nand it improves their lives?\n\n00:04:08.454 --> 00:04:11.390\nSo at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,\n\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.774\nand we looked at three things that we really believe\n\n00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:17.746\ngets technologies to customers, to users,\n\n00:04:17.746 --> 00:04:19.122\nto people who need it.\n\n00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:21.843\nAnd the first thing is that the product \nneeds to be world class.\n\n00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:23.494\nIt needs to perform on par\n\n00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:26.339\nor better than the best products on the market.\n\n00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:28.485\nRegardless of your income level,\n\n00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:30.023\nyou want the most beautiful,\n\n00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:32.711\nthe best product that there is.\n\n00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.200\nI'm going to show you a video now\n\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.846\nof a man named Ash. You can see him walking.\n\n00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:39.758\nHe's wearing the same knee system here\n\n00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:41.364\nwith a single axis knee.\n\n00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.456\nAnd he's doing a 10-meter walk test.\n\n00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:47.271\nAnd you'll notice that he's struggling \nwith stability as he's walking.\n\n00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:49.926\nAnd something that's not obvious, that you can't see,\n\n00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:52.513\nis that it's psychologically draining\n\n00:04:52.513 --> 00:04:56.295\nto walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.\n\n00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:57.999\nNow this is a video of Kamal.\n\n00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.732\nYou remember Kamal earlier,\nholding the bamboo staff.\n\n00:05:00.732 --> 00:05:03.440\nHe's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,\n\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.540\nand he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.\n\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.956\nAnd you can see his stability is much better.\n\n00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:14.926\nSo world class isn't just about\ntechnical performance.\n\n00:05:14.926 --> 00:05:18.266\nIt's also about human performance.\n\n00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:20.124\nAnd most medical devices, we've learned,\n\n00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:22.652\nas we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,\n\n00:05:22.652 --> 00:05:24.315\nfor wealthier economies.\n\n00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:27.577\nBut the reality is our users, our customers,\n\n00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.130\nthey do different things. They sit cross-legged more.\n\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.972\nWe see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.\n\n00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:35.720\nAnd we designed our knee to have\nthe greatest range of motion\n\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.804\nof almost any other knee on the market.\n\n00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:41.534\nSo the second thing we learned, and this leads\n\n00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:43.794\ninto my second point, which is that we believe\n\n00:05:43.794 --> 00:05:46.511\nthat products need to be\ndesigned to be user-centric.\n\n00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.111\nAnd at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say\n\n00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:51.011\nyou need to be user-obsessed.\n\n00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.731\nSo it's not just the end user\nthat you're thinking about,\n\n00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:55.707\nbut everyone who interacts with the product,\n\n00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:58.421\nso, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,\n\n00:05:58.421 --> 00:06:01.589\nbut also the context in which the knee is being fit.\n\n00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.173\nWhat is the local market like?\n\n00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:05.091\nHow do all these components get to the clinic?\n\n00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.413\nDo they all get there on time? The supply chain.\n\n00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:09.516\nEverything that goes into ensuring\n\n00:06:09.516 --> 00:06:11.499\nthat this product gets to the end user,\n\n00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:15.920\nand it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.\n\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.786\nSo I wanted to show you some of the iterations\n\n00:06:17.786 --> 00:06:22.379\nwe did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,\n\n00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.200\nso this is it right here.\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.926\n(Clicking)\n\n00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:28.144\nNotice anything about it?\n\n00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:30.705\nIt clicks.\n\n00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:33.571\nWe'd seen that users had actually modified it.\n\n00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:37.083\nSo do you see that black strip right there?\n\n00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:40.075\nThat's a homemade noise dampener.\n\n00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:42.293\nWe also saw that our users had modified it\n\n00:06:42.293 --> 00:06:43.727\nin other ways.\n\n00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:45.517\nYou can see there that that particular amputee,\n\n00:06:45.517 --> 00:06:47.746\nhe had wrapped bandages around the knee.\n\n00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:49.470\nHe'd made a cosmesis.\n\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.666\nAnd if you look at the knee,\n\n00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:55.120\nit's got those pointy edges, right?\n\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.323\nSo if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt\n\n00:06:57.323 --> 00:06:59.583\nor a sari, it's really obvious\n\n00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:01.179\nthat you're wearing a prosthetic limb,\n\n00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:05.371\nand in societies where there's social\nstigma around being disabled,\n\n00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:08.328\npeople are particularly acute about this.\n\n00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:10.644\nSo I'm going to show you some\nof the modifications we did.\n\n00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:13.559\nWe did a lot of iterations, not just \naround this, but some other things.\n\n00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:15.987\nBut here we have the version three, \nthe ReMotion Knee,\n\n00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:17.806\nbut if you look in here, you can see\n\n00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:22.524\nthe noise dampener. It's quieter.\n\n00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:26.177\nThe other thing we did is that\nwe smoothed the profile.\n\n00:07:26.177 --> 00:07:27.609\nWe made it thinner.\n\n00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:29.317\nAnd something that's not obvious is that we\n\n00:07:29.317 --> 00:07:32.518\ndesigned it for mass production.\n\n00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.214\nAnd this goes into my last point.\n\n00:07:34.214 --> 00:07:36.185\nWe really, truly believe that if a product\n\n00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:38.522\nis going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,\n\n00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:40.357\nit needs to be market-driven,\n\n00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:43.602\nand market-driven means that products are sold.\n\n00:07:43.602 --> 00:07:46.725\nThey're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.\n\n00:07:46.725 --> 00:07:48.938\nOur product needs to be designed to offer value\n\n00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:50.239\nto the end user.\n\n00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:52.418\nIt also has to be designed to be very affordable.\n\n00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:54.592\nBut a product that is valued by a customer\n\n00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:56.303\nis used by a customer,\n\n00:07:56.303 --> 00:07:58.476\nand use is what creates impact.\n\n00:07:58.476 --> 00:08:00.235\nAnd we believe that as designers,\n\n00:08:00.235 --> 00:08:03.465\nit holds us accountable to our customers.\n\n00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:06.081\nAnd with centralized manufacturing,\n\n00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:08.108\nyou can control the quality control,\n\n00:08:08.108 --> 00:08:09.836\nand you can hit that $80 price point\n\n00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:12.326\nwith profit margins built in.\n\n00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:14.482\nAnd now, those profit margins are critical,\n\n00:08:14.482 --> 00:08:16.151\nbecause if you want to scale, if you want to reach\n\n00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.410\nall the people in the world who possibly need a knee,\n\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.567\nit needs to be economically sustainable.\n\n00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:24.163\nSo I want to give you a sense of where we are at.\n\n00:08:24.163 --> 00:08:27.739\nWe have fit over 5,000 amputees,\n\n00:08:27.739 --> 00:08:29.958\nand one of the big indicators\nwe're looking at, of course,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.871\nis, does it improve lives?\n\n00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:33.607\nWell, the standard is, is someone\n\n00:08:33.607 --> 00:08:36.132\nstill wearing their knee six months later?\n\n00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.835\nThe industry average is about 65 percent.\n\n00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:41.127\nOurs is 79 percent,\n\n00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:44.071\nand we're hoping to get that higher.\n\n00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:47.084\nRight now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.\n\n00:08:47.084 --> 00:08:48.694\nThis is where we want to get, though,\n\n00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.212\nin the next three years.\n\n00:08:50.212 --> 00:08:52.712\nWe'll double the impact in 2015,\n\n00:08:52.712 --> 00:08:55.830\nand we'll double it each of\nthe following years after that.\n\n00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.663\nBut then we hit a new challenge,\n\n00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:59.682\nand that's the number of skilled prosthetists\n\n00:08:59.682 --> 00:09:02.790\nwho are able to fit knees.\n\n00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.471\nSo I want to end with a story of Pournima.\n\n00:09:05.471 --> 00:09:07.118\nPournima was 18 years old\n\n00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:09.986\nwhen she was in a car accident\nwhere she lost her leg,\n\n00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:13.427\nand she traveled 12 hours by train\n\n00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:15.854\nto come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,\n\n00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:18.447\nand while all of the amputees who wear our knees\n\n00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:20.623\naffect us as the designers,\n\n00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:24.890\nshe's particularly meaningful to me \nas an engineer and as a woman,\n\n00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.454\nbecause she was in school,\n\n00:09:26.454 --> 00:09:29.178\nshe had just started school to study engineering.\n\n00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:31.333\nAnd she said, \"Well, now that I can walk again,\n\n00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:33.741\nI can go back and complete my studies.\"\n\n00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:36.911\nAnd to me she represents the next generation\n\n00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:39.943\nof engineers solving problems\n\n00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:42.388\nand ensuring meaningful technologies\n\n00:09:42.388 --> 00:09:44.172\nreach their users.\n\n00:09:44.172 --> 00:09:46.210\nSo thank you.\n\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.014\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Does money make you mean?", "duration": "995", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_piff_does_money_make_you_mean", "transcript": "I want you to, for a moment, think about playing a game of Monopoly. Except in this game, that combination of skill, talent and luck that helped earn you success in games, as in life, has been rendered irrelevant, because this game's been rigged, and you've got the upper hand. You've got more money, more opportunities to move around the board, and more access to resources. And as you think about that experience, I want you to ask yourself: How might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way you think about yourself and regard that other player?So, we ran a study on the UC Berkeley campus to look at exactly that question. We brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab, and with the flip of a coin, randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game. They got two times as much money; when they passed Go, they collected twice the salary; and they got to roll both dice instead of one, so they got to move around the board a lot more.(Laughter)And over the course of 15 minutes, we watched through hidden cameras what happened. What I want to do today, for the first time, is show you a little bit of what we saw. You'll to have to pardon the sound quality, because again, these were hidden cameras. So we've provided subtitles.[Video] Rich Player: How many 500s did you have?Poor Player: Just one.RP: Are you serious? PP: Yeah.RP: I have three. (Laughs) I don't know why they gave me so much.Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparent to players that something was up. One person clearly has a lot more money than the other person, and yet, as the game unfolded, we saw very notable differences, dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players. The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with the piece as he went around.(Game piece smacks board)We were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs, displays of power and celebration among the rich players.We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side. It's on the bottom right corner. That allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior. So we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat.[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick?PP: I don't know.Paul Piff: OK, so no surprises, people are on to us. They wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place. One even asks, like you just saw, \"Is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick?\" And yet, despite that, the power of the situation seems to inevitably dominate, and those rich players start to eat more pretzels.(Laughter)[Video] RP: I love pretzels.(Laughter)Paul Piff: And as the game went on, one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person \u2014 less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor, poor players, and more and more demonstrative of their material success, more likely to showcase how well they're doing.[Video] RP: I have money ...(Laughs) I have money for everything.PP: How much is that?RP: You owe me 24 dollars. You're going to lose all your money soon. I'll buy it. I have so much money. I have so much money, it takes me forever.RP 2: I'm going to buy out this whole board.RP 3: You're going to run out of money soon. I'm pretty much untouchable at this point.(Laughter)Paul Piff: And here's what I think was really, really interesting: it's that, at the end of the 15 minutes, we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game. And when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly ...(Laughter)They talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game.(Laughter)And they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation \u2014 including that flip of a coin \u2014 that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. And that's a really, really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage.Now, this game of Monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure, wherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status, and a lot of people don't; they have a lot less wealth and a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources. And what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies. What we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person's levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and empathy go down, and their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness, and their ideology of self-interest increase. In surveys, we've found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good, and that the pursuit of self-interest is favorable and moral. Now, what I want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self-interest, talk about why we should care about those implications, and end with what might be done.Some of the first studies that we ran in this area looked at helping behavior, something social psychologists call \"pro-social behavior.\" And we were really interested in who's more likely to offer help to another person: someone who's rich or someone who's poor. In one of the studies, we bring rich and poor members of the community into the lab, and give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars. We told the participants they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves, or they could share a portion of it, if they wanted to, with a stranger, who's totally anonymous. They'll never meet that stranger; the stranger will never meet them. And we just monitor how much people give. Individuals who made 25,000, sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year, gave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making 150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.We've had people play games to see who's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize. In one of the games, we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain score were impossible \u2014 You couldn't get above 12 in this game, and yet ... the richer you were, the more likely you were to cheat in this game to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize \u2014 sometimes by three to four times as much.We ran another study where we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children \u2014(Laughter)I'm not kidding \u2014 I know it sounds like I'm making a joke. We explicitly told participants: \"This candy is for children participating in a developmental lab nearby. They're in studies. This is for them.\" And we just monitored how much candy participants took. Participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor.We've even studied cars. Not just any cars, but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law. In one of these studies, we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk. Now in California, as you all know, because I'm sure we all do this, it's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross. So here's an example of how we did it. That's our confederate off to the left, posing as a pedestrian. He approaches as the red truck successfully stops. In typical California fashion, it's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.(Laughter)Now here's an example of a more expensive car, a Prius, driving through, and a BMW doing the same. So we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days, just tracking who stops and who doesn't. What we found was as the expensiveness of a car increased ...(Laughter)the drivers' tendencies to break the law increased as well. None of the cars \u2014 none of the cars \u2014 in our least expensive car category broke the law. Close to 50 percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category broke the law. We've run other studies, finding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations, to endorse unethical behavior at work, like stealing cash from the cash register, taking bribes, lying to customers.Now, I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior. Not at all \u2014 in fact, I think that we all, in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives, struggle with these competing motivations of when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people. And that's understandable, because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper, as long as we apply ourselves and work hard. And a piece of that means that sometimes, you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you. But what we're finding is that the wealthier you are, the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success, of achievement and accomplishment, to the detriment of others around you.Here I've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last 20 years. In 1993, the differences between the different quintiles of the population, in terms of income, are fairly egregious. It's not difficult to discern that there are differences. But over the last 20 years, that significant difference has become a Grand Canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else. In fact, the top 20 percent of our population own close to 90 percent of the total wealth in this country.We're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality. What that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals, but the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us. And if it's the case, as we've been finding, that the wealthier you are, the more entitled you feel to that wealth, and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people, and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest, well, then, there's no reason to think that those patterns will change. In fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse, and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same, at the same linear rate, over the next 20 years.Now inequality \u2014 economic inequality \u2014 is something we should all be concerned about, and not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy, but because individuals and groups with lots of economic inequality do worse ... not just the people at the bottom, everyone. There's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world, showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse. Social mobility, things we really care about, physical health, social trust, all go down as inequality goes up. Similarly, negative things in social collectives and societies, things like obesity, and violence, imprisonment, and punishment, are exacerbated as economic inequality increases. Again, these are outcomes not just experienced by a few, but that resound across all strata of society. Even people at the top experience these outcomes.So what do we do? This cascade of self-perpetuating, pernicious, negative effects could seem like something that's spun out of control, and there's nothing we can do about it, certainly nothing we as individuals could do. But in fact, we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions, can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. For instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people.In one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them. And after watching that, we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab, who was in distress. After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor, suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical, but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values, and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy.And beyond the walls of our lab, we're even beginning to see signs of change in society. Bill Gates, one of our nation's wealthiest individuals, in his Harvard commencement speech, talked about the problem of inequality facing society as being the most daunting challenge, and talked about what must be done to combat it, saying, \"Humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries \u2014 but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.\" And there's the Giving Pledge, in which more than 100 of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity. And there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements, like \"We are the 1 percent,\" \"Resource Generation,\" or \"Wealth for Common Good,\" in which the most privileged members of the population, members of the one percent and elsewhere, people who are wealthy, are using their own economic resources, adults and youth alike \u2014 that's what's most striking to me \u2014 leveraging their own privilege, their own economic resources, to combat inequality by advocating for social policies, changes in social values and changes in people's behavior that work against their own economic interests, but that may ultimately restore the American dream.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1897, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:15.386\nI want you to, for a moment,\n\n00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.480\nthink about playing a game of Monopoly.\n\n00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:24.466\nExcept in this game,\nthat combination of skill, talent and luck\n\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.245\nthat helped earn you success\nin games, as in life,\n\n00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.670\nhas been rendered irrelevant,\n\n00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.850\nbecause this game's been rigged,\n\n00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:32.349\nand you've got the upper hand.\n\n00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:34.537\nYou've got more money,\n\n00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.098\nmore opportunities to move\naround the board,\n\n00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.864\nand more access to resources.\n\n00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:41.226\nAnd as you think about that experience,\n\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.676\nI want you to ask yourself:\n\n00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:48.110\nHow might that experience of being\na privileged player in a rigged game\n\n00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:50.428\nchange the way you think about yourself\n\n00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:53.538\nand regard that other player?\n\n00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:57.953\nSo, we ran a study\non the UC Berkeley campus\n\n00:00:57.977 --> 00:01:00.217\nto look at exactly that question.\n\n00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.934\nWe brought in more than 100 pairs\nof strangers into the lab,\n\n00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:06.529\nand with the flip of a coin,\n\n00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:10.594\nrandomly assigned one of the two\nto be a rich player in a rigged game.\n\n00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:12.364\nThey got two times as much money;\n\n00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.519\nwhen they passed Go,\nthey collected twice the salary;\n\n00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:19.578\nand they got to roll\nboth dice instead of one,\n\n00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.896\nso they got to move\naround the board a lot more.\n\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.526\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:25.684\nAnd over the course of 15 minutes,\n\n00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:28.199\nwe watched through\nhidden cameras what happened.\n\n00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:31.311\nWhat I want to do today,\nfor the first time,\n\n00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:33.483\nis show you a little bit of what we saw.\n\n00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:35.808\nYou'll to have to pardon\nthe sound quality,\n\n00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:37.805\nbecause again, these were hidden cameras.\n\n00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.514\nSo we've provided subtitles.\n\n00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.224\n[Video] Rich Player: How many\n500s did you have?\n\n00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:43.399\nPoor Player: Just one.\n\n00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:44.843\nRP: Are you serious?\nPP: Yeah.\n\n00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:47.998\nRP: I have three.

asked the players to talk\nabout their experience during the game.\n\n00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:14.691\nAnd when the rich players talked\nabout why they had inevitably won\n\n00:04:14.715 -->

feelings of entitlement,\nof deservingness,\n\n00:05:38.746 --> 00:05:42.306\nand their ideology\nof self-interest increase.\n\n00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.835\nIn surveys, we've found\n\n00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:48.722\nthat it's actually wealthier individuals\nwho are more likely to moralize\n\n00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:50.453\ngreed being good,\n\n00:05:50.477 --> 00:05:54.445\nand that the pursuit of self-interest\nis favorable and moral.\n\n00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.651\nNow, what I want to do today\nis talk about some of the implications\n\n00:05:58.675 --> 00:06:00.570\nof this ideology

00:06:09.940\nSome of the first studies\nthat we ran in this area\n\n00:06:09.964 --> 00:06:11.300\nlooked at helping behavior,\n\n00:06:11.324 --> 00:06:14.531\nsomething social psychologists\ncall \"pro-social behavior.\"\n\n00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.860\nAnd we were really interested\n\n00:06:16.884 --> 00:06:20.285\nin who's more likely\nto offer help to another person:\n\n00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:22.632\nsomeone who's rich or someone who's poor.\n\n00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:24.781\nIn one of the studies,\n\n00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:30.235\nwe bring rich and poor members\nof the community into the lab,\n\n00:06:30.347 --> 00:06:33.171\nand give each of them\nthe equivalent of 10 dollars.\n\n00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.955\nWe told the participants they could keep\nthese 10 dollars for themselves,\n\n00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.867\nor they could share\na portion of it, if they wanted to,\n\n00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:43.235\nwith a stranger, who's totally anonymous.\n\n00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.516\nThey'll never meet that stranger;\nthe stranger will never meet them.\n\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.790\nAnd we just monitor how much people give.\n\n00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:54.161\nIndividuals who made 25,000,\nsometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,\n\n00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:57.502\ngave 44 percent more\nof their money to the stranger\n\n00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:01.231\nthan did individuals making\n150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.\n\n00:07:02.941 --> 00:07:04.978\nWe've had people play games\n\n00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:08.433\nto see who's more or less likely to cheat\n\n00:07:08.457 --> 00:07:10.811\nto increase their chances\nof winning a prize.\n\n00:07:10.835 --> 00:07:13.584\nIn one of the games,\nwe actually rigged a computer\n\n00:07:13.608

00:07:25.711\nthe richer you were, the more likely\nyou were to cheat in this game\n\n00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:28.460\nto earn credits toward a $50 cash prize --\n\n00:07:29.104 --> 00:07:31.342\nsometimes by three to four times as much.\n\n00:07:33.064 --> 00:07:34.228\nWe ran another study\n\n00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:38.043\nwhere we looked at whether people\nwould be inclined to take candy\n\n00:07:38.432 --> 00:07:41.072\nfrom a jar of candy\nthat we explicitly identified\n\n00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:42.976\nas being reserved for children --\n\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.596\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.774\nI'm not kidding -- I know it sounds\nlike I'm making a joke.\n\n00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.409\nWe explicitly told

This is for them.\"\n\n00:07:59.943 --> 00:08:02.867\nAnd we just monitored\nhow much candy participants took.\n\n00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.440\nParticipants who felt rich\ntook two times as much

--> 00:08:17.230\nbut whether drivers\nof different kinds of cars\n\n00:08:17.254 --> 00:08:20.272\nare more or less inclined\nto break the law.\n\n00:08:20.296 --> 00:08:21.808\nIn one of these studies,\n\n00:08:22.516 --> 00:08:27.243\nwe looked at whether drivers\nwould stop for a pedestrian\n\n00:08:27.267 --> 00:08:30.127\nthat we had posed waiting\nto cross at a crosswalk.\n\n00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:31.999\nNow in California, as you all know,\n\n00:08:32.023 --> 00:08:34.427\nbecause I'm sure we all do this,\n\n00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.972\nit's the law to stop for a pedestrian\nwho's waiting to cross.\n\n00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:40.234\nSo here's an example of how we did it.\n\n00:08:40.258 --> 00:08:43.801\nThat's our confederate off to the left,\nposing as a pedestrian.\n\n00:08:43.825 --> 00:08:47.807\nHe approaches as the red truck\nsuccessfully stops.\n\n00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:49.956\nIn typical California fashion,\n\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.949\nit's overtaken by the bus\nwho almost runs our pedestrian over.\n\n00:08:52.973 --> 00:08:54.326\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.555\nNow here's an example\nof a more

00:09:08.446\non several days,\n\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.894\njust tracking who stops and who doesn't.\n\n00:09:12.545 --> 00:09:16.798\nWhat we found was as the expensiveness\nof a car increased ...\n\n00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.894\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:22.149\nthe drivers' tendencies\nto break the law increased as well.\n\n00:09:22.173 --> 00:09:24.974\nNone of the cars -- none of the cars --\n\n00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:28.069\nin our least expensive car category\n\n00:09:28.093 --> 00:09:29.251\nbroke the law.\n\n00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:34.594\nClose to 50 percent of the cars\nin our most expensive vehicle category\n\n00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:35.817\nbroke the law.\n\n00:09:37.508 --> 00:09:38.756\nWe've run other studies,\n\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.667\nfinding that wealthier individuals\nare more likely to lie in negotiations,\n\n00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:44.882\nto endorse unethical behavior at work,\n\n00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:47.506\nlike stealing cash from the cash register,\n\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.409\ntaking bribes, lying to customers.\n\n00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:54.248\nNow, I don't mean to suggest\n\n00:09:54.272 --> 00:09:57.846\nthat it's only wealthy people\nwho show these patterns of behavior.\n\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.676\nNot at all -- in fact,\nI think that we all,\n\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.619\nin our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,\n\n00:10:03.643 --> 00:10:06.492\nstruggle with these competing motivations\n\n00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:12.207\nof when or if to put our own interests\nabove the interests of other people.\n\n00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:14.507\nAnd that's understandable,\n\n00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.428\nbecause the American dream is an idea\n\n00:10:17.452 --> 00:10:22.287\nin which we all have an equal opportunity\nto succeed and prosper,\n\n00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:24.867\nas long as we apply\nourselves and work hard.\n\n00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:27.600\nAnd a piece of that means that sometimes,\n\n00:10:27.624 --> 00:10:30.553\nyou need to put your own interests\n\n00:10:30.577 --> 00:10:34.086\nabove the interests and well-being\nof other people around you.\n\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.481\nBut what we're finding\nis that the wealthier you are,\n\n00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:41.345\nthe more likely you are to pursue\na vision of personal success,\n\n00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:43.694\nof achievement and accomplishment,\n\n00:10:43.718 --> 00:10:45.906\nto the detriment of others around you.\n\n00:10:46.885 --> 00:10:50.158\nHere I've plotted for you\nthe mean household income\n\n00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:53.418\nreceived by each fifth\nand top five percent of the population\n\n00:10:53.442 --> 00:10:54.870\nover the last 20 years.\n\n00:10:55.537 --> 00:10:56.771\nIn 1993,\n\n00:10:56.795 --> 00:10:59.921\nthe differences between the different\nquintiles of the population,\n\n00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:01.133\nin terms of income,\n\n00:11:01.157 --> 00:11:03.229\nare fairly egregious.\n\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.380\nIt's not difficult to discern\nthat there are differences.\n\n00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:09.233\nBut over the last 20 years,\nthat significant difference\n\n00:11:09.257 --> 00:11:11.549\nhas become a Grand Canyon of sorts\n\n00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:14.597\nbetween those at the top\nand everyone else.\n\n00:11:14.621 --> 00:11:18.255\nIn fact, the top 20 percent\nof our population\n\n00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:21.378\nown close to 90 percent\nof the total wealth in this country.\n\n00:11:21.402 --> 00:11:25.081\nWe're at unprecedented levels\nof economic inequality.\n\n00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:31.657\nWhat that means is that wealth is not only\nbecoming increasingly concentrated\n\n00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:34.615\nin the hands of a select group\nof individuals,\n\n00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:38.967\nbut the American dream\nis becoming increasingly unattainable\n\n00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:41.333\nfor an increasing majority of us.\n\n00:11:42.185 --> 00:11:44.984\nAnd if it's the case,\nas we've been finding,\n\n00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:46.457\nthat the wealthier you are,\n\n00:11:46.481 --> 00:11:49.000\nthe more entitled you feel to that wealth,\n\n00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:52.022\nand the more likely you are\nto prioritize your own interests\n\n00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:53.802\nabove the interests of other people,\n\n00:11:53.826 --> 00:11:57.351\nand be willing to do things\nto serve that self-interest,\n\n00:11:57.375 --> 00:12:01.042\nwell, then, there's no reason to think\nthat those patterns will change.\n\n00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:04.598\nIn fact, there's every reason\nto think that they'll only get worse,\n\n00:12:04.622 --> 00:12:07.808\nand that's what it would look like\nif things just stayed the same,\n\n00:12:07.832 --> 00:12:10.890\nat the same linear rate,\nover the next 20 years.\n\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.860\nNow inequality -- economic inequality --\n\n00:12:14.884 --> 00:12:17.083\nis something we should\nall be concerned about,\n\n00:12:17.107 --> 00:12:20.710\nand not just because of those\nat the bottom of the social hierarchy,\n\n00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:23.078\nbut because individuals and groups\n\n00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:27.575\nwith lots of economic\ninequality do worse ...\n\n00:12:28.307 --> 00:12:30.601\nnot just the people\nat the bottom, everyone.\n\n00:12:31.164 --> 00:12:33.231\nThere's a lot of really\ncompelling research\n\n00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:35.915\ncoming out from top labs\nall over the world,\n\n00:12:35.939 --> 00:12:40.589\nshowcasing the range of things\nthat are undermined\n\n00:12:40.613 --> 00:12:43.129\nas economic inequality gets worse.\n\n00:12:43.153 --> 00:12:45.982\nSocial mobility,\nthings we really care about,\n\n00:12:46.006 --> 00:12:48.464\nphysical health, social trust,\n\n00:12:48.488 --> 00:12:51.420\nall go down as inequality goes up.\n\n00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:55.969\nSimilarly, negative things\nin social collectives and societies,\n\n00:12:55.993 --> 00:12:58.073\nthings like obesity, and violence,\n\n00:12:58.097 --> 00:12:59.695\nimprisonment, and punishment,\n\n00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:03.845\nare exacerbated as economic\ninequality increases.\n\n00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:07.412\nAgain, these are outcomes\nnot just experienced by a few,\n\n00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:10.874\nbut that resound\nacross all strata of society.\n\n00:13:10.898 --> 00:13:13.558\nEven people at the top\nexperience these outcomes.\n\n00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:16.114\nSo what do we do?\n\n00:13:17.265 --> 00:13:20.847\nThis cascade of self-perpetuating,\n\n00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:23.356\npernicious, negative effects\n\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.776\ncould seem like something\nthat's spun out of control,\n\n00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.688\nand there's nothing we can do about it,\n\n00:13:28.712 --> 00:13:30.967\ncertainly nothing\nwe as individuals could do.\n\n00:13:31.516 --> 00:13:37.605\nBut in fact, we've been finding\nin our own laboratory research\n\n00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:43.058\nthat small psychological interventions,\n\n00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:46.672\nsmall changes to people's values,\n\n00:13:46.789 --> 00:13:50.146\nsmall nudges in certain directions,\n\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.304\ncan restore levels\nof egalitarianism and empathy.\n\n00:13:53.717 --> 00:13:57.990\nFor instance, reminding people\nof the benefits of cooperation\n\n00:13:58.014 --> 00:13:59.909\nor the advantages of community,\n\n00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:04.731\ncause wealthier individuals\nto be just as egalitarian\n\n00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:06.080\nas poor people.\n\n00:14:07.327 --> 00:14:12.852\nIn one study, we had people watch\na brief video, just 46 seconds long,\n\n00:14:12.876 --> 00:14:14.294\nabout childhood poverty\n\n00:14:15.102 --> 00:14:19.303\nthat served as a reminder of the needs\nof others in the world around them.\n\n00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:22.110\nAnd after watching that,\n\n00:14:22.134 --> 00:14:25.590\nwe looked at how willing people\nwere to offer up their own time\n\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.231\nto a stranger presented to them\nin the lab, who was in distress.\n\n00:14:30.984 --> 00:14:34.204\nAfter watching this video, an hour later,\n\n00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:37.608\nrich people became\njust as generous of their own time\n\n00:14:37.632 --> 00:14:39.778\nto help out this other person, a stranger,\n\n00:14:39.802 --> 00:14:41.247\nas someone who's poor,\n\n00:14:41.271 --> 00:14:45.529\nsuggesting that these differences\nare not innate or categorical,\n\n00:14:45.553 --> 00:14:49.309\nbut are so malleable\nto slight changes in people's values,\n\n00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:52.741\nand little nudges of compassion\nand bumps of empathy.\n\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.707\nAnd beyond the walls of our lab,\n\n00:14:54.731 --> 00:14:58.010\nwe're even beginning to see\nsigns of change in society.\n\n00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:01.999\nBill Gates, one of our nation's\nwealthiest individuals,\n\n00:15:02.023 --> 00:15:03.951\nin his Harvard commencement speech,\n\n00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:06.836\ntalked about the problem\nof inequality facing society\n\n00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.523\nas being the most daunting challenge,\n\n00:15:09.547 --> 00:15:12.381\nand talked about what must\nbe done to combat it,\n\n00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:17.423\nsaying, \"Humanity's greatest advances\nare not in its discoveries --\n\n00:15:17.447 --> 00:15:20.479\nbut in how those discoveries are applied\n\n00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.291\nto reduce inequity.\"\n\n00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:25.243\nAnd there's the Giving Pledge,\n\n00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:29.194\nin which more than 100\nof our nation's wealthiest individuals\n\n00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:33.217\nare pledging half\nof their fortunes to charity.\n\n00:15:33.844 --> 00:15:38.316\nAnd there's the emergence of dozens\nof grassroots movements,\n\n00:15:39.094 --> 00:15:40.847\nlike \"We are the 1 percent,\"\n\n00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:42.949\n\"Resource Generation,\"\n\n00:15:43.514

"transcript": "It's the fifth time I stand on this shore, the Cuban shore, looking out at that distant horizon, believing, again, that I'm going to make it all the way across that vast, dangerous wilderness of an ocean. Not only have I tried four times, but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950, and it's still never been done.The team is proud of our four attempts. It's an expedition of some 30 people. Bonnie is my best friend and head handler, who somehow summons will, that last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone, after many, many hours and days out there. The shark experts are the best in the world \u2014 large predators below. The box jellyfish, the deadliest venom in all of the ocean, is in these waters, and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt. The conditions themselves, besides the sheer distance of over 100 miles in the open ocean \u2014 the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself, the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth.And by the way \u2014 it's amusing to me that journalists and people, before these attempts, often ask me, \"Well, are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything?\"(Laughter)And I'm thinking, what are they imagining? That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation \u2014(Laughter)And carry a bowie knife in my mouth, and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them, and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water.(Laughter)Yes, I have a team.(Laughter)And the team is expert, and the team is courageous, and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery, as is true of any major expedition on the planet.And we've been on a journey. And the debate has raged, hasn't it, since the Greeks, of isn't it what it's all about? Isn't life about the journey, not really the destination? And here we've been on this journey, and the truth is, it's been thrilling. We haven't reached that other shore, and still, our sense of pride and commitment, unwavering commitment. When I turned 60, the dream was still alive from having tried this in my 20s \u2014 dreamed it and imagined it. The most famous body of water on the Earth today, I imagine, Cuba to Florida. And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.When I turned 60, it wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment, it wasn't the ego of \"I want to be the first.\" That's always there and it's undeniable. But it was deeper. It was \"how much life is there left?\" Let's face it \u2014 we're all on a one-way street, aren't we? And what are we going to do? What are we going to do as we go forward, to have no regrets looking back? And all this past year in training, I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote to paraphrase it, floating around in my brain. It says, \"You go ahead. You go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic, you be the observer, while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again, but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way.\"And so of course I want to make it across. It is the goal, and I should be so shallow to say that this year, the destination was even sweeter than the journey.(Laughter)(Applause)But the journey itself was worthwhile taking. And at this point, by this summer, everybody \u2014 scientists, sports scientists, endurance experts, neurologists, my own team, Bonnie \u2014 said it's impossible. It just simply can't be done, and Bonnie said to me, \"But if you're going to take the journey, I'm going to see you through to the end of it, so I'll be there.\"And now we're there. As we're looking out, kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke, standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway, the Cuban flag is flying above, all my team is out in their boats, hands up in the air, \"We're here! We're here for you!\" Bonnie and I look at each other and say, this year, the mantra is \u2014 and I've been using it in training \u2014 Find a way. You have a dream and you have obstacles in front of you, as we all do. None of us ever get through this life without heartache, without turmoil, and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality, you find your way. And Bonnie grabbed my shoulders, and she said, \"Let's find our way to Florida.\"And we started, and for the next 53 hours, it was an intense, unforgettable life experience. The highs were high, the awe \u2014 I'm not a religious person, but I'll tell you, to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream as if, as you're breathing, you're looking down miles and miles and miles, to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on \u2014 it's awe-inspiring. I have a playlist of about 85 songs, and especially in the middle of the night ... That night, because we use no lights \u2014 lights attract jellyfish, lights attract sharks, lights attract baitfish that attract sharks, so we go in the pitch black of the night. You've never seen black this black. You can't see the front of your hand, and the people on the boat, Bonnie and my team on the boat \u2014 they just hear the slapping of the arms, and they know where I am, because there's no visual at all. And I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist.(Laughter)I've got tight rubber caps, I don't hear a thing. I've got goggles and I'm turning my head 50 times a minute, and I'm singing ...(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven(Laughter)doo doo doo doo doo It's easy if you try doo doo doo doo dooAnd I can sing that song a thousand times in a row.(Laughter)Now there's a talent unto itself.(Laughter)(Applause)And each time I get done with,(Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one222.(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven(Laughter)And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ... exactly.(Laughter)And then there are the crises. Of course there are. And the vomiting starts, the seawater \u2014 you're not well. You're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection. It's difficult to swim in. It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth, but the tentacles can't get you. And the hypothermia sets in. The water's 85 degrees, and yet you're losing weight and using calories. And as you come over toward the side of the boat \u2014 not allowed to touch it, not allowed to get out, but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and ask me how I'm doing, am I all right. I am seeing the Taj Mahal \u2014(Laughter)Over here. I'm in a very different state \u2014(Laughter)And I'm thinking, \"Wow! I never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here. It's gorgeous! I mean, how long did it take them to build that? It's just ... So, uh \u2014 wooo \u2014 you know?(Laughter)We kind of have a cardinal rule that I'm never told how far it is, because we don't know how far it is. What's going to happen to you between this point and that point? What's going to happen to the weather and the currents and, God forbid, you're stung, when you don't think you could be stung in all this armor. Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering, and I was hanging on by a thread. And she said, \"Come here,\" and I came close to the boat, and she said, \"Look, look out there.\" And I saw light, because the day is easier than the night, and I thought we were coming into day. I saw a stream of white light along the horizon, and I said, \"It's going to be morning soon.\" And she said, \"No, those are the lights of Key West.\" It was 15 more hours, which for most swimmers would be a long time.(Laughter)(Applause)You have no idea how many 15-hour training swims I had done.So here we go, and I somehow, without a decision, went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking on the parameters of the universe. I just went into thinking about this dream, and why and how. As I said, when I turned 60, it wasn't about that concrete \"Can you do it?\" That's the everyday machinations. That's the discipline, and it's the preparation, and there's a pride in that. But I decided to think, as I went along, about \u2014 you know, the phrase usually is, \"reaching for the stars.\" And in my case, it's reaching for the horizon. And when you reach for the horizon, as I've proven, you may not get there. But what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you lay down; what a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons.And now, the shore is coming. And there's just a little part of me that's sad. The epic journey is going to be over.So many people come up to me now and say, \"What's next?\"(Laughter)\"We love that!\"(Laughter)\"That little tracker on the computer? When are you going to do the next one? We can't wait to follow the next one.\" Well, they were just there for 53 hours, and I was there for years. And so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean.But the point is, and the point was, that every day of our lives is epic. And I'll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach, staggered up onto that beach ... I had so many times, in a very puffed-up ego way, rehearsed what I would say ...(Laughter)on the beach. When Bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up, she brought the medical team over to our boat to say, \"She's really beginning to have trouble breathing; another 12, 24 hours in the saltwater ...\" \u2014 the whole thing \u2014 I just thought, in my hallucinatory moment, that I heard the word \"tracheotomy.\"(Laughter)Bonnie said to the doctor, \"I'm not worried about her not breathing. If she can't talk when she gets to the shore, she's going to be pissed off.\"(Laughter)But the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced, just to get myself through some training swims as motivation \u2014 it wasn't like that. It was a very real moment, with that crowd, with my team. We did it. I didn't do it. We did it. And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us.The three things I did sort of blurt out when we got there, was first: Never, ever give up. I live it. What's the phrase from today from Socrates?Audience: To be is to do.Diana Nyad: To be is to do. So I don't stand up and say, \"Don't ever give up.\" I didn't give up. There was action behind these words.The second is: You can chase your dreams at any age; you're never too old. Sixty-four; a thing no one, at any age, any gender, could ever do has done it. And there's no doubt in my mind that I am at the prime of my life today.(Applause)Yeah.(Applause)Thank you.And the third thing I said on that beach was, it looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world, and in many ways, of course, it is. And in other ways, and the most important ways, it's a team. And if you think I'm a badass, you want to meet Bonnie.(Laughter)Bonnie, where are you? Where are you? There's Bonnie Stoll.(Applause)My buddy.(Applause)The Henry David Thoreau quote goes, \"When you achieve your dreams, it's not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them.\" And yeah, I stand before you now. In the three months since that swim ended, I've sat down with Oprah, and I've been in President Obama's Oval Office; I've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves; I've signed a wonderful major book contract. All of that's great, and I don't denigrate it. I'm proud of it all, but the truth is, I'm walking around tall because I am that bold, fearless person, and I will be, every day, until it's time for these days to be done.Thank you very much and enjoy the conference.Thank you. Thank you!(Applause)Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you.(Applause)Find a way!(Applause)", "id": 1896, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:20.302\nIt's the fifth time I stand on this shore,\n\n00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:22.924\nthe Cuban shore,\n\n00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.809\nlooking out at that distant horizon,\n\n00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:31.163\nbelieving, again,\n\n00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.388\nthat I'm going to make it all the way\n\n00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:38.463\nacross that vast,\ndangerous wilderness of an ocean.\n\n00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.229\nNot only have I tried four times,\n\n00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:44.940\nbut the greatest swimmers in the world\nhave been trying since 1950,\n\n00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:47.680\nand it's still never been done.\n\n00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:52.732\nThe team is proud of our four attempts.\n\n00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:55.818\nIt's an expedition of some 30 people.\n\n00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:59.796\nBonnie is my best friend and head handler,\n\n00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:03.082\nwho somehow summons will,\n\n00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:06.865\nthat last drop of will within me,\nwhen I think it's gone,\n\n00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:09.841\nafter many, many hours and days out there.\n\n00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:12.850\nThe shark experts\nare the best in the world --\n\n00:01:12.874 --> 00:01:15.292\nlarge predators below.\n\n00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:21.461\nThe box jellyfish, the deadliest venom\nin all of the ocean,\n\n00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:23.061\nis in these waters,\n\n00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:26.904\nand I have come close to dying from them\non a previous attempt.\n\n00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:30.490\nThe conditions themselves,\n\n00:01:30.514 --> 00:01:34.760\nbesides the sheer distance\nof over 100 miles in the open ocean --\n\n00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:39.820\nthe currents and whirling eddies\nand the Gulf Stream itself,\n\n00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:43.752\nthe most unpredictable\nof all of the planet Earth.\n\n00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:48.840\nAnd by the way -- it's amusing to me\n\n00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:54.423\nthat journalists and people,\nbefore these attempts, often ask me,\n\n00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.851\n\"Well, are you going to go with any boats\nor any people or anything?\"\n\n00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:59.338\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:01.498\nAnd I'm thinking, what are they imagining?\n\n00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:04.542\nThat I'll just sort of do\nsome celestial navigation --\n\n00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:05.673\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:05.697 --> 00:02:09.201\nAnd carry a bowie knife in my mouth,\n\n00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:12.764\nand I'll hunt fish and skin them\nalive and eat them,\n\n00:02:12.788 --> 00:02:17.535\nand maybe drag a desalinization plant\nbehind me for fresh water.\n\n00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:22.265\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:23.546\nYes, I have a team.\n\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.073\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:28.376\nAnd the team is expert,\n\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.548\nand the team is courageous,\n\n00:02:30.572 --> 00:02:34.734\nand brimming with innovation\nand scientific discovery,\n\n00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:38.845\nas is true of any major\nexpedition on the planet.\n\n00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.092\nAnd we've been on a journey.\n\n00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:45.137\nAnd the debate has raged, hasn't it,\n\n00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:46.517\nsince the Greeks,\n\n00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.658\nof isn't it what it's all about?\n\n00:02:49.404 --> 00:02:53.265\nIsn't life about the journey,\nnot really the destination?\n\n00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.088\nAnd here we've been on this journey,\n\n00:02:56.112 --> 00:02:58.360\nand the truth is, it's been thrilling.\n\n00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:00.131\nWe haven't reached that other shore,\n\n00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:03.883\nand still, our sense\nof pride and commitment,\n\n00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:06.046\nunwavering commitment.\n\n00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.055\nWhen I turned 60,\nthe dream was still alive\n\n00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:15.123\nfrom having tried this in my 20s --\ndreamed it and imagined it.\n\n00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:20.866\nThe most famous body of water\non the Earth today, I imagine,\n\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.304\nCuba to Florida.\n\n00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:26.239\nAnd it was deep. It was deep in my soul.\n\n00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.673\nWhen I turned 60,\n\n00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.998\nit wasn't so much\nabout the athletic accomplishment,\n\n00:03:32.022 --> 00:03:35.313\nit wasn't the ego\nof \"I want to be the first.\"\n\n00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:37.591\nThat's always there and it's undeniable.\n\n00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.832\nBut it was deeper.\n\n00:03:39.856 --> 00:03:41.889\nIt was \"how much life is there left?\"\n\n00:03:41.913 --> 00:03:44.724\nLet's face it -- we're all\non a one-way street, aren't we?\n\n00:03:45.177 --> 00:03:46.720\nAnd what are we going to do?\n\n00:03:46.744 --> 00:03:51.019\nWhat are we going to do as we go forward,\nto have no regrets looking back?\n\n00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:54.790\nAnd all this past year in training,\n\n00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:57.501\nI had that Teddy Roosevelt quote\n\n00:03:57.525 --> 00:03:59.778\nto paraphrase it,\nfloating around in my brain.\n\n00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:01.617\nIt says, \"You go ahead.\n\n00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:04.737\nYou go ahead and sit back\nin your comfortable chair\n\n00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.689\nand you be the critic,\nyou be the observer,\n\n00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:12.127\nwhile the brave one\ngets in the ring and engages\n\n00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:17.358\nand gets bloody and gets dirty and fails\nover and over and over again,\n\n00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:22.104\nbut yet isn't afraid and isn't timid\nand lives life in a bold way.\"\n\n00:04:22.902 --> 00:04:25.335\nAnd so of course I want to make it across.\n\n00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:30.202\nIt is the goal, and I should\nbe so shallow to say that this year,\n\n00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:34.132\nthe destination was even sweeter\nthan the journey.\n\n00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:36.059\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:39.491\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.892\nBut the journey itself\nwas worthwhile taking.\n\n00:04:42.797 --> 00:04:45.215\nAnd at this point, by this summer,\n\n00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:48.371\neverybody -- scientists,\nsports scientists,\n\n00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:52.028\nendurance experts, neurologists,\n\n00:04:53.277 --> 00:04:55.671\nmy own team, Bonnie --\n\n00:04:57.713 --> 00:04:58.965\nsaid it's impossible.\n\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.088\nIt just simply can't be done,\nand Bonnie said to me,\n\n00:05:02.112 --> 00:05:04.098\n\"But if you're going to take the journey,\n\n00:05:04.122 --> 00:05:06.313\nI'm going to see you\nthrough to the end of it,\n\n00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:07.500\nso I'll be there.\"\n\n00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:08.965\nAnd now we're there.\n\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.963\nAs we're looking out,\nkind of a surreal moment\n\n00:05:14.987 --> 00:05:16.291\nbefore the first stroke,\n\n00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.817\nstanding on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,\n\n00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:21.510\nthe Cuban flag is flying above,\n\n00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:25.784\nall my team is out in their boats,\nhands up in the air,\n\n00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:27.126\n\"We're here!\n\n00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:29.051\nWe're here for you!\"\n\n00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:33.064\nBonnie and I look at each other and say,\n\n00:05:33.088 --> 00:05:36.337\nthis year, the mantra is --\nand I've been using it in training --\n\n00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:38.330\nFind a way.\n\n00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:40.296\nYou have a dream\n\n00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:44.820\nand you have obstacles\nin front of you, as we all do.\n\n00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.258\nNone of us ever get through this life\n\n00:05:48.496 --> 00:05:49.818\nwithout heartache,\n\n00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:53.281\nwithout turmoil,\n\n00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:57.131\nand if you believe and you have faith\n\n00:05:57.155 --> 00:05:59.527\nand you can get knocked down\nand get back up again\n\n00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:02.452\nand you believe in perseverance\n\n00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:06.094\nas a

find\nour way to Florida.\"\n\n00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:15.881\nAnd we started, and for the next 53 hours,\n\n00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:20.331\nit was an intense,\nunforgettable life experience.\n\n00:06:21.605 --> 00:06:23.822\nThe highs were high, the awe --\n\n00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:26.171\nI'm not a religious person,\nbut I'll tell you,\n\n00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:29.620\nto be

jellyfish,\n\n00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:53.988\nlights attract sharks,\n\n00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:56.373\nlights attract baitfish\nthat attract sharks,\n\n00:06:56.397 --> 00:06:58.874\nso we go in the

mouth,\n\n00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:33.839\nbut the tentacles can't get you.\n\n00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:37.226\nAnd the hypothermia sets in.\n\n00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.635\nThe water's 85 degrees,\nand yet you're losing weight\n\n00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:41.978\nand using calories.\n\n00:08:42.002 --> 00:08:44.440\nAnd as you come over\ntoward the side of the boat --\n\n00:08:44.464 -->

am I all right.\n\n00:08:52.335 --> 00:08:55.194\nI am seeing the Taj Mahal --\n\n00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:56.439\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:56.463 --> 00:08:57.746\nOver here.\n\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.533\nI'm in a very different state --\n\n00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:02.929\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:02.953 --> 00:09:05.715\nAnd I'm thinking, \"Wow!\n\n00:09:05.739 --> 00:09:09.328\nI never thought I'd be running\ninto the Taj Mahal out here.\n\n00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:11.382\nIt's gorgeous!\n\n00:09:11.406 --> 00:09:13.995\nI mean, how long\ndid it take them to build that?\n\n00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:15.706\nIt's just ...\n\n00:09:16.273 --> 00:09:18.373\nSo, uh -- wooo -- you know?\n\n00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:21.576\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:24.452\nWe kind of have a cardinal rule\n\n00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:27.945\nthat I'm never told how far it is,\nbecause we don't know how far it is.\n\n00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:31.146\nWhat's going to happen to you\nbetween this point and that point?\n\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.774\nWhat's going to happen\nto the weather and the currents\n\n00:09:33.798 --> 00:09:35.758\nand, God forbid, you're stung,\n\n00:09:35.782 --> 00:09:39.676\nwhen you don't think you could\nbe stung in all this armor.\n\n00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.581\nBonnie made a decision\ncoming into that third morning\n\n00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.501\nthat I was suffering,\n\n00:09:46.525 --> 00:09:49.838\nand I was hanging on by a thread.\n\n00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:51.662\nAnd she said, \"Come here,\"\n\n00:09:51.686 --> 00:09:53.773\nand I came close\nto the boat, and she said,\n\n00:09:53.797 --> 00:09:54.995\n\"Look, look out there.\"\n\n00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:56.172\nAnd I saw light,\n\n00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:58.198\nbecause the day is easier than the night,\n\n00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:00.052\nand I thought we were coming into day.\n\n00:10:00.076 --> 00:10:03.734\nI saw a stream of white light\nalong the horizon,\n\n00:10:03.758 --> 00:10:06.036\nand I said, \"It's going\nto be morning soon.\"\n\n00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.324\nAnd she said, \"No, those\nare the lights of Key West.\"\n\n00:10:11.608 --> 00:10:13.450\nIt was 15 more hours,\n\n00:10:13.474 --> 00:10:15.683\nwhich for most swimmers\nwould be a long time.\n\n00:10:15.707 --> 00:10:18.833\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:18.857 --> 00:10:22.174\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:22.198 --> 00:10:26.202\nYou have no idea how many\n15-hour training swims I had done.\n\n00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:30.560\nSo here we go, and I somehow,\nwithout a decision,\n\n00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:32.902\nwent into no counting of strokes\n\n00:10:32.926 --> 00:10:34.235\nand no singing\n\n00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:39.450\nand no quoting Stephen Hawking\non the parameters of the universe.\n\n00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:45.701\nI just went into thinking\nabout this dream, and why and how.\n\n00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.288\nAs I said, when I turned 60,\n\n00:10:48.312 --> 00:10:52.316\nit wasn't about that concrete\n\"Can you do it?\"\n\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.276\nThat's the everyday machinations.\n\n00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.047\nThat's the discipline,\nand it's the preparation,\n\n00:10:58.071 --> 00:10:59.776\nand there's a pride in that.\n\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.690\nBut I decided to think, as I went along,\n\n00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:08.214\nabout -- you know, the phrase usually is,\n\"reaching for the stars.\"\n\n00:11:08.238 --> 00:11:10.801\nAnd in my case,\nit's reaching for the horizon.\n\n00:11:11.396 --> 00:11:13.267\nAnd when you reach for the horizon,\n\n00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:15.409\nas I've proven, you may not get there.\n\n00:11:15.994 --> 00:11:21.421\nBut what a tremendous build\nof character and spirit\n\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.343\nthat you lay down;\n\n00:11:24.367 --> 00:11:28.257\nwhat a foundation you lay down\nin reaching for those horizons.\n\n00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:31.700\nAnd now, the shore is coming.\n\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.934\nAnd there's just a little part\nof me that's sad.\n\n00:11:35.537 --> 00:11:37.754\nThe epic journey is going to be over.\n\n00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:39.844\nSo many people come up to me now and say,\n\n00:11:39.868 --> 00:11:41.061\n\"What's next?\"\n\n00:11:41.085 --> 00:11:42.507\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:43.836\n\"We love that!\"\n\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.947\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.851\n\"That little tracker on the computer?\n\n00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:48.716\nWhen are you going to do the next one?\n\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.572\nWe can't wait to follow the next one.\"\n\n00:11:50.596 --> 00:11:52.776\nWell, they were just there for 53 hours,\n\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.745\nand I was there for years.\n\n00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:58.592\nAnd so there won't be another\nepic journey in the ocean.\n\n00:11:58.616 --> 00:12:02.167\nBut the point is, and the point was,\n\n00:12:02.191 --> 00:12:06.444\nthat every day of our lives is epic.\n\n00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:09.847\nAnd I'll tell you,\nwhen I walked up onto that beach,\n\n00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:11.709\nstaggered up onto that beach ...\n\n00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:18.293\nI had so many times,\nin a very puffed-up ego way,\n\n00:12:18.317 --> 00:12:20.352\nrehearsed what I would say ...\n\n00:12:20.376 --> 00:12:22.023\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:22.047 --> 00:12:23.297\non the beach.\n\n00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.261\nWhen Bonnie thought the back\nof my throat was swelling up,\n\n00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:28.454\nshe brought the medical team\nover to our boat\n\n00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:32.686\nto say, \"She's really beginning\nto have trouble breathing;\n\n00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.765\nanother 12, 24 hours\nin the saltwater ...\" --\n\n00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:39.534\nthe whole thing -- I just thought,\nin my hallucinatory moment,\n\n00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.944\nthat I heard the word \"tracheotomy.\"\n\n00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:44.298\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:48.099\nBonnie said to the doctor,\n\"I'm not worried about her not breathing.\n\n00:12:48.123 --> 00:12:50.264\nIf she can't talk\nwhen she gets to the shore,\n\n00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:51.815\nshe's going to be pissed off.\"\n\n00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:57.046\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.975\nBut the truth is, all those orations\nthat I had practiced,\n\n00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:04.875\njust to get myself through some\ntraining swims as motivation --\n\n00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:06.367\nit wasn't like that.\n\n00:13:06.391 --> 00:13:08.839\nIt was a very real moment,\n\n00:13:08.863 --> 00:13:10.887\nwith that crowd, with my team.\n\n00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:13.811\nWe did it. I didn't do it. We did it.\n\n00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.612\nAnd we'll never forget it.\nIt'll always be part of us.\n\n00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:21.157\nThe three things I did sort of blurt out\nwhen we got there, was first:\n\n00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:23.344\nNever, ever give up.\n\n00:13:24.508 --> 00:13:25.910\nI live it.\n\n00:13:25.934 --> 00:13:28.233\nWhat's the phrase\nfrom today from Socrates?\n\n00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:30.021\nAudience: To be is to do.\n\n00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:31.353\nDiana Nyad: To be is to do.\n\n00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:34.366\nSo I don't stand up and say,\n\"Don't ever give up.\"\n\n00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.742\nI didn't give up.\n\n00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:38.226\nThere was action behind these words.\n\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.944\nThe second is:\n\n00:13:39.968 --> 00:13:43.244\nYou can chase your dreams\nat any age; you're never too old.\n\n00:13:43.268 --> 00:13:48.347\nSixty-four; a thing no one,\nat any age, any gender, could ever do\n\n00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:49.527\nhas done it.\n\n00:13:49.551 --> 00:13:51.090\nAnd there's no doubt in my mind\n\n00:13:51.114 --> 00:13:53.782\nthat I am at the prime of my life today.\n\n00:13:53.806 --> 00:13:56.610\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:56.634 --> 00:13:57.882\nYeah.\n\n00:13:57.906 --> 00:14:02.192\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.392\nThank you.\n\n00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:06.182\nAnd the third thing\nI said on that beach was,\n\n00:14:06.206 --> 00:14:08.858\nit looks like the most solitary\nendeavor in the world,\n\n00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:10.985\nand in many ways, of course, it is.\n\n00:14:11.009 --> 00:14:14.658\nAnd in other ways,\nand the most important ways,\n\n00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:15.870\nit's a team.\n\n00:14:15.894 --> 00:14:18.603\nAnd if you think I'm a badass,\nyou want to meet Bonnie.\n\n00:14:18.627 --> 00:14:20.079\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:20.103 --> 00:14:21.361\nBonnie, where are you?\n\n00:14:22.699 --> 00:14:23.972\nWhere are you?\n\n00:14:25.194 --> 00:14:26.573\nThere's Bonnie Stoll.\n\n00:14:26.597 --> 00:14:28.984\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:29.008 --> 00:14:30.302\nMy buddy.\n\n00:14:30.326 --> 00:14:33.331\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:35.675\nThe Henry David Thoreau quote goes,\n\n00:14:35.699 --> 00:14:38.969\n\"When you achieve your dreams,\nit's not so much what you get\n\n00:14:38.993 --> 00:14:41.291\nas who you have become in achieving them.\"\n\n00:14:41.862 --> 00:14:43.773\nAnd yeah, I stand before you now.\n\n00:14:43.797 --> 00:14:45.797\nIn the three months since that swim ended,\n\n00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:47.625\nI've sat down with Oprah,\n\n00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:51.407\nand I've been in\nPresident Obama's Oval Office;\n\n00:14:51.431 --> 00:14:53.982\nI've been invited to speak\nin front of esteemed groups\n\n00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:55.157\nsuch as yourselves;\n\n00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:57.432\nI've signed a wonderful\nmajor book contract.\n\n00:14:57.456 --> 00:15:00.167\nAll of that's great,\nand I don't denigrate it.\n\n00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.082\nI'm proud of it all, but the truth is,\n\n00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:03.399\nI'm walking around tall\n\n00:15:03.423 --> 00:15:09.366\nbecause I am that bold, fearless person,\nand I will be, every day,\n\n00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.539\nuntil it's time for these days to be done.\n\n00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:15.721\nThank you very much\nand enjoy the conference.\n\n00:15:15.745 --> 00:15:17.852\nThank you.

Yeah?How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City and have no idea who I am? (Laughter)Most of you. Let me give you a little bit of background.Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable. Back on a spring day in 1889, the federal government held what they called a land run. They literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line, and they fired off a gun, and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake, and wherever they put down that stake, that was their new home. And at the end of the very first day, the population of Oklahoma City had gone from zero to 10,000, and our planning department is still paying for that. The citizens got together on that first day and elected a mayor. And then they shot him. (Laughter) That's not really all that funny \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 but it allows me to see what type of audience I'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback.The 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City. Our economy was based on commodities, so the price of cotton or the price of wheat, and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas. And along the way, we became a city of innovation. The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City. (Applause) The parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City. You're welcome.Having an economy, though, that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs, and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history. In the 1970s, when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat, our economy was soaring, and then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly. The price of energy dropped. Our banks began to fail. Before the end of the decade, 100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma. There was no bailout on the horizon. Our banking industry, our oil and gas industry, our commercial real estate industry, were all at the bottom of the economic scale. Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo, anywhere where they could  find a job that measured up to their educational attainment, because in Oklahoma City, the good jobs just weren't there.But along at the end of the '80s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named Ron Norick. Ron Norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn't incentivizing companies up front, it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate, and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff. It built a new sports arena, a new canal downtown, it fixed up our performing arts center, a new baseball stadium downtown, a lot of things to improve the quality of life. And the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life.The next mayor came along. He started MAPS for Kids, rebuilt the entire inner city school system, all 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished.And then, in 2004, in this rare collective lack of judgment bordering on civil disobedience, the citizens elected me mayor.Now the city I inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy, and for the very first time, we started showing up on the lists. Now you know the lists I'm talking about. The media and the Internet love to rank cities. And in Oklahoma City, we'd never really been on lists before. So I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there. We weren't anywhere close to the top, but we were on the list, we were somebody. Best city to get a job, best city to start a business, best downtown \u2014 Oklahoma City.And then came the list of the most obese cities in the country. And there we were.Now I like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places. (Laughter) Dallas and Houston and New Orleans and Atlanta and Miami. You know, these are cities that, typically, you're not embarrassed to be associated with. But nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list.And about that time, I got on the scales. And I weighed 220 pounds. And then I went to this website sponsored by the federal government, and I typed in my height, I typed in my weight, and I pushed Enter, and it came back and said \"obese.\"I thought, \"What a stupid website.\" (Laughter) \"I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese.\"And then I started getting honest with myself about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity, and I noticed this pattern, that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year, and then about every 10 years, I'd drop 20 or 30 pounds. And then I'd do it again. And I had this huge closet full of clothes, and I could only wear a third of it at any one time, and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear. But it all seemed fairly normal, going through it.Well, I finally decided I needed to lose weight, and I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before, so I simply stopped eating as much. I had always exercised. That really wasn't the part of the equation that I needed to work on. But I had been eating 3,000 calories a day, and I cut it to 2,000 calories a day, and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week for about 40 weeks.Along the way, though, I started examining my city, its culture, its infrastructure, trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity. And I came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car. (Laughter) But if you happen to be a person, you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn. Our city is very spread out. We have a great intersection of highways, I mean, literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of. And so people live far, far away. Our city limits are enormous, 620 square miles, but 15 miles is less than 15 minutes. You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. And as a result, people tend to spread out. Land's cheap. We had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments  for a long, long time. We had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently, and there were literally 100,000 or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had  virtually no level of walkability.And as I tried to examine how we might deal with obesity, and was taking all of these elements into my mind, I decided that the first thing we need to do was have a conversation. You see, in Oklahoma City, we weren't talking about obesity. And so, on New Year's Eve of 2007, I went to the zoo, and I stood in front of the elephants, and I said, \"This city is going on a diet, and we're going to lose a million pounds.\"Well, that's when all hell broke loose.(Laughter)The national media gravitated toward this story immediately, and they really could have  gone with it one of two ways. They could have said, \"This city is so fat that the mayor had to put them on a diet.\" But fortunately, the consensus was, \"Look, this is a problem in a lot of places. This is a city that's wanting to do something about it.\" And so they started helping us drive traffic to the website. Now, the web address was thiscityisgoingonadiet.com. And I appeared on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" one weekday morning to talk about the initiative, and on that day, 150,000 visits were placed to our website. People were signing up, and so the pounds started to add up, and the conversation that I thought was so important to have was starting to take place. It was taking place inside the homes, mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids. It was taking place in churches. Churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity. Suddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace. And the large companies, they typically have wonderful wellness programs, but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this, they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others.And then came the next stage of the equation. It was time to push what I called MAPS 3. Now MAPS 3, like the other two programs, had had an economic development motive behind it, but along with the traditional economic development tasks like building a new convention center, we added some health-related infrastructure to the process. We added a new central park, 70 acres in size, to be right downtown in Oklahoma City. We're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there. We're building senior health and wellness centers throughout the community. We put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original MAPS, and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing. We hosted the Olympic trials last spring. We have Olympic-caliber events coming to Oklahoma City, and athletes from all over the world moving in, along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional. We also, with another initiative that was passed, are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area. We're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two. We had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods, but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability. Through yet another funding source, we're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian-friendly. Our streets were really wide, and you'd push the button to allow you to walk across, and you had to run in order to get there in time. But now we've narrowed the streets, highly landscaped them, making them more pedestrian-friendly, really a redesign, rethinking the way we build our infrastructure, designing a city around people and not cars. We're completing our bicycle trail master plan. We'll have over 100 miles when we're through building it out.And so you see this culture starting to shift in Oklahoma City. And lo and behold, the demographic changes that are coming with it are very inspiring. Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and, indeed, even from further away, in California.When we reached a million pounds, in January of 2012, I flew to New York with some our participants who had lost over 100 pounds, whose lives had been changed, and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show, and then that afternoon, I did a round of media in New York pushing the same messages that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it. And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine, the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before. And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter, I notice there's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table, and I pick it up, and I look at the headline across the top, and it says, \"America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?\" Well, I knew I did, so I picked up the magazine and I began to look, and we weren't on it.(Applause)Then I looked on the list of fittest cities, and we were on that list. We were on the list as the 22nd fittest city in the United States. Our state health statistics are doing better. Granted, we have a long way to go. Health is still not something that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City, but we seem to have turned the cultural shift of making health a greater priority. And we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings, people with choices, choosing Oklahoma City in large numbers. We have the lowest unemployment in the United States, probably the strongest economy in the United States. And if you're like me, at some point in your educational career, you were asked to read a book called \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" Oklahomans leaving for California in large numbers for a better future. When we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west, it appears that what we're seeing now is the wrath of grapes. (Laughter) (Applause) The grandchildren are coming home.You've been a great audience and very attentive. Thank you very much for having me here.(Applause)", "id": 1865, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.443\nHow many of you have been to Oklahoma City?\n\n00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:15.733\nRaise your hand. Yeah?\n\n00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.882\nHow many of you have not been to Oklahoma City\n\n00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.891\nand have no idea who I am? (Laughter)\n\n00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:24.689\nMost of you. Let me give you\na little bit of background.\n\n00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.131\nOklahoma City started in the most\n\n00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.899\nunique way imaginable.\n\n00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.721\nBack on a spring day in 1889,\n\n00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.308\nthe federal government held what they called\n\n00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:35.067\na land run.\n\n00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.761\nThey literally lined up the settlers\n\n00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:38.384\nalong an imaginary line,\n\n00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:39.809\nand they fired off a gun,\n\n00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.594\nand the settlers roared across the countryside\n\n00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.710\nand put down a stake,\n\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.246\nand wherever they put down that stake,\n\n00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:46.954\nthat was their new home.\n\n00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:49.324\nAnd at the end of the very first day,\n\n00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:51.074\nthe population of Oklahoma City\n\n00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:54.980\nhad gone from zero to 10,000,\n\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.321\nand our planning department\n\n00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:00.241\nis still paying for that.\n\n00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:02.738\nThe citizens got together on that first day\n\n00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:04.990\nand elected a mayor.\n\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.797\nAnd then they shot him.\n\n00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:11.446\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.388\nThat's not really all that funny\n\n00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:15.892\n-- (Laughter) --\n\n00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:17.812\nbut it allows me to see what type of audience\n\n00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:22.174\nI'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback.\n\n00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:24.951\nThe 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City.\n\n00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.412\nOur economy was based on commodities,\n\n00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:30.211\nso the price of cotton or the price of wheat,\n\n00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:33.524\nand ultimately the price of oil and natural gas.\n\n00:01:33.524 --> 00:01:35.636\nAnd along the way, we became a city\n\n00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.682\nof innovation.\n\n00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:41.555\nThe shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City.\n\n00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:46.695\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:51.995\nThe parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.\n\n00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:55.741\nYou're welcome.\n\n00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.437\nHaving an economy, though,\n\n00:01:57.437 --> 00:02:00.584\nthat relates to commodities\ncan give you some ups and some downs,\n\n00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:03.181\nand that was certainly the case\nin Oklahoma City's history.\n\n00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.538\nIn the 1970s, when it appeared\n\n00:02:05.538 --> 00:02:07.361\nthat the price of energy would never retreat,\n\n00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.095\nour economy was soaring,\n\n00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.677\nand then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.\n\n00:02:12.677 --> 00:02:15.148\nThe price of energy dropped.\n\n00:02:15.148 --> 00:02:16.900\nOur banks began to fail.\n\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.458\nBefore the end of the decade,\n\n00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:22.345\n100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma.\n\n00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:24.896\nThere was no bailout on the horizon.\n\n00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:27.201\nOur banking industry, our oil and gas industry,\n\n00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:29.237\nour commercial real estate industry,\n\n00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:32.440\nwere all at the bottom of the economic scale.\n\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.085\nYoung people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves\n\n00:02:35.085 --> 00:02:38.000\nfor Washington and Dallas and Houston\nand New York and Tokyo,\n\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.107\nanywhere where they could \nfind a job that measured up\n\n00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:41.778\nto their educational attainment,\n\n00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:45.009\nbecause in Oklahoma City,\nthe good jobs just weren't there.\n\n00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.725\nBut along at the end of the '80s\n\n00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:49.553\ncame an enterprising businessman\n\n00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:51.562\nwho became mayor named Ron Norick.\n\n00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.309\nRon Norick eventually figured out\n\n00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.246\nthat the secret to economic development\n\n00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:57.407\nwasn't incentivizing companies up front,\n\n00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:00.461\nit was about creating a place\nwhere businesses wanted to locate,\n\n00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.473\nand so he pushed an initiative called MAPS\n\n00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:05.878\nthat basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax\n\n00:03:05.878 --> 00:03:08.190\nto build a bunch of stuff.\n\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.165\nIt built a new sports arena,\n\n00:03:10.165 --> 00:03:12.344\na new canal downtown,\n\n00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:14.705\nit fixed up our performing arts center,\n\n00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:17.372\na new baseball stadium downtown,\n\n00:03:17.372 --> 00:03:19.216\na lot of things to improve the quality of life.\n\n00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:21.629\nAnd the economy indeed seemed to start\n\n00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.661\nshowing some signs of life.\n\n00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.019\nThe next mayor came along.\n\n00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.796\nHe started MAPS for Kids,\n\n00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:30.523\nrebuilt the entire inner city school system,\n\n00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:35.277\nall 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished.\n\n00:03:35.277 --> 00:03:38.498\nAnd then, in 2004,\n\n00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:43.202\nin this rare collective lack of judgment\n\n00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:45.830\nbordering on civil disobedience,\n\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.798\nthe citizens elected me mayor.\n\n00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:52.002\nNow the city I inherited\n\n00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:53.846\nwas just on the verge\n\n00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:57.247\nof coming out of its slumbering economy,\n\n00:03:57.247 --> 00:03:58.938\nand for the very first time,\n\n00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:02.077\nwe started showing up on the lists.\n\n00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:04.094\nNow you know the lists I'm talking about.\n\n00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:05.877\nThe media and the Internet\n\n00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:08.423\nlove to rank cities.\n\n00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:10.498\nAnd in Oklahoma City,\n\n00:04:10.498 --> 00:04:13.179\nwe'd never really been on lists before.\n\n00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:14.885\nSo I thought it was kind of cool\n\n00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.581\nwhen they came out with these\npositive lists and we were on there.\n\n00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:19.279\nWe weren't anywhere close to the top,\n\n00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.776\nbut we were on the list, we were somebody.\n\n00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:24.606\nBest city to get a job,\n\n00:04:24.606 --> 00:04:26.621\nbest city to start a business,\n\n00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.414\nbest downtown --\n\n00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:30.888\nOklahoma City.\n\n00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:34.193\nAnd then came the list\n\n00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:39.739\nof the most obese cities in the country.\n\n00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:42.842\nAnd there we were.\n\n00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:44.986\nNow I like to point out that we were on that list\n\n00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:47.484\nwith a lot of really cool places.\n\n00:04:47.484 --> 00:04:48.707\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:48.707 --> 00:04:51.963\nDallas and Houston and New Orleans\n\n00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:53.673\nand Atlanta and Miami.\n\n00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:55.170\nYou know, these are cities that, typically,\n\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.818\nyou're not embarrassed to be associated with.\n\n00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:02.086\nBut nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list.\n\n00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:06.431\nAnd about that time, I got on the scales.\n\n00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.557\nAnd I weighed 220 pounds.\n\n00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:10.060\nAnd then I went to this website\n\n00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.910\nsponsored by the federal government,\n\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.583\nand I typed in my height, I typed in my weight,\n\n00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:16.912\nand I pushed Enter,\n\n00:05:16.912 --> 00:05:20.962\nand it came back and said \"obese.\"\n\n00:05:20.962 --> 00:05:23.215\nI thought, \"What a stupid website.\"\n\n00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:26.090\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.335\n\"I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese.\"\n\n00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:34.826\nAnd then I started getting honest with myself\n\n00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:39.752\nabout what had become\nmy lifelong struggle with obesity,\n\n00:05:39.752 --> 00:05:41.632\nand I noticed this pattern,\n\n00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:44.323\nthat I was gaining about two or three pounds a year,\n\n00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:47.629\nand then about every 10 years,\nI'd drop 20 or 30 pounds.\n\n00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:49.191\nAnd then I'd do it again.\n\n00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:51.524\nAnd I had this huge closet full of clothes,\n\n00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:54.891\nand I could only wear a third of it at any one time,\n\n00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:59.003\nand only I knew which part of the closet I could wear.\n\n00:05:59.003 --> 00:06:04.553\nBut it all seemed fairly normal, going through it.\n\n00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:07.635\nWell, I finally decided I needed to lose weight,\n\n00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.052\nand I knew I could because\nI'd done it so many times before,\n\n00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:12.290\nso I simply stopped eating as much.\n\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.545\nI had always exercised.\n\n00:06:13.545 --> 00:06:15.420\nThat really wasn't the part of the equation\n\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.333\nthat I needed to work on.\n\n00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:20.162\nBut I had been eating 3,000 calories a day,\n\n00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:22.444\nand I cut it to 2,000 calories a day,\n\n00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:25.335\nand the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week\n\n00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:29.241\nfor about 40 weeks.\n\n00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.786\nAlong the way, though,\n\n00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:34.806\nI started examining my city,\n\n00:06:34.806 --> 00:06:38.302\nits culture, its infrastructure,\n\n00:06:38.302 --> 00:06:41.194\ntrying to figure out why our specific city\n\n00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:45.593\nseemed to have a problem with obesity.\n\n00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:47.769\nAnd I came to the conclusion\n\n00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:51.627\nthat we had built an incredible quality of life\n\n00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:55.047\nif you happen to be a car.\n\n00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:58.282\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:58.282 --> 00:07:01.822\nBut if you happen to be a person,\n\n00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:06.391\nyou are combatting the car seemingly at every turn.\n\n00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:08.664\nOur city is very spread out.\n\n00:07:08.664 --> 00:07:12.219\nWe have a great intersection of highways,\n\n00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:15.833\nI mean, literally no traffic congestion\nin Oklahoma City to speak of.\n\n00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:18.044\nAnd so people live far, far away.\n\n00:07:18.044 --> 00:07:21.629\nOur city limits are enormous, 620 square miles,\n\n00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:25.174\nbut 15 miles is less than 15 minutes.\n\n00:07:25.174 --> 00:07:27.109\nYou literally can get a speeding ticket\n\n00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:30.706\nduring rush hour in Oklahoma City.\n\n00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:33.203\nAnd as a result, people tend to spread out.\n\n00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:36.896\nLand's cheap.\n\n00:07:36.896 --> 00:07:39.462\nWe had also not required developers\n\n00:07:39.462 --> 00:07:41.957\nto build sidewalks on new developments \nfor a long, long time.\n\n00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:44.370\nWe had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently,\n\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.764\nand there were literally 100,000\n\n00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:49.440\nor more homes into our inventory\n\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.518\nin neighborhoods that had \nvirtually no level of walkability.\n\n00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:00.076\nAnd as I tried to examine\n\n00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:02.049\nhow we might deal with obesity,\n\n00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:03.933\nand was taking all of these elements into my mind,\n\n00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:07.347\nI decided that the first thing we need to do\n\n00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:09.467\nwas have a conversation.\n\n00:08:09.467 --> 00:08:11.426\nYou see, in Oklahoma City,\n\n00:08:11.426 --> 00:08:14.207\nwe weren't talking about obesity.\n\n00:08:14.207 --> 00:08:19.218\nAnd so, on New Year's Eve of 2007,\n\n00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:21.257\nI went to the zoo,\n\n00:08:21.257 --> 00:08:23.678\nand I stood in front of the elephants,\n\n00:08:23.678 --> 00:08:27.541\nand I said, \"This city is going on a diet,\n\n00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:31.160\nand we're going to lose a million pounds.\"\n\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.933\nWell, that's when all hell broke loose.\n\n00:08:32.933 --> 00:08:35.711\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:37.594\nThe national media\n\n00:08:37.594 --> 00:08:42.111\ngravitated toward this story immediately,\n\n00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:44.970\nand they really could have \ngone with it one of two ways.\n\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.501\nThey could have said,\n\n00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:48.643\n\"This city is so fat\n\n00:08:48.643 --> 00:08:51.959\nthat the mayor had to put them on a diet.\"\n\n00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:54.462\nBut fortunately, the consensus was,\n\n00:08:54.462 --> 00:08:56.809\n\"Look, this is a problem in a lot of places.\n\n00:08:56.809 --> 00:09:00.668\nThis is a city that's wanting\nto do something about it.\"\n\n00:09:00.668 --> 00:09:02.638\nAnd so they started helping us\n\n00:09:02.638 --> 00:09:04.788\ndrive traffic to the website.\n\n00:09:04.788 --> 00:09:06.306\nNow, the web address was\n\n00:09:06.306 --> 00:09:11.287\nthiscityisgoingonadiet.com.\n\n00:09:11.287 --> 00:09:14.706\nAnd I appeared on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\"\n\n00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:18.126\none weekday morning to talk about the initiative,\n\n00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:21.646\nand on that day, 150,000 visits\n\n00:09:21.646 --> 00:09:23.466\nwere placed to our website.\n\n00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:25.040\nPeople were signing up,\n\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.886\nand so the pounds started to add up,\n\n00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:29.493\nand the conversation that I thought\n\n00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:33.257\nwas so important to have was starting to take place.\n\n00:09:33.257 --> 00:09:35.806\nIt was taking place inside the homes,\n\n00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:38.383\nmothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.\n\n00:09:38.383 --> 00:09:41.044\nIt was taking place in churches.\n\n00:09:41.044 --> 00:09:43.040\nChurches were starting their own running groups\n\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.328\nand their own support groups\n\n00:09:44.328 --> 00:09:47.060\nfor people who were dealing with obesity.\n\n00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.472\nSuddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools\n\n00:09:50.472 --> 00:09:52.104\nand in the workplace.\n\n00:09:52.104 --> 00:09:54.265\nAnd the large companies, they typically have\n\n00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:55.861\nwonderful wellness programs,\n\n00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.184\nbut the medium-sized companies\n\n00:09:57.184 --> 00:10:00.269\nthat typically fall between the cracks\non issues like this,\n\n00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:02.970\nthey started to get engaged and used our program\n\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.826\nas a model for their own employees\n\n00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.772\nto try and have contests to see\n\n00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:10.587\nwho might be able to deal with their obesity situation\n\n00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:15.554\nin a way that could be proactively\nbeneficial to others.\n\n00:10:15.554 --> 00:10:20.175\nAnd then came the next stage of the equation.\n\n00:10:20.175 --> 00:10:24.187\nIt was time to push what I called MAPS 3.\n\n00:10:24.187 --> 00:10:26.387\nNow MAPS 3, like the other two programs,\n\n00:10:26.387 --> 00:10:29.051\nhad had an economic development motive behind it,\n\n00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:31.871\nbut along with the traditional\neconomic development tasks\n\n00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:33.633\nlike building a new convention center,\n\n00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.397\nwe added some health-related infrastructure\n\n00:10:36.397 --> 00:10:38.289\nto the process.\n\n00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:41.034\nWe added a new central park, 70 acres in size,\n\n00:10:41.034 --> 00:10:43.424\nto be right downtown in Oklahoma City.\n\n00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:45.203\nWe're building a downtown streetcar\n\n00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:47.451\nto try and help the walkability formula\n\n00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:49.503\nfor people who choose to live in the inner city\n\n00:10:49.503 --> 00:10:52.880\nand help us create the density there.\n\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.235\nWe're building senior health and wellness centers\n\n00:10:56.235 --> 00:10:57.933\nthroughout the community.\n\n00:10:57.933 --> 00:10:59.621\nWe put some investments on the river\n\n00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.157\nthat had originally been invested upon\n\n00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:03.837\nin the original MAPS,\n\n00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:05.781\nand now we are currently in the final stages\n\n00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:08.432\nof developing the finest venue in the world\n\n00:11:08.432 --> 00:11:11.248\nfor the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing.\n\n00:11:11.248 --> 00:11:13.140\nWe hosted the Olympic trials last spring.\n\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.544\nWe have Olympic-caliber events\ncoming to Oklahoma City,\n\n00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:18.100\nand athletes from all over the world moving in,\n\n00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.702\nalong with inner city programs\n\n00:11:19.702 --> 00:11:23.652\nto get kids more engaged in these\ntypes of recreational activities\n\n00:11:23.652 --> 00:11:26.452\nthat are a little bit nontraditional.\n\n00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:30.178\nWe also, with another initiative that was passed,\n\n00:11:30.178 --> 00:11:34.021\nare building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks\n\n00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:36.420\nthroughout the metro area.\n\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.265\nWe're even going back into some\n\n00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:39.760\ninner city situations\n\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.474\nwhere we had built neighborhoods\n\n00:11:41.474 --> 00:11:43.155\nand we had built schools\n\n00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:45.081\nbut we had not connected the two.\n\n00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:47.799\nWe had built libraries and\nwe had built neighborhoods,\n\n00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.404\nbut we had never really connected the two\n\n00:11:49.404 --> 00:11:51.828\nwith any sort of walkability.\n\n00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:53.927\nThrough yet another funding source,\n\n00:11:53.927 --> 00:11:57.262\nwe're redesigning all of our inner city streets\n\n00:11:57.262 --> 00:11:58.772\nto be more pedestrian-friendly.\n\n00:11:58.772 --> 00:12:00.649\nOur streets were really wide,\n\n00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:03.076\nand you'd push the button\nto allow you to walk across,\n\n00:12:03.076 --> 00:12:06.624\nand you had to run in order to get there in time.\n\n00:12:06.624 --> 00:12:08.532\nBut now we've narrowed the streets,\n\n00:12:08.532 --> 00:12:11.440\nhighly landscaped them, making them\nmore pedestrian-friendly,\n\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.907\nreally a redesign, rethinking the way\n\n00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:15.455\nwe build our infrastructure,\n\n00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:20.702\ndesigning a city around people and not cars.\n\n00:12:20.702 --> 00:12:22.823\nWe're completing our bicycle trail master plan.\n\n00:12:22.823 --> 00:12:24.641\nWe'll have over 100 miles\n\n00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:27.433\nwhen we're through building it out.\n\n00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:30.694\nAnd so you see this culture starting to shift\n\n00:12:30.694 --> 00:12:32.198\nin Oklahoma City.\n\n00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:34.875\nAnd lo and behold, the demographic changes\n\n00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:37.855\nthat are coming with it are very inspiring.\n\n00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:39.438\nHighly educated twentysomethings\n\n00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:41.498\nare moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region\n\n00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:45.598\nand, indeed, even from further away, in California.\n\n00:12:48.673 --> 00:12:51.009\nWhen we reached a million pounds,\n\n00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:53.310\nin January of 2012,\n\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.753\nI flew to New York with some our participants\n\n00:12:55.753 --> 00:12:57.283\nwho had lost over 100 pounds,\n\n00:12:57.283 --> 00:12:59.568\nwhose lives had been changed,\n\n00:12:59.568 --> 00:13:01.739\nand we appeared on the Rachael Ray show,\n\n00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:05.146\nand then that afternoon,\nI did a round of media in New York\n\n00:13:05.146 --> 00:13:07.587\npushing the same messages\n\n00:13:07.587 --> 00:13:11.683\nthat you're accustomed to hearing\nabout obesity and the dangers of it.\n\n00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:16.664\nAnd I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine,\n\n00:13:16.664 --> 00:13:21.040\nthe same magazine that had put us on that list\n\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.403\nfive years before.\n\n00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.350\nAnd as I'm sitting in the lobby\nwaiting to talk to the reporter,\n\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.744\nI notice there's a magazine copy\n\n00:13:28.744 --> 00:13:31.363\nof the current issue right there on the table,\n\n00:13:31.363 --> 00:13:33.019\nand I pick it up, and I look at the headline\n\n00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:34.784\nacross the top, and it says,\n\n00:13:34.784 --> 00:13:39.465\n\"America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?\"\n\n00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:41.610\nWell, I knew I did,\n\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.762\nso I picked up the magazine\n\n00:13:43.762 --> 00:13:46.773\nand I began to look,\n\n00:13:46.773 --> 00:13:49.519\nand we weren't on it.\n\n00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:53.937\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:55.942 --> 00:13:58.867\nThen I looked on the list of fittest cities,\n\n00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:01.030\nand we were on that list.\n\n00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.408\nWe were on the list as the 22nd\nfittest city in the United States.\n\n00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:07.595\nOur state health statistics are doing better.\n\n00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:09.707\nGranted, we have a long way to go.\n\n00:14:09.707 --> 00:14:10.846\nHealth is still not something\n\n00:14:10.846 --> 00:14:12.383\nthat we should be proud of in Oklahoma City,\n\n00:14:12.383 --> 00:14:16.166\nbut we seem to have turned the cultural shift\n\n00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:19.247\nof making health a greater priority.\n\n00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:22.090\nAnd we love the idea of the demographics\n\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.900\nof highly educated twentysomethings,\n\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.669\npeople with choices, choosing Oklahoma City\n\n00:14:25.669 --> 00:14:27.118\nin large numbers.\n\n00:14:27.118 --> 00:14:29.411\nWe have the lowest unemployment\nin the United States,\n\n00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:32.283\nprobably the strongest economy in the United States.\n\n00:14:32.283 --> 00:14:33.913\nAnd if you're like me, at some point\n\n00:14:33.913 --> 00:14:36.285\nin your educational career,\n\n00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:38.502\nyou were asked to read a book called\n\n00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:41.347\n\"The Grapes of Wrath.\"\n\n00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:44.381\nOklahomans leaving for California\n\n00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:46.824\nin large numbers for a better future.\n\n00:14:46.824 --> 00:14:48.613\nWhen we look at the demographic shifts\n\n00:14:48.613 --> 00:14:49.773\nof people coming from the west,\n\n00:14:49.773 --> 00:14:51.401\nit appears that what we're seeing now\n\n00:14:51.401 --> 00:14:54.249\nis the wrath of grapes.\n\n00:14:54.249 --> 00:14:56.062\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.127\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:59.127 --> 00:15:03.672\nThe grandchildren are coming home.\n\n00:15:03.672 --> 00:15:05.460\nYou've been a great audience and very attentive.\n\n00:15:05.460 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/maysoon_zayid_i_got_99_problems_palsy_is_just_one", "transcript": "Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.(Cheering)Not good enough. Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?(Loud cheering)My name is Maysoon Zayid, and I am not drunk, but the doctor who delivered me was. He cut my mom six different times in six different directions, suffocating poor little me in the process. As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which means I shake all the time. Look. It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.(Laughter)CP is not genetic. It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it. No one put a curse on my mother's uterus, and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins, which they are.(Laughter)It only happens from accidents, like what happened to me on my birth day.Now, I must warn you, I'm not inspirational.(Laughter)And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dreamt of being disabled. Come on a journey with me. It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall, you're driving around in circles looking for parking, and what do you see? Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.(Laughter)And you're like, \"God, can't I just be a little disabled?\"(Laughter)Also, I've got to tell you, I've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.(Laughter)If there was an Oppression Olympics, I would win the gold medal. I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled, and I live in New Jersey.(Laughter)(Applause)If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.(Laughter)Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown. I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials. I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.A lot of people with CP don't walk, but my parents didn't believe in \"can't.\" My father's mantra was, \"You can do it, yes you can can.\"(Laughter) So, if my three older sisters were mopping, I was mopping. If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too, and if we didn't all get A's, we all got my mother's slipper.(Laughter)My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking. Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.(Laughter)My inner stripper was very strong.(Laughter)Yeah. No, by the first day of kindergarten, I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times.(Laughter)Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town, and they were all my family.(Laughter)Now there are 20 Arabs in town, and they are still all my family.(Laughter)I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.(Laughter)(Applause)This was before 9/11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use \"I hate Muslims\" as a campaign slogan. The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith. They did, however, seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan. I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.(Laughter)I have tap-danced on Broadway. Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.(Applause)My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dancing school. I learned how to dance in heels, which means I can walk in heels. And I'm from Jersey, and we are really concerned with being chic, so if my friends wore heels, so did I.And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore, I did not. I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer, we'd grow up to be Madonna.(Laughter)Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so I drank deer's milk, I had hot cups on my back, I was dunked in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, \"It's working! It's working!\"(Laughter)But one miracle cure we did find was yoga. I have to tell you, it's very boring, but before I did yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up. And now I can stand on my head. My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera \"General Hospital.\"(Laughter)I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU, Arizona State University, because I fit every single quota.(Laughter)I was like the pet lemur of the theater department. Everybody loved me. I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework, I got A's in all of my classes, A's in all of their classes.(Laughter)Every time I did a scene from \"The Glass Menagerie,\" my professors would weep. But I never got cast. Finally, my senior year, ASU decided to do a show called \"They Dance Real Slow in Jackson.\" It's a play about a girl with CP. I was a girl with CP. So I start shouting from the rooftops, \"I'm finally going to get a part! I have cerebral palsy! Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!\" I didn't get the part.(Laughter)Sherry Brown got the part. I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat, to ask her why, and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts. I said, \"Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts, neither can the character.\"(Laughter)(Applause)This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non-palsy actress. College was imitating life. Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.Upon graduating, I moved back home, and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera. My dream was coming true. And I knew that I would be promoted from \"Diner Diner\" to \"Wacky Best Friend\" in no time.(Laughter)But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head, and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors. They only hired perfect people. But there were exceptions to the rule. I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr, Ellen, and all of these women had one thing in common: they were comedians. So I became a comic.(Laughter)(Applause)My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with CP driving him.(Laughter)I've performed in clubs all over America, and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East, uncensored and uncovered.(Laughter)Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world. I never like to claim first, but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny, and they find us hysterical.(Laughter)In 2003, my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, now in its 10th year. Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media, while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.(Laughter)Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.My big break came in 2010. I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann.\" I walked in looking like I was going to the prom, and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.(Laughter)So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like, \"Excuse me, can I have another chair?\" And she looked at me and she went, \"Five, four, three, two ...\" And we were live, right? So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment, and when the interview was over, I was livid. I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it, and I knew I would never get invited back. But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back, he made me a full-time contributor, and he taped down my chair.(Laughter)(Applause)One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags.(Laughter) People say children are cruel, but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult. Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game. I would look at clips online and see comments like, \"Yo, why's she tweakin'?\" \"Yo, is she retarded?\" And my favorite, \"Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist. What does she suffer from? We should really pray for her.\" One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits: screenwriter, comedian, palsy.Disability is as visual as race. If a wheelchair user can't play Beyonc\u00e9, then Beyonc\u00e9 can't play a wheelchair user. The disabled are the largest \u2014 Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.(Applause)People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.The doctors said that I wouldn't walk, but I am here in front of you. However, if I grew up with social media, I don't think I would be. I hope that together, we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life. Perhaps if there were more positive images, it would foster less hate on the Internet. Or maybe not. Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places. I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Loreen Arbus. I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews. I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild. I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC. And I founded Maysoon's Kids, a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me. But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got \u2014 before this moment \u2014(Laughter)(Applause)But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, has Parkinson's and shakes just like me, Muhammad Ali.(Applause)(Applause ends)It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live, and I dedicate this talk to his memory.(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid, and if I can can, you can can.(Cheering)(Applause)", "id": 1898, "subtitle":

00:07:04.978\ncrying hysterically,\nlike someone shot my cat,\n\n00:07:05.002 --> 00:07:06.103\nto ask her why,\n\n00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:10.272\nand she said it was because\nthey didn't think I could do the stunts.\n\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.417\nI said, \"Excuse me,\nif I can't do the stunts,\n\n00:07:13.441 --> 00:07:14.998\nneither can the character.\"\n\n00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:19.166\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.910\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:27.938\nThis was a part\nthat I was literally born to play\n\n00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:32.221\nthey gave it to a non-palsy actress.\n\n00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:34.900\nCollege was imitating life.\n\n00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:37.336\nHollywood has a sordid history\n\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.353\nof casting able-bodied actors\nto play disabled onscreen.\n\n00:07:41.988 --> 00:07:44.757\nUpon graduating, I moved back home,\n\n00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:49.254\nand my first acting gig\nwas as an extra on a daytime soap opera.\n\n00:07:49.278 --> 00:07:51.074\nMy dream was coming true.\n\n00:07:51.098 --> 00:07:53.464\nAnd I knew that I would be promoted\n\n00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:56.987\nfrom \"Diner Diner\"\nto \"Wacky Best Friend\" in no time.\n\n00:07:57.011 --> 00:07:58.269\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:58.293 --> 00:08:00.920\nBut instead, I remained\na glorified piece of furniture\n\n00:08:00.944 --> 00:08:03.523\nthat you could only recognize\nfrom the back of my head,\n\n00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:05.122\nand it became clear to me\n\n00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:07.041\nthat casting directors\n\n00:08:07.065 --> 00:08:11.023\ndidn't hire fluffy,\nethnic, disabled actors.\n\n00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:13.071\nThey only hired perfect people.\n\n00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.410\nBut there were exceptions to the rule.\n\n00:08:15.768 --> 00:08:17.917\nI grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,\n\n00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:19.853\nRoseanne Barr, Ellen,\n\n00:08:19.877 --> 00:08:22.388\nand all of these women\nhad one thing in common:\n\n00:08:22.412 --> 00:08:23.650\nthey were comedians.\n\n00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:25.500\nSo I became a comic.\n\n00:08:25.524 --> 00:08:28.779\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:28.803 --> 00:08:31.792\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:35.469\nMy first gig was driving famous comics\n\n00:08:35.493 --> 00:08:38.048\nfrom New York City to shows in New Jersey,\n\n00:08:38.072 --> 00:08:41.533\nand I'll never forget the face\nof the first comic I ever drove\n\n00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:45.497\nwhen he realized that he was speeding\ndown the New Jersey Turnpike\n\n00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:47.694\nwith a chick with CP driving him.\n\n00:08:47.718 --> 00:08:48.719\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:48.743 --> 00:08:51.288\nI've performed in clubs all over America,\n\n00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:54.840\nand I've also performed\nin Arabic in the Middle East,\n\n00:08:54.864 --> 00:08:57.411\nuncensored and uncovered.\n\n00:08:57.435 --> 00:08:58.483\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:02.224\nSome people say I'm the first\nstand-up comic in the Arab world.\n\n00:09:02.248 --> 00:09:04.405\nI never like to claim first,\n\n00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:06.721\nbut I do know that they never heard\n\n00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:10.611\nthat nasty little rumor\nthat women aren't funny,\n\n00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:12.422\nand they find us hysterical.\n\n00:09:12.446 --> 00:09:13.897\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:19.528\nIn 2003, my brother\nfrom another mother and father\n\n00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:21.686\nDean Obeidallah and I started\n\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.054\nthe New York Arab-American\nComedy Festival,\n\n00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:26.028\nnow in its 10th year.\n\n00:09:26.052 --> 00:09:31.497\nOur goal was to change the negative image\nof Arab-Americans in media,\n\n00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:34.299\nwhile also reminding casting directors\n\n00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:37.064\nthat South Asian and Arab\nare not synonymous.\n\n00:09:37.088 --> 00:09:40.093\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.117 --> 00:09:46.013\nMainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier\n\n00:09:46.037 --> 00:09:50.394\nthan conquering the challenge\nagainst the stigma against disability.\n\n00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:53.130\nMy big break came in 2010.\n\n00:09:53.154 --> 00:09:56.044\nI was invited to be a guest\non the cable news show\n\n00:09:56.068 --> 00:09:58.376\n\"Countdown with Keith Olbermann.\"\n\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.378\nI walked in looking\nlike I was going to the prom,\n\n00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:03.512\nand they shuffle me into a studio\n\n00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:07.548\nand seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.\n\n00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:09.092\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:09.116 --> 00:10:10.942\nSo I looked at the stage manager\n\n00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:14.270\nand I'm like, \"Excuse me,\ncan I have another chair?\"\n\n00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:15.996\nAnd she looked at me and she went,\n\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.741\n\"Five, four, three, two ...\"\n\n00:10:18.765 --> 00:10:20.535\nAnd we were live, right?\n\n00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:22.903\nSo I had to grip onto the anchor's desk\n\n00:10:22.927 --> 00:10:26.692\nso that I wouldn't roll off\nthe screen during the segment,\n\n00:10:26.716 --> 00:10:29.551\nand when the interview\nwas over, I was livid.\n\n00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:31.717\nI had finally gotten\nmy chance and I blew it,\n\n00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.438\nand I knew I would never get invited back.\n\n00:10:34.946 --> 00:10:37.930\nBut not only did Mr. Olbermann\ninvite me back,\n\n00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:40.256\nhe made me a full-time contributor,\n\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.981\nand he taped down my chair.\n\n00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:45.672\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:48.937\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:52.654\nOne fun fact I learned while on the air\nwith Keith Olbermann\n\n00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:56.667\nwas that humans\non the Internet are scumbags.\n\n00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:57.692\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:57.716 --> 00:10:59.280\nPeople say children are cruel,\n\n00:10:59.304 --> 00:11:02.224\nbut I was never made fun of\nas a child or an adult.\n\n00:11:02.248 --> 00:11:05.919\nSuddenly, my disability\non the world wide web is fair game.\n\n00:11:05.943 --> 00:11:09.540\nI would look at clips online\nand see comments like,\n\n00:11:09.564 --> 00:11:12.200\n\"Yo, why's she tweakin'?\"\n\n00:11:12.224 --> 00:11:14.502\n\"Yo, is she retarded?\"\n\n00:11:14.526 --> 00:11:17.716\nAnd my favorite,\n\"Poor Gumby-mouth

suggested\nthat I add my disability to my credits:\n\n00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:29.975\nscreenwriter, comedian, palsy.\n\n00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:35.578\nDisability is as visual as race.\n\n00:11:36.078

Are you awake? They took my name tag, but I wanted to ask you, did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic? Anyone! No one? All right, no problem.Once upon a time, not long ago, I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend, ordering food. So I looked at the waiter and said, \"Do you have a menu (Arabic)?\" He looked at me strangely, thinking that he misheard. He said, \"Sorry? (English).\" I said, \"The menu (Arabic), please.\" He replied, \"Don't you know what they call it?\" \"I do.\" He said, \"No! It's called \"menu\" (English), or \"menu\" (French).\" Is the French pronunciation correct? \"Come, come, take care of this one!\" said the waiter. He was disgusted when talking to me, as if he was saying to himself, \"If this was the last girl on Earth, I wouldn't look at her!\" What's the meaning of saying \"menu\" in Arabic? Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant. How could she speak that way?At that moment, I started thinking. It made me mad. It definitely hurts! I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country? Where could this happen? How did we get here?Well, while we are here, there are many people like me, who would reach a stage in their lives, where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past, just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. Should I forget all my culture, thoughts, intellect and all my memories? Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war! Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform? To be one of them? Where's the logic in that? Despite all that, I tried to understand him. I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me.The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. It's not a language for science, research, a language we're used to in universities, a language we use in the workplace, a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project, and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport. If we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes. Where can I use it, then? We could all ask this question! So, you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so? This is one reality.But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about. Arabic is the mother tongue. Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue. Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages.How? Gibran Khalil Gibran, when he first started writing, he used Arabic. All his ideas, imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up, smelling a specific smell, hearing a specific voice, and thinking a specific thought. So, when he started writing in English, he had enough baggage. Even when he wrote in English, when you read his writings in English, you smell the same smell, sense the same feeling. You can imagine that that's him writing in English, the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. So, this is an example no one can argue with.Second, it's often said that if you want to kill a nation, the only way to kill a nation, is to kill its language. This is a reality that developed societies are aware of. The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese, all these nations are aware of this. That's why they legislate to protect their language. They make it sacred. That's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it. Do we know better than them?All right, we aren't from the developed world, this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet, and we would like to catch up with the civilized world. Countries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development, do research, and catch up with those countries, such as Turkey, Malaysia and others, they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder, protected it like a diamond. They kept it close to them. Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish, then it isn't a local product. You wouldn't believe it's a local product. They'd go back to being consumers, clueless consumers, like we are most of the time. So, in order for them to innovate and produce, they had to protect their language. If I say, \"Freedom, sovereignty, independence (Arabic),\" what does this remind you of? It doesn't ring a bell, does it? Regardless of the who, how and why.Language isn't just for conversing, just words coming out of our mouths. Language represents specific stages in our lives, and terminology that is linked to our emotions. So when we say, \"Freedom, sovereignty, independence,\" each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind, there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period.Language isn't one, two or three words or letters put together. It's an idea inside that relates to how we think, and how we see each other and how others see us. What is our intellect? How do you say whether this guy understands or not? So, if I say, \"Freedom, sovereignty, independence (English),\" or if your son came up to you and said, \"Dad, have you lived through the period of the freedom (English) slogan?\" How would you feel? If you don't see a problem, then I'd better leave, and stop talking in vain.The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing. I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man. I asked her once how things were going. She said, \"Everything is fine, but once, I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him.\" (Laughter) (Applause) The poor woman had mistakenly told him \"toqborni,\" and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. He was puzzled by the thought: \"How could anyone be this cruel? Does she want to commit suicide? 'Bury me?' (English)\" This is one of the few examples.It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband, since he won't understand, and he's right not to; his way of thinking is different. She said to me, \"He listens to Fairuz with me, and one night, I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz.\" The poor woman tried to translate this for him: \"From them I extended my hands and stole you \u2014\" (Laughter) And here's the pickle: \"And because you belong to them, I returned my hands and left you.\" (Laughter) Translate that for me. (Applause)So, what have we done to protect the Arabic language? We turned this into a concern of the civil society, and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language. Even though many people told me, \"Why do you bother? Forget about this headache and go have fun.\" No problem! The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says, \"I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West.\" We didn't say, \"No! We do not accept this or that.\" We didn't adopt this style because that way, we wouldn't be understood. And when someone talks to me that way, I hate the Arabic language. We say\u2014 (Applause)We want to change our reality, and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life. In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do. So, \"I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West\" has hit the spot. Something very easy, yet creative and persuasive. After that, we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground. You've seen an example of it outside, a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with \"Don't kill your language!\" written on it. Why? Seriously, don't kill your language. We really shouldn't kill our language. If we were to kill the language, we'd have to find an identity.We'd have to find an existence. We'd go back to the beginning. This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized.After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter. Photos of \"cool\" guys and girls. We are very cool! And to whoever might say, \"Ha! You used an English word!\" I say, \"No! I adopt the word 'cool.'\" Let them object however they want, but give me a word that's nicer and matches the reality better. I will keep on saying \"Internet\" I wouldn't say: \"I'm going to the world wide web\" (Laughs) Because it doesn't fit! We shouldn't kid ourselves. But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language, to control us or make us think and feel what they want.Creativity is the idea. So, if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on, we can be creative. At this moment, every one of you is a creative project. Creativity in your mother tongue is the path. Let's start from this moment. Let's write a novel or produce a short film. A single novel could make us global again. It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. So, it's not true that there's no solution; there is a solution! But we have to know that, and be convinced that a solution exists, that we have a duty to be part of that solution.In conclusion, what can you do today? Now, tweets, who's tweeting? Please, I beg of you, even though my time has finished, either Arabic, English, French or Chinese. But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers! (Applause) It's a disaster! That's not a language. You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language. It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise. That's the first thing we can do.Second, there are many other things that we can do. We're not here today to convince each other. We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language. Now I will tell you a secret. A baby first identifies its father through language. When my daughter is born, I'll tell her, \"This is your father, honey (Arabic).\" I wouldn't say, \"This is your dad, honey (English).\" And in the supermarket, I promise my daughter Noor, that if she says to me, \"Thanks (Arabic),\" I won't say, \"Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'\" and hope no one has heard her. (Applause)Let's get rid of this cultural cringe.(Applause)", "id": 1803, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:14.879\nGood morning!\n\n00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:17.847\nAre you awake?\n\n00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:20.941\nThey took my name tag,\nbut I wanted to ask you,\n\n00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.731\ndid anyone here write their name\non the tag in Arabic?\n\n00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:29.252\nAnyone! No one?\nAll right, no problem.\n\n00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:33.450\nOnce upon a time, not long ago,\n\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.972\nI was sitting in a restaurant with my friend,\nordering food.\n\n00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:41.955\nSo I looked at the waiter and said,\n\n00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.917\n\"Do you have a menu (Arabic)?\"\n\n00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:49.401\nHe looked at me strangely,\nthinking that he misheard.\n\n00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.664\nHe said, \"Sorry? (English).\"\n\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.508\nI said,\n\"The menu (Arabic), please.\"\n\n00:00:56.068 --> 00:00:59.361\nHe replied,\n\"Don't you know what they call it?\"\n\n00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:00.966\n\"I do.\"\n\n00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:04.576\nHe said, \"No! It's called \"menu\" (English),\nor \"menu\" (French).\"\n\n00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.571\nIs the French pronunciation correct?\n\n00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:09.011\n\"Come, come, take care of this one!\"\nsaid the waiter.\n\n00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:13.316\nHe was disgusted when talking to me,\nas if he was saying to himself,\n\n00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:17.358\n\"If this was the last girl on Earth,\nI wouldn't look at her!\"\n\n00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:19.465\nWhat's the meaning\nof saying \"menu\" in Arabic?\n\n00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:27.541\nTwo words made a Lebanese young man\njudge a girl as being backward\n\n00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.308\nand ignorant.\n\n00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:35.954\nHow could she speak that way?\n\n00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:38.989\nAt that moment, I started thinking.\n\n00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:40.065\nIt made me mad.\n\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.194\nIt definitely hurts!\n\n00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:44.349\nI'm denied the right to speak\nmy own language in my own country?\n\n00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.270\nWhere could this happen?\n\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.630\nHow did we get here?\n\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.462\nWell, while we are here,\nthere are many people like me,\n\n00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:57.040\nwho would reach a stage in their lives,\nwhere they involuntarily give up\n\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.378\neverything\nthat has happened to them in the past,\n\n00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:01.517\njust so they can say that they're modern\n\n00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:03.798\nand civilized.\n\n00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:06.703\nShould I forget all my culture, thoughts,\n\n00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:11.398\nintellect and all my memories?\n\n00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:14.953\nChildhood stories might be the best memories\nwe have of the war!\n\n00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:20.261\nShould I forget everything\nI learned in Arabic, just to conform?\n\n00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:23.546\nTo be one of them?\n\n00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:25.980\nWhere's the logic in that?\n\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.648\nDespite all that,\nI tried to understand him.\n\n00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:35.904\nI didn't want to judge him\nwith the same cruelty that he judged me.\n\n00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:39.670\nThe Arabic language\ndoesn't satisfy today's needs.\n\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.652\nIt's not a language for science,\n\n00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:43.173\nresearch,\n\n00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:45.192\na language we're used to in universities,\n\n00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:47.332\na language we use in the workplace,\n\n00:02:47.652 --> 00:02:53.756\na language we rely on if we were to perform\nan advanced research project,\n\n00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:56.513\nand it definitely isn't a language\nwe use at the airport.\n\n00:02:56.513 --> 00:02:59.318\nIf we did so,\nthey'd strip us of our clothes.\n\n00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:04.286\nWhere can I use it, then?\nWe could all ask this question!\n\n00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.938\nSo, you want us to use Arabic.\nWhere are we to do so?\n\n00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:11.088\nThis is one reality.\n\n00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:16.446\nBut we have another more important reality\nthat we ought to think about.\n\n00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:19.765\nArabic is the mother tongue.\n\n00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:25.650\nResearch says that mastery\nof other languages\n\n00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:29.172\ndemands mastery of the mother tongue.\n\n00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:36.302\nMastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite\nfor creative expression in other languages.\n\n00:03:36.472 --> 00:03:37.777\nHow?\n\n00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:39.857\nGibran Khalil Gibran,\n\n00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:44.348\nwhen he first started writing,\nhe used Arabic.\n\n00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:50.830\nAll his ideas, imagination and philosophy\n\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.547\nwere inspired by this little boy\nin the village\n\n00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:56.938\nwhere he grew up,\nsmelling a specific smell,\n\n00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:58.319\nhearing a specific voice,\n\n00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.944\nand thinking a specific thought.\n\n00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:04.745\nSo, when he started writing in English,\nhe had enough baggage.\n\n00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:07.143\nEven when he wrote in English,\n\n00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:10.934\nwhen you read his writings in English,\nyou smell the same smell,\n\n00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:12.829\nsense the same feeling.\n\n00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:16.691\nYou can imagine that that's him\nwriting in English,\n\n00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:22.035\nthe same boy who came from the mountain.\nFrom a village on Mount Lebanon.\n\n00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:29.049\nSo, this is an example\nno one can argue with.\n\n00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:33.939\nSecond, it's often said\nthat if you want to kill a nation,\n\n00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:36.799\nthe only way to kill a nation,\n\n00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:38.423\nis to kill its language.\n\n00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:43.953\nThis is a reality\nthat developed societies are aware of.\n\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.624\nThe Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese,\nall these nations are aware of this.\n\n00:04:50.834 --> 00:04:54.670\nThat's why they legislate\nto protect their language.\n\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.201\nThey make it sacred.\n\n00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:02.788\nThat's why they use it in production,\nthey pay a lot of money to develop it.\n\n00:05:03.298 --> 00:05:05.664\nDo we know better than them?\n\n00:05:06.074 --> 00:05:07.074\nAll right,\n\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.907\nwe aren't from the developed world,\n\n00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:11.125\nthis advanced thinking\nhasn't reached us yet,\n\n00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:13.859\nand we would like to catch up\nwith the civilized world.\n\n00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.182\nCountries that were once like us,\nbut decided to strive for development,\n\n00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:20.908\ndo research,\n\n00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:22.891\nand catch up with those countries,\n\n00:05:22.952 --> 00:05:25.731\nsuch as Turkey, Malaysia and others,\n\n00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:29.562\nthey carried their language with them\nas they were climbing the ladder,\n\n00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:32.969\nprotected it like a diamond.\n\n00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:34.598\nThey kept it close to them.\n\n00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:38.898\nBecause if you get any product\nfrom Turkey or elsewhere\n\n00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:41.064\nand it's not labeled in Turkish,\n\n00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:44.023\nthen it isn't a local product.\n\n00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:46.736\nYou wouldn't believe it's a local product.\n\n00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:49.598\nThey'd go back to being consumers,\n\n00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:55.111\nclueless consumers, like we are\nmost of the time.\n\n00:05:55.421 --> 00:06:01.292\nSo, in order for them to innovate and produce,\nthey had to protect their language.\n\n00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:07.479\nIf I say, \"Freedom, sovereignty,\nindependence (Arabic),\"\n\n00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.513\nwhat does this remind you of?\n\n00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:14.199\nIt doesn't ring a bell, does it?\n\n00:06:14.777 --> 00:06:18.478\nRegardless of the who, how and why.\n\n00:06:19.538 --> 00:06:25.616\nLanguage isn't just for conversing,\njust words coming out of our mouths.\n\n00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:30.458\nLanguage represents specific stages\nin our lives,\n\n00:06:30.648 --> 00:06:35.681\nand terminology\nthat is linked to our emotions.\n\n00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:38.113\nSo when we say,\n\"Freedom, sovereignty, independence,\"\n\n00:06:38.113 --> 00:06:41.523\neach one of you draws a specific image\nin their own mind,\n\n00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:44.332\nthere are specific feelings\n\n00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:46.959\nof a specific day\nin a specific historical period.\n\n00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:50.383\nLanguage isn't one, two\nor three words or letters put together.\n\n00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:53.297\nIt's an idea inside\nthat relates to how we think,\n\n00:06:53.297 --> 00:06:58.961\nand how we see each other\nand how others see us.\n\n00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:00.665\nWhat is our intellect?\n\n00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:03.457\nHow do you say\nwhether this guy understands or not?\n\n00:07:03.597 --> 00:07:11.326\nSo, if I say, \"Freedom, sovereignty,\nindependence (English),\"\n\n00:07:12.122 --> 00:07:14.111\nor if your son came up to you and said,\n\n00:07:14.223 --> 00:07:18.809\n\"Dad, have you lived through the period of\nthe freedom (English) slogan?\"\n\n00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:20.609\nHow would you feel?\n\n00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.423\nIf you don't see a problem,\n\n00:07:25.623 --> 00:07:29.102\nthen I'd better leave,\nand stop talking in vain.\n\n00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:34.558\nThe idea is that these expressions\nremind us of a specific thing.\n\n00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:40.544\nI have a francophone friend\nwho's married to a French man.\n\n00:07:40.904 --> 00:07:44.121\nI asked her once how things were going.\n\n00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:45.747\nShe said,\n\"Everything is fine,\n\n00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:50.328\nbut once, I spent a whole night\nasking and trying to translate\n\n00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:52.928\nthe meaning of the word\n'toqborni' for him.\"\n\n00:07:52.928 --> 00:07:54.317\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:57.453\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.321\nThe poor woman had mistakenly told him\n\"toqborni,\"\n\n00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:08.293\nand then spent the whole night\ntrying to explain it to him.\n\n00:08:08.293 --> 00:08:11.821\nHe was puzzled by the thought:\n\"How could anyone be this cruel?\n\n00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:13.737\nDoes she want to commit suicide?\n\n00:08:14.327 -->

I'm the one with the blond hair. My dad's the guy with the cigarette. It was the 60's. A lot of people smoked back then. In the summer of 2009, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody. If you're a man in the US, you've got about a one in two chance of being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime. If you're a woman, you've got about a one in three chance of being diagnosed with cancer. Everybody knows somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer.Now, my dad's doing better today, and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial of an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer. There are over 200 kinds of cancer. And what I want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad, because we have to change the way we think about raising money to fund cancer research.So a while after my dad was diagnosed, I was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo. He's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT, where I also have a position, and we were talking about cancer. And Andrew had been doing his own bits of research, and one of the things that he had been told and that he'd learned from studying the literature was that there's actually a big bottleneck. It's very difficult to develop new drugs, and the reason it's difficult to develop new drugs is because in the early stages of drug development, the drugs are very risky, and they're very expensive. So Andrew asked me if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit, work on some of the math and the analytics and see if we could figure out something we could do.Now I'm not a scientist. You know, I don't know how to build a drug. And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan \u2014 none of those guys are scientists either. We don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug. But we know a little bit about risk mitigation and a little bit about financial engineering, and so we started thinking, what could we do? I'm going to tell you about some work we've been doing over the last couple years that we think could fundamentally change the way research for cancer and lots of other things gets done. We want to let the research drive the funding, not the other way around.So in order to get started, let me tell you how you get a drug financed. Imagine that you're in your lab \u2014 you're a scientist, you're not like me \u2014 and you've developed a new compound that you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer. Well, what you do is, you test in animals, you test in test tubes, but there's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside, and in order to get from the bench, the lab, to the bedside, to the patients, you've got to get the drug tested. And the way the drug gets tested is through a series of, basically, experiments, through these large, they're called trials, that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things. So the FDA has a very specific protocol. In the first phase of this testing, which is called testing for toxicity, it's called Phase I. In the first phase, you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick. In other words, are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does, it's not going to be worth it? Does it cause heart attacks, kill people, liver failure? And it turns out, that's a pretty high hurdle. About a third of all drugs drop out at that point. In the next phase, you test to see if the drug's effective, and you give it to people with cancer and you see if it makes them better. And that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out. And in the third phase, you test it on a very large sample, and you're trying to determine what the right dose is, is it better than what's available today? If not, then why build it? When you're done with all that, what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side. So those blue bottles \u2014 those blue bottles save lives, and they're also worth billions, sometimes billions a year.So now here's a question: if I were to ask you, for example, to make a one-time investment of, say, 200 million dollars to buy one of those bottles, so 200 million dollars up front, one time, to buy one of those bottles, I won't tell you which one it is, and in 10 years, I'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones. Does that sound like a good deal for anybody? No. No, right? And of course, it's a very, very risky trial position, and that's why it's very hard to get funding, but to a first approximation, that's actually the proposal. You have to fund these things from the early stages on. It takes a long time.So Andrew said to me, he said, \"What if we stop thinking about these as drugs? What if we start thinking about them as financial assets?\" They've got really weird payoff structures and all that, but let's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them. Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets.Let's create a giant fund. In finance, we know what to do with assets that are risky. You put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns. So we did some math, and it turned out you could make this work, but in order to make it work, you need about 80 to 150 drugs.Now the good news is, there's plenty of drugs that are waiting to be tested. We've been told that there's a backlog of about 20 years of drugs that are waiting to be tested but can't be funded. In fact, that early stage of the funding process, that Phase I and preclinical stuff, that's actually, in the industry, called the Valley of Death because it's where drugs go to die. It's very hard to for them to get through there, and of course, if you can't get through there, you can't get to the later stages.So we did this math, and we figured out, OK, well, you need about 80 to, say, 150, or something like that, drugs. And then we did a little more math, and we said, OK, well, that's a fund of about three to 15 billion dollars. So we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one. We got rid of the risk, but now we need a lot of capital, and you can only get that kind of capital in the capital markets. Venture capitalists and philanthropies don't have it. But we have to figure out how to get people in the capital markets, who traditionally don't invest in this, to want to invest in this stuff. So again, financial engineering was helpful here. Imagine the megafund starts empty, and what it does is it issues some debt and some equity, and that generates cash flow. That cash flow is used, then, to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need, and those drugs start working their way through that approval process, and each time they go through a phase of approval, they gain value. Most of them don't make it, but a few of them do, and with the ones that gain value, you can sell some, and when you sell them, you have money to pay the interest on those bonds, but also to fund the next round of trials. It's almost self-funding. You do that for the course of the transaction, and when you're done, you liquidate the portfolio, pay back the bonds, and you can give the equity holders a nice return.That was the theory, and we talked about it, we did a bunch of experiments, and then we said, let's really try to test it. We spent the next two years doing research. We talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital. We talked to people who have developed drugs. We talked to pharmaceutical companies. We actually looked at the data for drugs, over 2,000 drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn, and we also ran millions of simulations. And all that actually took a lot of time. But when we were done, we found something that was sort of surprising. It was feasible to structure that fund such that when you were done structuring it, you could actually produce low-risk bonds that would be attractive to bond holders, that would give you yields of about five to eight percent, and you could produce equity that would give equity holders about a 12 percent return. Now those returns aren't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist. They want to make those big bets and get those billion dollar payoffs. But it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be interested. That's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and 401(k) plans and all this other stuff.So we published some articles in the academic press, in medical journals, in finance journals. But it wasn't until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we began to get some traction.We wanted to do more than just make people aware of it. We wanted people to get involved. So we took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open-source license to anybody that wanted it. And you guys can download it today if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work. And that was really effective, because people that didn't believe our assumptions could try their own and see how it would work.Now there's an obvious problem, which is, is there enough money in the world to fund this? I've told you there's enough drugs, but is there enough money? There's 100 trillion dollars of capital currently invested in fixed-income securities. That's a hundred thousand billion. There's plenty of money.(Laughter)But we realized it's more than just money that's required. We had to get people motivated, involved, and get them to understand this. And we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong. What are all the challenges that might get in the way? And we had a long list. We assigned a bunch of people, including ourselves, different pieces of this problem. And we said, could you start a work stream on credit risk? Could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects? Could you start a work stream on how you would manage so many projects? And we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams, and then we held a conference. The conference was held over this past summer. It was an invitation-only conference. It was sponsored by the American Cancer Society and done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute. We had experts from every field we thought would be important, including the government, and people that run research centers, and for two days they heard the reports from those five work streams, and talked about it. It was the first time the people who could make this happen sat across the table from each other and had these conversations.Now these conferences, it's typical to have a dinner, and at that dinner, you get to know each other, sort of like what we're doing here. I happened to look out the window, and hand on my heart, on the night of this conference \u2014 it was the summertime \u2014 and that's what I saw, a double rainbow. So I'd like to think it was a good sign.Since the conference, we've got people working between Paris and San Francisco, lots of different folks working on this to try to see if we can really make it happen. We're not looking to start a fund, but we want somebody else to do this. Because, again, I'm not a scientist. I can't build a drug. I'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials. But all of us together, with our 401(k)s, with our 529 plans, with our pension plans, all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials and get paid well for doing it and save millions of lives like my dad.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1901, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:19.112\nSo this is a picture of my dad and me,\nat the

research.\n\n00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.165\nSo a while after my dad was diagnosed,\n\n00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.964\nI was having coffee\nwith my friend Andrew Lo.\n\n00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:29.631\nHe's the head of the Laboratory\nfor Financial Engineering at MIT,\n\n00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.593\nwhere I also have a position,\n\n00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:33.219\nand we were talking about cancer.\n\n00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:35.637\nAnd Andrew had been doing\nhis own bits of research,\n\n00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.755\nand one of the things\nthat he had been told\n\n00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:42.224\nand that he'd learned\nfrom studying the literature\n\n00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.329\nwas that there's actually\na big bottleneck.\n\n00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.493\nIt's very difficult to develop new drugs,\n\n00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:48.877\nand the reason it's difficult\nto develop new drugs\n\n00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.322\nis because in the early stages\nof drug development,\n\n00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:53.851\nthe drugs are very risky,\nand they're very expensive.\n\n00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.748\nSo Andrew asked me\nif I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,\n\n00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:58.882\nwork on some of the math and the analytics\n\n00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:01.443\nand see if we could figure out\nsomething we could do.\n\n00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:03.543\nNow I'm not a scientist.\n\n00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.615\nYou know, I don't know\nhow to build a drug.\n\n00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:10.534\nAnd none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo\nor Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --\n\n00:02:10.558 --> 00:02:13.273\nnone of those guys are scientists either.\n\n00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:16.326\nWe don't know the first thing\nabout how to make a cancer drug.\n\n00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.985\nBut we know a little bit\nabout risk mitigation\n\n00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.125\nand a little bit\nabout financial engineering,\n\n00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.257\nand so we started thinking,\nwhat could we do?\n\n00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:25.847\nI'm going to tell you about some work\n\n00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.956\nwe've been doing\nover the last couple years\n\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.251\nthat we think could\nfundamentally change the way\n\n00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.148\nresearch for cancer\nand lots of other things gets done.\n\n00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:36.097\nWe want to let the research\ndrive the funding,\n\n00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.673\nnot the other way around.\n\n00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:39.698\nSo in order to get started,\n\n00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:41.845\nlet me tell you\nhow you get a drug financed.\n\n00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:46.270\nImagine that you're in your lab --\nyou're a scientist, you're not like me --\n\n00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.266\nand you've developed a new compound\n\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.146\nthat you think might be therapeutic\nfor somebody with cancer.\n\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.826\nWell, what you do is, you test in animals,\nyou test in test tubes,\n\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.910\nbut there's this notion\nof going from the bench to the bedside,\n\n00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.586\nand in order to get from the bench,\nthe lab, to the bedside, to the patients,\n\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.440\nyou've got to get the drug tested.\n\n00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:06.068\nAnd the way the drug gets tested\n\n00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:08.313\nis through a series of,\nbasically, experiments,\n\n00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.368\nthrough these large,\nthey're called trials,\n\n00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:12.747\nthat they do to determine\nwhether the drug is safe\n\n00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:14.784\nand whether it works and all these things.\n\n00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:16.888\nSo the FDA has a very specific protocol.\n\n00:03:16.912 --> 00:03:18.603\nIn the first phase of this testing,\n\n00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:22.236\nwhich is called testing for toxicity,\nit's called Phase I.\n\n00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.327\nIn the first phase,\nyou give the drug to healthy people\n\n00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.688\nand you see if it actually\nmakes them sick.\n\n00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.930\nIn other words, are the side\neffects just so severe\n\n00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:32.742\nthat no matter how much good it does,\n\n00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.224\nit's not going to be worth it?\n\n00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:36.939\nDoes it cause heart attacks,\nkill people, liver failure?\n\n00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:39.116\nAnd it turns out,\nthat's a pretty high hurdle.\n\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.502\nAbout a third of all drugs\ndrop out at that point.\n\n00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.480\nIn the next phase, you test\nto see if the drug's effective,\n\n00:03:44.504 --> 00:03:46.294\nand you give it to people with cancer\n\n00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:48.049\nand you see if it makes them better.\n\n00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:50.391\nAnd that's also a higher hurdle.\nPeople drop out.\n\n00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:53.221\nAnd in the third phase,\nyou test it on a very large sample,\n\n00:03:53.245 --> 00:03:56.353\nand you're trying to determine\nwhat the right dose is,\n\n00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:59.579\nis it better than what's available today?\nIf not, then why build it?\n\n00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.793\nWhen you're done with all that,\n\n00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:04.403\nwhat you have is a very small\npercentage of drugs\n\n00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:07.253\nthat start the process\nactually come out the other side.\n\n00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:10.991\nSo those blue bottles --\nthose blue bottles save lives,\n\n00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:14.075\nand they're also worth billions,\nsometimes billions a year.\n\n00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:16.333\nSo now here's a question:\n\n00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:19.599\nif I were to ask you, for example,\n\n00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:23.588\nto make a one-time investment of, say,\n200 million dollars\n\n00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:25.256\nto buy one of those bottles,\n\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.632\nso 200 million dollars up front, one time,\nto buy one of those bottles,\n\n00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:30.272\nI won't tell you which one it is,\n\n00:04:30.296 --> 00:04:34.197\nand in 10 years, I'll tell you whether\nyou have one of the blue ones.\n\n00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:36.352\nDoes that sound like a good\ndeal for anybody?\n\n00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.614\nNo. No, right?\n\n00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:40.172\nAnd of course, it's a very,\nvery risky trial position,\n\n00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.338\nand that's why it's very hard\nto get funding,\n\n00:04:42.362 --> 00:04:45.158\nbut to a first approximation,\nthat's actually the proposal.\n\n00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.792\nYou have to fund these things\nfrom the early stages on.\n\n00:04:47.816 --> 00:04:49.083\nIt takes a long time.\n\n00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:52.524\nSo Andrew said to me, he said,\n\n00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:54.994\n\"What if we stop thinking\nabout these as drugs?\n\n00:04:55.018 --> 00:04:57.804\nWhat if we start thinking\nabout them as financial assets?\"\n\n00:04:57.828 --> 00:05:00.472\nThey've got really weird payoff\nstructures and all that,\n\n00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:03.836\nbut let's throw everything we know\nabout financial engineering at them.\n\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.320\nLet's see if we can use\nall the tricks of the trade\n\n00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:09.691\nto figure out how to make these drugs\nwork as financial assets.\n\n00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:11.748\nLet's create a giant fund.\n\n00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:14.991\nIn finance, we know what to do\nwith assets that are risky.\n\n00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:18.127\nYou put them in a portfolio\nand you try to smooth out the returns.\n\n00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.194\nSo we did some math, and it turned out\nyou could make this work,\n\n00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:24.650\nbut in order to make it work,\nyou need about 80 to 150 drugs.\n\n00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:26.839\nNow the good news is,\nthere's plenty of drugs\n\n00:05:26.863 --> 00:05:28.323\nthat are waiting to be tested.\n\n00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:32.280\nWe've been told that there's a backlog\nof about 20 years of drugs\n\n00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:34.757\nthat are waiting to be tested\nbut can't be funded.\n\n00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.178\nIn fact, that early stage\nof the funding process,\n\n00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:39.174\nthat Phase I and preclinical stuff,\n\n00:05:39.198 --> 00:05:42.067\nthat's actually, in the industry,\ncalled the Valley of Death\n\n00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.828\nbecause it's where drugs go to die.\n\n00:05:43.852 --> 00:05:46.106\nIt's very hard to for them\nto get through there,\n\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.357\nand of course, if you can't\nget through there,\n\n00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.015\nyou can't get to the later stages.\n\n00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.091\nSo we did this math,\nand we figured out, OK,\n\n00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:55.413\nwell, you need about 80 to, say, 150,\nor something like that, drugs.\n\n00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:58.511\nAnd then we did a little more\nmath, and we said, OK,\n\n00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:01.797\nwell, that's a fund of about three\nto 15 billion dollars.\n\n00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.305\nSo we kind of created a new problem\nby solving the old one.\n\n00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:08.546\nWe got rid of the risk,\nbut now we need a lot of capital,\n\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.681\nand you can only get that kind\nof capital in the capital markets.\n\n00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.198\nVenture capitalists\nand philanthropies don't have it.\n\n00:06:14.222 --> 00:06:17.429\nBut we have to figure out\nhow to get people in the capital markets,\n\n00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:20.945\nwho traditionally don't invest in this,\nto want to invest in this stuff.\n\n00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.287\nSo again, financial engineering\nwas helpful here.\n\n00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:25.111\nImagine the megafund starts empty,\n\n00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:29.144\nand what it does is it issues\nsome debt and some equity,\n\n00:06:29.168 --> 00:06:30.564\nand that generates cash flow.\n\n00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:34.667\nThat cash flow is used, then, to buy\nthat big portfolio of drugs that you need,\n\n00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:38.004\nand those drugs start working their way\nthrough that approval process,\n\n00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.419\nand each time they go through\na phase of approval,\n\n00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:41.638\nthey gain value.\n\n00:06:41.662 --> 00:06:44.020\nMost of them don't make it,\nbut a few of them do,\n\n00:06:44.044 --> 00:06:46.550\nand with the ones that gain\nvalue, you can sell some,\n\n00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:47.812\nand when you sell them,\n\n00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:50.174\nyou have money to pay\nthe interest on those bonds,\n\n00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:52.249\nbut also to fund the next round of trials.\n\n00:06:52.273 --> 00:06:53.498\nIt's almost self-funding.\n\n00:06:53.522 --> 00:06:55.802\nYou do that for the course\nof the transaction,\n\n00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:58.255\nand when you're done,\nyou liquidate the portfolio,\n\n00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.601\npay back the bonds, and you can give\nthe equity holders a nice return.\n\n00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.800\nThat was the theory,\nand we talked about it,\n\n00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:05.294\nwe did a bunch of experiments,\n\n00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:07.486\nand then we said,\nlet's really try to test it.\n\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.394\nWe spent the next two years\ndoing research.\n\n00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:15.241\nWe talked to hundreds of experts\nin drug financing and venture capital.\n\n00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:17.931\nWe talked to people\nwho have developed drugs.\n\n00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:19.790\nWe talked to pharmaceutical companies.\n\n00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.644\nWe actually looked at the data for drugs,\n\n00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:26.840\nover 2,000 drugs that had been approved\nor denied or withdrawn,\n\n00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:29.215\nand we also ran millions of simulations.\n\n00:07:30.188 --> 00:07:32.718\nAnd all that actually took a lot of time.\n\n00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:36.035\nBut when we were done, we found something\nthat was sort of surprising.\n\n00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:37.885\nIt was feasible to structure that fund\n\n00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:40.001\nsuch that when you were done\nstructuring it,\n\n00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:43.964\nyou could actually produce low-risk bonds\nthat would be attractive to bond holders,\n\n00:07:43.988 --> 00:07:46.728\nthat would give you yields\nof about five to eight percent,\n\n00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:48.217\nand you could produce equity\n\n00:07:48.241 --> 00:07:50.936\nthat would give equity holders\nabout a 12 percent return.\n\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.342\nNow those returns aren't going\nto be attractive to a venture capitalist.\n\n00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:55.899\nThey want to make those big bets\n\n00:07:55.923 --> 00:07:57.716\nand get those billion dollar payoffs.\n\n00:07:57.953 --> 00:08:01.391\nBut it turns out there are lots of other\nfolks that would be interested.\n\n00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:04.994\nThat's right in the investment sweet spot\nof pension funds and 401(k) plans\n\n00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:06.316\nand all this other stuff.\n\n00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:09.117\nSo we published some articles\nin the academic press,\n\n00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:13.956\nin medical journals, in finance journals.\n\n00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.425\nBut it wasn't until we actually\ngot the popular press interested in this\n\n00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:19.654\nthat we began to get some traction.\n\n00:08:20.318 --> 00:08:22.914\nWe wanted to do more\nthan just make people aware of it.\n\n00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:24.518\nWe wanted people to get involved.\n\n00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:27.655\nSo we took all of our computer code\nand made that available online\n\n00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:30.367\nunder an open-source license\nto anybody that wanted it.\n\n00:08:30.391 --> 00:08:32.086\nAnd you guys can download it today\n\n00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.237\nif you want to run your own experiments\nto see if this would work.\n\n00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:36.746\nAnd that was really effective,\n\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.134\nbecause people that didn't\nbelieve our assumptions\n\n00:08:39.158 --> 00:08:41.309\ncould try their own\nand see how it would work.\n\n00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.319\nNow there's an obvious problem, which is,\n\n00:08:43.343 --> 00:08:45.618\nis there enough money\nin the world to fund this?\n\n00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:48.559\nI've told you there's enough drugs,\nbut is there enough money?\n\n00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.489\nThere's 100 trillion dollars of capital\n\n00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:53.507\ncurrently invested\nin fixed-income securities.\n\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.423\nThat's a hundred thousand billion.\n\n00:08:58.278 --> 00:08:59.885\nThere's plenty of money.\n\n00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:02.915\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:06.789\nBut we realized it's more than\njust money that's required.\n\n00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:08.813\nWe had to get people motivated, involved,\n\n00:09:08.837 --> 00:09:10.487\nand get them to understand this.\n\n00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:14.268\nAnd we started thinking about all\nthe different things that could go wrong.\n\n00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.154\nWhat are all the challenges\nthat might get in the way?\n\n00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:18.398\nAnd we had a long list.\n\n00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:21.401\nWe assigned a bunch of people,\nincluding ourselves,\n\n00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:23.011\ndifferent pieces of this problem.\n\n00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:26.679\nAnd we said, could you start\na work stream on credit risk?\n\n00:09:26.703 --> 00:09:29.348\nCould you start a work stream\non the regulatory aspects?\n\n00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:33.405\nCould you start a work stream\non how you would manage so many projects?\n\n00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:37.101\nAnd we had all these experts get together\nand do these different work streams,\n\n00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:38.973\nand then we held a conference.\n\n00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:41.227\nThe conference was held\nover this past summer.\n\n00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.031\nIt was an invitation-only conference.\n\n00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:45.305\nIt was sponsored\nby the American Cancer Society\n\n00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:48.738\nand done in collaboration\nwith the National Cancer Institute.\n\n00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:51.720\nWe had experts from every field\nwe thought would be important,\n\n00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:54.741\nincluding the government, and people\nthat run research centers,\n\n00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:57.202\nand for two days they heard the reports\n\n00:09:57.226 --> 00:09:59.818\nfrom those five work streams,\nand talked about it.\n\n00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:02.680\nIt was the first time the people\nwho could make this happen\n\n00:10:02.704 --> 00:10:05.771\nsat across the table from each other\nand had these conversations.\n\n00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:09.292\nNow these conferences,\nit's typical to have a dinner,\n\n00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:12.088\nand at that dinner,\nyou get to know each other,\n\n00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.853\nsort of like what we're doing here.\n\n00:10:13.877 --> 00:10:15.523\nI happened to look out the window,\n\n00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:16.843\nand hand on my heart,\n\n00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.679\non the night of this conference --\nit was the summertime --\n\n00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.947\nand that's what I saw, a double rainbow.\n\n00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:23.914\nSo I'd like to think it was a good sign.\n\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.241\nSince the conference, we've got people\nworking between Paris and San Francisco,\n\n00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:30.134\nlots of different folks working on this\n\n00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:32.609\nto try to see if we can\nreally make it happen.\n\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.293\nWe're not looking to start a fund,\nbut we want somebody else to do this.\n\n00:10:36.317 --> 00:10:38.487\nBecause, again, I'm not a scientist.\n\n00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:40.390\nI can't build a drug.\n\n00:10:40.414 --> 00:10:44.040\nI'm never going to have enough money\nto fund even one of those trials.\n\n00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:47.226\nBut all of us together, with our 401(k)s,\n\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.818\nwith our 529 plans,\nwith our pension plans,\n\n00:10:49.842 --> 00:10:52.725\nall of us together can actually\nfund hundreds of trials\n\n00:10:52.749 --> 00:10:54.333\nand get paid well for doing it\n\n00:10:54.357 --> 00:10:57.104\nand save millions of lives like my dad.\n\n00:10:57.128 --> 00:10:58.279\nThank you.\n\n00:10:58.303 --> 00:11:03.878\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why dieting doesn't usually work", "duration": "762", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sandra_aamodt_why_dieting_doesn_t_usually_work", "transcript": "Three and a half years ago, I made one of the best decisions of my life. As my New Year's resolution, I gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight, and learned to eat mindfully. Now I eat whenever I'm hungry, and I've lost 10 pounds.This was me at age 13, when I started my first diet. I look at that picture now, and I think, you did not need a diet, you needed a fashion consult. (Laughter) But I thought I needed to lose weight, and when I gained it back, of course I blamed myself. And for the next three decades, I was on and off various diets. No matter what I tried, the weight I'd lost always came back. I'm sure many of you know the feeling.As a neuroscientist, I wondered, why is this so hard? Obviously, how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn. What most people don't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain, mostly without your awareness. Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes, and that is a good thing, because your conscious mind \u2014 how do we put this politely? \u2014 it's easily distracted. It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie. You don't forget how to walk because you're thinking about what to have for dinner.Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh, no matter what you consciously believe. This is called your set point, but that's a misleading term, because it's actually a range of about 10 or 15 pounds. You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range, but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it. The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body weight, there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight, more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it, and the system works like a thermostat, responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism, to keep your weight stable as conditions change. That's what a thermostat does, right? It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside. Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter, but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat, which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up. Your brain works exactly the same way, responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal. If you lose a lot of weight, your brain reacts as if you were starving, and whether you started out fat or thin, your brain's response is exactly the same. We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not, but it can't. If you do lose a lot of weight, you become hungry, and your muscles burn less energy. Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed. That's a lot of food. This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin.From an evolutionary perspective, your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense. When food was scarce, our ancestors' survival depended on conserving energy, and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage. Over the course of human history, starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating. This may explain a very sad fact: Set points can go up, but they rarely go down. Now, if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair, this is the kind of thing she was talking about. (Laughter) Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point. Even after you've kept the weight off for as long as seven years, your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back. If that weight loss had been due to a long famine, that would be a sensible response. In our modern world of drive-thru burgers, it's not working out so well for many of us. That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available, and it's also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity.Sadly, a temporary weight gain can become permanent. If you stay at a high weight for too long, probably a matter of years for most of us, your brain may decide that that's the new normal.Psychologists classify eaters into two groups, those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower, like most dieters. Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters. The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight, and they spend less time thinking about food. Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising, super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet. And a small indulgence, like eating one scoop of ice cream, is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters. Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging. Several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later, even if they started at a normal weight, and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders. The other factor, by the way, those of you who are parents, was being teased by family members about their weight. So don't do that. (Laughter)I left almost all my graphs at home, but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one, because I'm a geek, and that's how I roll. (Laughter) This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14-year period based on four healthy habits: eating enough fruits and vegetables, exercise three times a week, not smoking, and drinking in moderation. Let's start by looking at the normal weight people in the study. The height of the bars is the risk of death, and those zero, one, two, three, four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had. And as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle, the less likely people were to die during the study. Now let's look at what happens in overweight people. The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death. Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range. For obese people with no healthy habits, the risk is very high, seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study. But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too. In fact, if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits, you can see that weight makes very little difference. You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle, even If you can't lose weight and keep it off.Diets don't have very much reliability. Five years after a diet, most people have regained the weight. Forty percent of them have gained even more. If you think about this, the typical outcome of dieting is that you're more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it.If I've convinced you that dieting might be a problem, the next question is, what do you do about it? And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness. I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga. I'm talking about mindful eating: learning to understand your body's signals so that you eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full, because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you're not hungry. How do you do it? Give yourself permission to eat as much as you want, and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good. Sit down to regular meals without distractions. Think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop, and let your hunger decide when you should be done. It took about a year for me to learn this, but it's really been worth it. I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life. I often don't think about it. I forget we have chocolate in the house. It's like aliens have taken over my brain. It's just completely different. I should say that this approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight unless you often eat when you're not hungry, but doctors don't know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people, and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss. Let's face it: If diets worked, we'd all be thin already. (Laughter) Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results? Diets may seem harmless, but they actually do a lot of collateral damage. At worst, they ruin lives: Weight obsession leads to eating disorders, especially in young kids. In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls say they've been on a diet. Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale. Even at its best, dieting is a waste of time and energy. It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project, and because willpower is limited, any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else.Let me leave you with one last thought. What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry? What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it? I think most of them would be happier and healthier, and as adults, many of them would probably be thinner. I wish someone had told me that back when I was 13.Thanks.(Applause)", "id": 1900, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.171\nThree and a

next shortage.\n\n00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:25.283\nOver the course of human history,\n\n00:04:25.283 --> 00:04:28.285\nstarvation has been a much bigger problem\n\n00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:29.969\nthan overeating.\n\n00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.200\nThis may explain a very sad fact:\n\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.029\nSet points can go up,\n\n00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:39.901\nbut they rarely go down.\n\n00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:42.090\nNow, if your mother ever mentioned\n\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.386\nthat life is not fair,\n\n00:04:44.386 --> 00:04:47.179\nthis is the kind of thing she was talking about.\n\n00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.217\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:50.217 --> 00:04:53.402\nSuccessful dieting doesn't lower your set point.\n\n00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:54.946\nEven after you've kept the weight off\n\n00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:56.775\nfor as long as seven years,\n\n00:04:56.775 --> 00:05:00.748\nyour brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.\n\n00:05:00.748 --> 00:05:04.038\nIf that weight loss had been due to a long famine,\n\n00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:06.367\nthat would be a sensible response.\n\n00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:09.048\nIn our modern world of drive-thru burgers,\n\n00:05:09.048 --> 00:05:12.505\nit's not working out so well for many of us.\n\n00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:16.248\nThat difference between our ancestral past\n\n00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:18.651\nand our abundant present\n\n00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.940\nis the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff\n\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.000\nof the University of Ottawa\n\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.701\nwould like to take some of his patients back to a time\n\n00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:27.800\nwhen food was less available,\n\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.501\nand it's also the reason\n\n00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:31.885\nthat changing the food environment\n\n00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:36.001\nis really going to be the most effective solution\n\n00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:38.111\nto obesity.\n\n00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:41.388\nSadly, a temporary weight gain\n\n00:05:41.388 --> 00:05:43.433\ncan become permanent.\n\n00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:46.067\nIf you stay at a high weight for too long,\n\n00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:48.541\nprobably a matter of years for most of us,\n\n00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:52.979\nyour brain may decide that that's the new normal.\n\n00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.039\nPsychologists classify eaters into two groups,\n\n00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.657\nthose who rely on their hunger\n\n00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:01.226\nand those who try to control their eating\n\n00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:07.289\nthrough willpower, like most dieters.\n\n00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:13.800\nLet's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.\n\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.983\nThe interesting thing is that intuitive eaters\n\n00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:18.614\nare less likely to be overweight,\n\n00:06:18.614 --> 00:06:22.316\nand they spend less time thinking about food.\n\n00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:25.960\nControlled eaters are more vulnerable\n\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.823\nto overeating in response to advertising,\n\n00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:32.686\nsuper-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.\n\n00:06:32.686 --> 00:06:34.431\nAnd a small indulgence,\n\n00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.637\nlike eating one scoop of ice cream,\n\n00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:43.247\nis more likely to lead to a food binge\n\n00:06:43.247 --> 00:06:45.144\nin controlled eaters.\n\n00:06:45.144 --> 00:06:47.071\nChildren are especially vulnerable\n\n00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:50.200\nto this cycle of dieting and then binging.\n\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.029\nSeveral long-term studies have shown\n\n00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:57.181\nthat girls who diet in their early teenage years\n\n00:06:57.181 --> 00:07:00.506\nare three times more likely to become overweight\n\n00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:02.043\nfive years later,\n\n00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:04.862\neven if they started at a normal weight,\n\n00:07:04.862 --> 00:07:07.511\nand all of these studies found\n\n00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:09.818\nthat the same factors\n\n00:07:09.818 --> 00:07:13.212\nthat predicted weight gain\n\n00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:16.212\nalso predicted the development of eating disorders.\n\n00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:17.780\nThe other factor, by the way,\n\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.209\nthose of you who are parents,\n\n00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:22.438\nwas being teased by family members\n\n00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:23.949\nabout their weight.\n\n00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.785\nSo don't do that.\n\n00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:27.523\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:30.159\nI left almost all my graphs at home,\n\n00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.452\nbut I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,\n\n00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.865\nbecause I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.\n\n00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:37.344\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:39.692\nThis is a study that looked at the risk of death\n\n00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.558\nover a 14-year period\n\n00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:44.060\nbased on four healthy habits:\n\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.180\neating enough fruits and vegetables,\n\n00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.406\nexercise three times a week,\n\n00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:49.782\nnot smoking,\n\n00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:51.752\nand drinking in moderation.\n\n00:07:51.752 --> 00:07:53.681\nLet's start by looking at the normal weight\n\n00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.269\npeople in the study.\n\n00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:57.156\nThe height of the bars is the risk of death,\n\n00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.537\nand those zero, one, two, three, four numbers\n\n00:07:59.537 --> 00:08:00.783\non the horizontal axis\n\n00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:02.816\nare the number of those healthy habits\n\n00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.376\nthat a given person had.\n\n00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:07.365\nAnd as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,\n\n00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:10.277\nthe less likely people were to die during the study.\n\n00:08:10.277 --> 00:08:11.599\nNow let's look at what happens\n\n00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.445\nin overweight people.\n\n00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:15.517\nThe ones that had no healthy habits\n\n00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:17.288\nhad a higher risk of death.\n\n00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.052\nAdding just one healthy habit\n\n00:08:19.052 --> 00:08:22.514\npulls overweight people back into the normal range.\n\n00:08:22.514 --> 00:08:25.256\nFor obese people with no healthy habits,\n\n00:08:25.256 --> 00:08:27.966\nthe risk is very high, seven times higher\n\n00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.102\nthan the healthiest groups in the study.\n\n00:08:30.102 --> 00:08:34.042\nBut a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.\n\n00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:36.560\nIn fact, if you look only at the group\n\n00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.834\nwith all four healthy habits,\n\n00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:41.446\nyou can see that weight makes very little difference.\n\n00:08:41.446 --> 00:08:43.502\nYou can take control of your health\n\n00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:45.376\nby taking control of your lifestyle,\n\n00:08:45.376 --> 00:08:46.857\neven If you can't lose weight\n\n00:08:46.857 --> 00:08:48.593\nand keep it off.\n\n00:08:48.593 --> 00:08:52.703\nDiets don't have very much reliability.\n\n00:08:52.703 --> 00:08:54.480\nFive years after a diet,\n\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.268\nmost people have regained the weight.\n\n00:08:57.268 --> 00:08:59.750\nForty percent of them have gained even more.\n\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.175\nIf you think about this,\n\n00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:03.522\nthe typical outcome of dieting\n\n00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:05.410\nis that you're more likely to gain weight\n\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.179\nin the long run than to lose it.\n\n00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:11.033\nIf I've convinced you that dieting\n\n00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:13.062\nmight be a problem,\n\n00:09:13.062 --> 00:09:15.700\nthe next question is, what do you do about it?\n\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.156\nAnd my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.\n\n00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:22.691\nI'm not saying you need to learn to meditate\n\n00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:24.683\nor take up yoga.\n\n00:09:24.683 --> 00:09:27.235\nI'm talking about mindful eating:\n\n00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:30.743\nlearning to understand your body's signals\n\n00:09:30.743 --> 00:09:33.132\nso that you eat when you're hungry\n\n00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:35.474\nand stop when you're full,\n\n00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.652\nbecause a lot of weight gain boils down\n\n00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:40.718\nto eating when you're not hungry.\n\n00:09:40.718 --> 00:09:42.202\nHow do you do it?\n\n00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.036\nGive yourself permission to eat\n\n00:09:44.036 --> 00:09:46.241\nas much as you want, and then work on figuring out\n\n00:09:46.241 --> 00:09:47.993\nwhat makes your body feel good.\n\n00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:51.722\nSit down to regular meals without distractions.\n\n00:09:51.722 --> 00:09:53.521\nThink about how your body feels\n\n00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:55.575\nwhen you start to eat and when you stop,\n\n00:09:55.575 --> 00:09:58.062\nand let your hunger decide\n\n00:09:58.062 --> 00:09:59.530\nwhen you should be done.\n\n00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.951\nIt took about a year for me to learn this,\n\n00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:03.722\nbut it's really been worth it.\n\n00:10:03.722 --> 00:10:06.807\nI am so much more relaxed around food\n\n00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:09.670\nthan I have ever been in my life.\n\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.235\nI often don't think about it.\n\n00:10:12.235 --> 00:10:14.968\nI forget we have chocolate in the house.\n\n00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:17.912\nIt's like aliens have taken over my brain.\n\n00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:20.670\nIt's just completely different.\n\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.336\nI should say that\n\n00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:26.129\nthis approach to eating probably\nwon't make you lose weight\n\n00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:29.046\nunless you often eat when you're not hungry,\n\n00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:32.944\nbut doctors don't know of any approach\n\n00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:37.419\nthat makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,\n\n00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:40.789\nand that is why a lot of people are now focusing on\n\n00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:42.948\npreventing weight gain\n\n00:10:42.948 --> 00:10:46.171\ninstead of promoting weight loss.\n\n00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:47.707\nLet's face it:\n\n00:10:47.707 --> 00:10:51.918\nIf diets worked, we'd all be thin already.\n\n00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:53.818\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:53.818 --> 00:10:55.455\nWhy do we keep doing the same thing\n\n00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:58.338\nand expecting different results?\n\n00:10:58.338 --> 00:11:00.021\nDiets may seem harmless,\n\n00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:03.739\nbut they actually do a lot of collateral damage.\n\n00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:06.174\nAt worst, they ruin lives:\n\n00:11:06.174 --> 00:11:08.490\nWeight obsession leads to eating disorders,\n\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.433\nespecially in young kids.\n\n00:11:11.433 --> 00:11:16.311\nIn the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls\n\n00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:18.088\nsay they've been on a diet.\n\n00:11:18.088 --> 00:11:20.349\nOur daughters have learned to measure their worth\n\n00:11:20.349 --> 00:11:23.452\nby the wrong scale.\n\n00:11:23.452 --> 00:11:25.477\nEven at its best,\n\n00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.205\ndieting is a waste of time and energy.\n\n00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:32.427\nIt takes willpower which you could be using\n\n00:11:32.427 --> 00:11:35.049\nto help your kids with their homework\n\n00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:38.665\nor to finish that important work project,\n\n00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:42.152\nand because willpower is limited,\n\n00:11:42.152 --> 00:11:46.775\nany strategy that relies on its consistent application\n\n00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:49.558\nis pretty much guaranteed\n\n00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.651\nto eventually fail you\n\n00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:55.500\nwhen your attention moves on to something else.\n\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.432\nLet me leave you with one last thought.\n\n00:11:59.432 --> 00:12:02.335\nWhat if we told all those dieting girls\n\n00:12:02.335 --> 00:12:05.336\nthat it's okay to eat when they're hungry?\n\n00:12:05.336 --> 00:12:07.586\nWhat if we taught them to work with their appetite\n\n00:12:07.586 --> 00:12:09.711\ninstead of fearing it?\n\n00:12:09.711 --> 00:12:13.138\nI think most of them would be happier and healthier,\n\n00:12:13.138 --> 00:12:15.153\nand as adults,\n\n00:12:15.153 --> 00:12:18.926\nmany of them would probably be thinner.\n\n00:12:18.926 --> 00:12:21.039\nI wish someone had told me that\n\n00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:24.460\nback when I was 13.\n\n00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.466\nThanks.\n\n00:12:26.466 --> 00:12:34.825\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to build an information time machine", "duration": "620", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/frederic_kaplan_how_i_built_an_information_time_machine", "transcript": "This is an image of the planet Earth. It looks very much like the Apollo pictures that are very well known. There is something different; you can click on it, and if you click on it, you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth. For instance, this is a bird's-eye view of the EPFL campus. In many cases, you can also see how a building looks from a nearby street. This is pretty amazing. But there's something missing in this wonderful tour: It's time. i'm not really sure when this picture was taken. I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's-eye view. In my lab, we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time. The kind of question we're asking is Is it possible to build something like Google Maps of the past? Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year, seeing how it was 100 years before, 1,000 years before? Is that possible? Can I reconstruct social networks of the past? Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages? So, can I build time machines? Maybe we can just say, \"No, it's not possible.\" Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view. This is what I call the information mushroom. Vertically, you have the time. and horizontally, the amount of digital information available. Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information. And obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have. If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past, or Facebook of the past, we need to enlarge this space, we need to make that like a rectangle. How do we do that? One way is digitization. There's a lot of material available \u2014 newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books. I can digitize all these. I can extract information from these. Of course, the more you go in the past, the less information you will have. So, it might not be enough. So, I can do what historians do. I can extrapolate. This is what we call, in computer science, simulation. If I take a log book, I can consider, it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey. I can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period. I'm extrapolating. If I have a painting of a facade, I can consider it's not just that particular building, but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information.So if we want to construct a time machine, we need two things. We need very large archives, and we need excellent specialists. The Venice Time Machine, the project I'm going to talk to you about, is a joint project between the EPFL and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.There's something very peculiar about Venice, that its administration has been very, very bureaucratic. They've been keeping track of everything, almost like Google today. At the Archivio di Stato, you have 80 kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of Venice over more than 1,000 years. You have every boat that goes out, every boat that comes in. You have every change that was made in the city. This is all there. We are setting up a 10-year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system. The type of objective we want to reach is 450 books a day that can be digitized. Of course, when you digitize, that's not enough, because these documents, most of them are in Latin, in Tuscan, in Venetian dialect, so you need to transcribe them, to translate them in some cases, to index them, and this is obviously not easy. In particular, traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts, they do not work well on the handwritten document. So the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain: speech recognition. This is a domain of something  that seems impossible, which can actually be done, simply by putting additional constraints. If you have a very good model of a language which is used, if you have a very good model of a document, how well they are structured. And these are administrative documents. They are well structured in many cases. If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features, then there's a chance of success.If we reach that stage, then there's something else: we can extract from this document events. Actually probably 10 billion events can be extracted from this archive. And this giant information system can be searched in many ways. You can ask questions like, \"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?\" \"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market in 1434?\" \"What was the salary of a glass maker in Murano maybe over a decade?\" You can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded. And then what you can do is put that in space, because much of this information is spatial. And from that, you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development over a thousand years, managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment. You can reconstruct that journey, visualize it in many different ways. But of course, you cannot understand  Venice if you just look at the city. You have to put it in a larger European context. So the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the European level. We can reconstruct also the journey of the Venetian maritime empire, how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea, how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time, controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south.But you can even do other things, because in these maritime routes, there are regular patterns. You can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system, create a Mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing, which would enable us to have  questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner.\"If I am in Corfu in June 1323 and want to go to Constantinople, where can I take a boat?\"Probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days' precision.\"How much will it cost?\"\"What are the chance of encountering pirates?\"Of course, you understand, the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying, quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process. There are errors everywhere, errors in the document, it's the wrong name of the captain, some of the boats never actually took to sea. There are errors in translation, interpretative biases, and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes, you're going to have errors in recognition, errors in extraction, so you have very, very uncertain data.So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies? How can we represent that form of uncertainty? It's difficult. One thing you can do is document each step of the process, not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta-historical information, how is historical knowledge constructed, documenting each step. That will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of Venice, but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of Venice. Maybe there's not a single map. Maybe there are several maps. The system should allow for that, because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty, which is really new for this type of giant databases.And how should we communicate this new research to a large audience? Again, Venice is extraordinary for that. With the millions of visitors that come every year, it's actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future. Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year, and vertically, you see the document that served the reconstruction, paintings, for instance. Imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year, some experience you could share within a group. On the contrary, imagine actually that you start from a document, a Venetian manuscript, and you show, actually, what you can construct out of it, how it is decoded, how the context of that document can be recreated. This is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in Geneva with that type of system.So to conclude, we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago. It's really a question of scale. We see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do, and this is really new for the humanities, which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers. When you visit the Archivio di Stato, you feel this is beyond what any single team can do, and that should be a joint and common effort. So what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of \"digital humanists\" that are going to be ready for this shift.I thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1902,

a nearby street.\n\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.562\nThis is pretty amazing.\n\n00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:42.989\nBut there's something missing in this wonderful tour:\n\n00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.177\nIt's time.\n\n00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:48.247\ni'm not really sure when this picture was taken.\n\n00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.659\nI'm not even sure it was taken\n\n00:00:49.659 -->

00:01:02.273\nbut also through time.\n\n00:01:02.273 --> 00:01:04.143\nThe kind of question we're asking is\n\n00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:05.536\nIs it possible to build something\n\n00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:07.714\nlike Google Maps of the past?\n\n00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:11.024\nCan I add a slider on top of Google Maps\n\n00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:12.827\nand just change the year,\n\n00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:14.618\nseeing how it was 100 years before,\n\n00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:16.287\n1,000 years before?\n\n00:01:16.287 --> 00:01:18.410\nIs that possible?\n\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.662\nCan I reconstruct social networks of the past?\n\n00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:23.711\nCan I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?\n\n00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:27.487\nSo, can I build time machines?\n\n00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.052\nMaybe we can just say, \"No, it's not possible.\"\n\n00:01:30.052 --> 00:01:33.862\nOr, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.\n\n00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:37.052\nThis is what I call the information mushroom.\n\n00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:38.635\nVertically, you have the time.\n\n00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:41.375\nand horizontally, the amount of digital information available.\n\n00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.857\nObviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.\n\n00:01:44.857 --> 00:01:48.405\nAnd obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.\n\n00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:50.723\nIf we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,\n\n00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:52.217\nor Facebook of the past,\n\n00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:53.791\nwe need to enlarge this space,\n\n00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.729\nwe need to make that like a rectangle.\n\n00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.239\nHow do we do that?\n\n00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.337\nOne way is digitization.\n\n00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.132\nThere's a lot of material available --\n\n00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:07.418\nnewspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.\n\n00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.186\nI can digitize all these.\n\n00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:11.923\nI can extract information from these.\n\n00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:15.466\nOf course, the more you go in the past,\nthe less information you will have.\n\n00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.112\nSo, it might not be enough.\n\n00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:20.520\nSo, I can do what historians do.\n\n00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.044\nI can extrapolate.\n\n00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:26.514\nThis is what we call, in computer science, simulation.\n\n00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:28.265\nIf I take a log book,\n\n00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.669\nI can consider, it's not just a log book\n\n00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.641\nof a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.\n\n00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:35.284\nI can consider it is actually a log book\n\n00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:37.866\nwhich is representative of\nmany journeys of that period.\n\n00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.111\nI'm extrapolating.\n\n00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:42.149\nIf I have a painting of a facade,\n\n00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.900\nI can consider it's not just that particular building,\n\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.832\nbut probably it also shares the same grammar\n\n00:02:48.832 --> 00:02:52.873\nof buildings where we lost any information.\n\n00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.731\nSo if we want to construct a time machine,\n\n00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:57.070\nwe need two things.\n\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.304\nWe need very large archives,\n\n00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.046\nand we need excellent specialists.\n\n00:03:02.046 -->

Literally", "duration": "389", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ryan_holladay_to_hear_this_music_you_have_to_be_there_literally", "transcript": "(Music) For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City, these shots might start to look familiar. This is Central Park, one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in America. But to anyone who hasn't visited, these images can't really fully convey. To really understand Central Park, you have to physically be there. Well, the same is true of the music, which my brother and I composed and mapped specifically for Central Park. (Music)I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing \u2014 That's us there. That's both of us actually \u2014 specifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years, this idea of location-aware music.Now, my brother and I, we're musicians and music producers. We've been working together since, well, since we were kids, really. But recently, we've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect, from creating sight-specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts.But today I want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space.But before I go too much further into that, let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea. My brother and I were living in New York City when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude did their temporary installation, The Gates, in Central Park. Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks, and unlike work that's exhibited in a more neutral space, like on the walls of a gallery or a museum, this was work that was really in dialogue with this place, and in a lot of ways, The Gates was really a celebration of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design. This was an experience that stayed with us for a long time, and years later, my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C., and we started to ask the question, would it be possible, in the same way that The Gates responded to the physical layout of the park, to compose music for a landscape? Which brought us to this.(Music)On Memorial Day, we released \"The National Mall,\" a location-aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device's built-in GPS functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of Washington, D.C. Hundreds of musical segments are geo-tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape, a musical score is actually unfolding around them. So this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park, but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener's chosen trajectory. So think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album.Let's take a closer look. Let's look at one example here. So using the app, as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the Washington Monument, you hear the sounds of instruments warming up, which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody. This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins. Keep walking, and a full choir joins in, until you finally reach the top of the hill and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness, as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park. But were you to walk in the opposite direction, this entire sequence happens in reverse. And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park, the music would fade to silence, and the play button would disappear.We're sometimes contacted by  people in other parts of the world who can't travel to the United States, but would like to hear this record. Well, unlike a normal album, we haven't been able to accommodate this request. When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version, we just can't make that happen, and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. In this case, the app is the work itself, and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience.Six months later, we did a location-aware album for Central Park, a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall, with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow to the Ramble to the Reservoir.Currently, my brother and I are working on projects all over the country, but last spring we started a project, here actually at Stanford's Experimental Media Art Department, where we're creating our largest location-aware album to date, one that will span the entirety of Highway 1 here on the Pacific Coast.But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music, is really just one idea. But it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age, that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model, but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1903, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:19.513\n(Music)\n\n00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:23.179\nFor any of you who have visited\nor lived in New York City,\n\n00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.074\nthese shots might start to look familiar.\n\n00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:29.758\nThis is Central Park,\n\n00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:31.494\none of the most beautifully designed\n\n00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:34.390\npublic spaces in America.\n\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.892\nBut to anyone who hasn't visited,\n\n00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:40.523\nthese images can't really fully convey.\n\n00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:42.568\nTo really understand Central Park,\n\n00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:45.727\nyou have to physically be there.\n\n00:00:45.727 --> 00:00:49.832\nWell, the same is true of the music,\n\n00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:52.629\nwhich my brother and I composed and mapped\n\n00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.715\nspecifically for Central Park.\n\n00:00:55.715 --> 00:01:00.773\n(Music)\n\n00:01:00.773 --> 00:01:03.599\nI'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work\n\n00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:06.756\nthat my brother Hays and I are doing --\n\n00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:10.202\nThat's us there.

silence,\n\n00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:43.629\nand the play button would disappear.\n\n00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.677\nWe're sometimes contacted by \npeople in other parts of the world\n\n00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.604\nwho can't travel to the United States,\n\n00:04:48.604 --> 00:04:50.755\nbut would like to hear this record.\n\n00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:53.398\nWell, unlike a normal album,\n\n00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:55.686\nwe haven't been able to accommodate this request.\n\n00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:58.684\nWhen they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,\n\n00:04:58.684 --> 00:05:00.880\nwe just can't make that happen,\n\n00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.058\nand the reason is because\n\n00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:05.043\nthis isn't a promotional app\n\n00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:07.492\nor a game to promote or accompany\n\n00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:09.777\nthe release of a traditional record.\n\n00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:13.511\nIn this case, the app is the work itself,\n\n00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:15.394\nand the architecture of the landscape\n\n00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:20.037\nis intrinsic to the listening experience.\n\n00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:22.905\nSix months later, we did a location-aware album\n\n00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.446\nfor Central Park,\n\n00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:27.718\na park that is over two times\nthe size of the National Mall,\n\n00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:30.102\nwith music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow\n\n00:05:30.102 --> 00:05:33.514\nto the Ramble to the Reservoir.\n\n00:05:33.514 --> 00:05:35.517\nCurrently, my brother and I are working on\n\n00:05:35.517 --> 00:05:37.834\nprojects all over the country,\n\n00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:40.082\nbut last spring we started a project,\n\n00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:41.743\nhere actually at Stanford's\n\n00:05:41.743 --> 00:05:44.335\nExperimental Media Art Department,\n\n00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:47.293\nwhere we're creating our largest\nlocation-aware album to date,\n\n00:05:47.293 --> 00:05:49.383\none that will span the entirety of Highway 1\n\n00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:51.673\nhere on the Pacific Coast.\n\n00:05:51.673 --> 00:05:55.823\nBut what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,\n\n00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.326\nis really just one idea.\n\n00:05:58.326 --> 00:06:00.664\nBut it speaks to a larger vision\n\n00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:02.813\nfor a music industry that's sometimes struggled\n\n00:06:02.813 --> 00:06:05.645\nto find its footing in this digital age,\n\n00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:08.110\nthat they begin to see these new technologies\n\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.355\nnot simply as ways of adding bells and whistles\n\n00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:12.212\nto an existing model,\n\n00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:13.950\nbut to dream up entirely new ways\n\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.667\nfor people to interact with\n\n00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.409\nand experience music.\n\n00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.453\nThank you.\n\n00:06:19.453 -->

entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and I did business in, and, in fact, continue to do business in, was built around what probably Milton Friedman put more succinctly. And Adam Smith, of course,  the father of modern economics actually said many, many years ago, the invisible hand, which is, \"If you continue to operate in your own self-interest you will do the best good for society.\"Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things and I've talked about a lot of good  things that have happened, but equally, it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we've seen in society. The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth: growth that is consistent, quarter on quarter; growth that is competitive, better than the other person; and growth that is profitable, so you continue to make more and more shareholder value. And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this 3G model to a model of what I call the fourth G: the G of growth that is responsible. And it is this that has to become a very important part of creating value. Of not just creating economic value but creating social value. And companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth G. And the model of 4G is quite simple: Companies cannot afford  to be just innocent bystanders in what's happening around in society. They have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them. And we have to move to a model of an and/and model which is how do we make money and do good? How do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us? And that model is all about doing well and doing good.But the question is easier said than done. But how do we actually get that done? And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership. It is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things. And for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell. And companies that actually define a true north, things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good, bad, ugly \u2014 doesn't matter. There are things that you stand for. Values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow.And I'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences. I joined Unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in India. And on my first day of work I walked in and my boss tells me, \"Do you know why you're here?\" I said, \"I'm here to sell a lot of soap.\" And he said,  \"No, you're here to change lives.\" You're here to change lives. You know, I thought it was rather facetious. We are a company that sells soap and soup. What are we doing about changing lives? And it's then I realized that simple acts like selling a bar of soap can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies. I don't know how many of you know that five million children don't reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap.We run the largest hand-washing program in the world. We are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people. It's not about selling soap, there is a larger purpose out there. And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change. And the reason for that is, when two billion people use your brands that's the amplifier. Small actions can make a big difference.Take another example, I was walking around in  one of our villages in India. Now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park. And we had this lady who was one of our small distributors \u2014 beautiful, very, very modest, her home \u2014 and she was out there, dressed nicely, her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind and her sister-in-law behind her. The social order was changing because this lady is part of our Project Shakti that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene. We have 60,000 such women now in India.It's not about selling soap, it's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people's lives. Small actions, big difference.Our R&D folks are not only working to give us  some fantastic detergents, but they're working to make sure we use less water. A product that we've just launched recently, One Rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes. And if we can convert all our users to using this, that's 500 billion liters of water. By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent. So just think about it. There are small actions that  can make a big difference.And I can go on and on. Our food chain, our brilliant products \u2014 and I'm sorry I'm giving you  a word from the sponsors \u2014 Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products. We are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources, 100-percent sustainable sources.We were the first to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources. I don't know how many of you know that palm oil, and not buying it from sustainable sources, can create deforestation that is responsible for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world. We were the first to embrace that, and it's all because we market soap and soup. And the point I'm making here is that companies like yours, companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate.We introduced something called The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said, \"Our purpose is to make  sustainable living commonplace, and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over 2020.\" Now the question here is, where do we go from here? And the answer to that is very simple: We're not going to change the world alone. There are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this. The question is, we need partnerships, we need coalitions and importantly, we need that leadership that will allow us to take this from here and to be the change that we want to see around us. Thank you very much.

birthplace of the needle and syringe. Less than a mile from here in this direction, in 1853 a Scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe. His name was Alexander Wood, and it was at the Royal College of Physicians. This is the patent. What blows my mind when I look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today. Yet, it's 160 years old.So we turn to the field of vaccines. Most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe,  this 160-year-old technology. And credit where it's due \u2014 on many levels, vaccines are a successful technology. After clean water and sanitation, vaccines are the one technology that has increased our life span the most. That's a pretty hard act to beat.But just like any other technology, vaccines have their shortcomings, and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative \u2014 this old technology. So let's start with the obvious: Many of us don't like the needle and syringe. I share that view. However, 20 percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia. That's more than disliking the needle; that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia. And that's problematic in terms  of the rollout of vaccines.Now, related to this is another key issue, which is needlestick injuries. And the WHO has figures that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year take place due to cross-contamination with needlestick injuries. These are early deaths that take place.Now, these are two things that  you probably may have heard of, but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you  may not have heard about. One is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses. And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well.I'm going to tell you about some work that my team and I are doing in Australia at the University of Queensland on a technology designed to  tackle those four problems. And that technology is called the Nanopatch. Now, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch. To the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp, but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye. And there's about 4,000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle. And I've designed those projections to serve a key role, which is to  work with the skin's immune system. So that's a very important function tied in with the Nanopatch.Now we make the Nanopatch with a technique called deep reactive ion etching. And this particular technique  is one that's been borrowed from the semiconductor industry, and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers.Now we dry-coat vaccines to  the projections of the Nanopatch and apply it to the skin. Now, the simplest form of application is using our finger, but our finger has some limitations, so we've devised an applicator. And it's a very simple device \u2014 you could call it a sophisticated finger. It's a spring-operated device. What we do is when we apply  the Nanopatch to the skin as so \u2014 (Click) \u2014 immediately a few things happen. So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released \u2014 within less than a minute, in fact. Then we can take the Nanopatch off and discard it. And indeed we can make  a reuse of the applicator itself.So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch, and immediately you can see some key advantages. We've talked about it being needle-free \u2014 these are projections that you can't even see \u2014 and, of course, we get around the needle phobia issue as well.Now, if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages: One is improved immune  responses through delivery, and the second is getting rid of the cold chain.So let's start with the first one,  this immunogenicity idea. It takes a little while to get our heads around, but I'll try to explain it in simple terms. So I'll take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way. So vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ. Now that safe germ, that antigen, tricks our body into mounting an immune response, learning and remembering  how to deal with intruders. When the real intruder comes along the body quickly mounts an immune response to deal with that vaccine and neutralizes the infection. So it does that well.Now, the way it's done today  with the needle and syringe, most vaccines are delivered that way \u2014 with this old technology and the needle. But it could be argued that the needle  is holding back our immune responses; it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin. To describe this idea, we need to take a journey through the skin, starting with one of those projections and applying the Nanopatch to the skin. And we see this kind of data. Now, this is real data \u2014 that thing that we can see there is one projection from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers. Now, to give you an idea of scale, if the needle was shown here, it would be too big. It would be 10 times bigger than the size of that screen, going 10 times deeper as well. It's off the grid entirely. You can see immediately that we  have those projections in the skin. That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin, but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of immune cells. As one example, in the brown layer there's a certain type of cell  called a Langerhans cell \u2014 every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those Langerhans cells, those immune cells, and  there's others shown as well that we haven't stained in this image. But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed. We target thousands upon thousands  of these particular cells just residing within a hair's width of the surface of the skin.Now, as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that, I found that exciting. But so what? So what if you've targeted cells? In the world of vaccines, what does that mean? The world of vaccines is getting better. It's getting more systematic. However, you still don't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait. It's a gambler's game even today.So, we had to do that gamble. We obtained an influenza vaccine, we applied it to our Nanopatches and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin, and we waited \u2014 and this is in the live animal. We waited a month, and this is what we found out. This is a data slide showing the immune responses that we've generated with a Nanopatch compared to the needle and syringe into muscle. So on the horizontal axis we have  the dose shown in nanograms. On the vertical axis we have  the immune response generated, and that dashed line indicates  the protection threshold. If we're above that line it's considered protective; if we're below that line it's not. So the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there's only one point that  is achieved with the needle that's protective, and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms. But notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line. That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch; the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve. That's a real fresh opportunity. Suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines. We can push it one way, where we can take a vaccine  that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose  compared to the needle. That can take a vaccine that's suddenly  10 dollars down to 10 cents, and that's particularly important  within the developing world.But there's another angle to this as well \u2014 you can take vaccines that currently don't work and get them over that line and get them protective. And certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important. Let's consider the big three: HIV, malaria, tuberculosis. They're responsible for about  7 million deaths per year, and there is no adequate vaccination  method for any of those. So potentially, with this new lever  that we have with the Nanopatch, we can help make that happen. We can push that lever to help get those  candidate vaccines over the line. Now, of course, we've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this, what we've achieved with influenza.I'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today's vaccines, and that is the need to maintain the cold chain. As the name suggests \u2014 the cold chain \u2014 it's the requirements of keeping  a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied, to keep it refrigerated. Now, that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it. This is a slightly extreme case in point but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges, in particular in resource-poor settings, of what's required to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain. If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down, but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well.Now, the stakes are very high. The WHO estimates that within Africa, up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the  cold chain has fallen over. So it's a big problem, and it's tied  in with the needle and syringe because it's a liquid form vaccine, and  when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.A key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry, and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration. Within my lab we've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius for more than a year without  any loss in activity at all. That's an important improvement. (Applause) We're delighted about it as well. And the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting. And as a scientist, I love that and I love science. However, as an engineer, as a biomedical engineer and also as a human being, I'm not going to be satisfied until we've rolled this thing  out, taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most.So we've commenced this particular journey, and we've commenced this  journey in an unusual way. We've started with Papua New Guinea.Now, Papua New Guinea is an example  of a developing world country. It's about the same size as France, but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today's vaccines. There's the logistics: Within this country there are only 800  refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled. Many of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby, many of them are breaking down and many are not in the Highlands  where they are required. That's a challenge. But also, Papua New Guinea has the  world's highest incidence of HPV, human papillomavirus, the  cervical cancer [risk factor]. Yet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it's too expensive. So for those two reasons, with  the attributes of the Nanopatch, we've got into the field and  worked with the Nanopatch, and taken it to Papua New Guinea and we'll be following that up shortly.Now, doing this kind of work is not easy. It's challenging, but there's nothing else in  the world I'd rather be doing. And as we look ahead I'd like to share with you a thought: It's the thought of a future where the 17 million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote. And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved by improved, radically improved vaccines. Now standing here today in front of you at the birthplace of the needle and syringe, a device that's 160 years old, I'm presenting to you an alternative approach that could really help make that happen \u2014 and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes  of being needle-free, pain-free, the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity. Thank you.

and syringe you \nmay not have heard about.\n\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.861\nOne is it could be holding back\n\n00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.340\nthe next generation of vaccines\n\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.629\nin terms of their immune responses.\n\n00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.556\nAnd the second is that it could be responsible\n\n00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:24.168\nfor the problem of the cold chain\nthat I'll tell you about as well.\n\n00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:25.750\nI'm going to tell you about some work\n\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.818\nthat my team and I are doing in Australia\n\n00:02:27.818 --> 00:02:29.559\nat the University of Queensland\n\n00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:33.956\non a technology designed to \ntackle those four problems.\n\n00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:38.301\nAnd that technology is called the Nanopatch.\n\n00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:44.775\nNow, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.\n\n00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:46.424\nTo the naked eye\n\n00:02:46.424 --> 00:02:48.608\nit just looks like a square\n\n00:02:48.608 --> 00:02:51.507\nsmaller than a postage stamp,\n\n00:02:51.507 --> 00:02:54.173\nbut under a microscope\n\n00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.491\nwhat you see are thousands of tiny projections\n\n00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:58.712\nthat are invisible to the human eye.\n\n00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:00.469\nAnd there's about 4,000 projections\n\n00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.851\non this particular square compared to the needle.\n\n00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:06.509\nAnd I've designed those projections\n\n00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:10.559\nto serve a key role, which is to \nwork with the skin's immune system.\n\n00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.954\nSo that's a very important function\n\n00:03:12.954 --> 00:03:14.410\ntied in with the Nanopatch.\n\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.657\nNow we make the Nanopatch\n\n00:03:16.657 --> 00:03:19.194\nwith a technique\n\n00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.573\ncalled deep reactive ion etching.\n\n00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:23.617\nAnd this particular technique \nis one that's been borrowed\n\n00:03:23.617 --> 00:03:25.244\nfrom the semiconductor industry,\n\n00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:27.080\nand therefore is low cost\n\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.274\nand can be rolled out in large numbers.\n\n00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:34.340\nNow we dry-coat vaccines to \nthe projections of the Nanopatch\n\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.159\nand apply it to the skin.\n\n00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.715\nNow, the simplest form of application\n\n00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:42.737\nis using our finger,\n\n00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:45.357\nbut our finger has some limitations,\n\n00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:47.441\nso we've devised an applicator.\n\n00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:48.928\nAnd it's a very simple device --\n\n00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.046\nyou could call it a sophisticated finger.\n\n00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:54.086\nIt's a spring-operated device.\n\n00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:57.908\nWhat we do is when we apply \nthe Nanopatch to the skin as so --\n\n00:03:57.908 --> 00:03:59.777\n(Click) --\n\n00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:02.694\nimmediately a few things happen.\n\n00:04:02.694 --> 00:04:06.741\nSo firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch\n\n00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:08.418\nbreach through the tough outer layer\n\n00:04:08.418 --> 00:04:10.464\nand the vaccine is very quickly released --\n\n00:04:10.464 --> 00:04:12.812\nwithin less than a minute, in fact.\n\n00:04:12.812 --> 00:04:15.378\nThen we can take the Nanopatch off\n\n00:04:15.378 --> 00:04:17.316\nand discard it.\n\n00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:23.202\nAnd indeed we can make \na reuse of the applicator itself.\n\n00:04:23.202 --> 00:04:25.938\nSo that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,\n\n00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:28.514\nand immediately you can see some key advantages.\n\n00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:30.454\nWe've talked about it being needle-free --\n\n00:04:30.454 --> 00:04:32.688\nthese are projections that you can't even see --\n\n00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:34.399\nand, of course, we get around\n\n00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.472\nthe needle phobia issue as well.\n\n00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:39.403\nNow, if we take a step back and think about\n\n00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:42.799\nthese other two really important advantages:\n\n00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.835\nOne is improved immune \nresponses through delivery,\n\n00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:50.429\nand the second is getting rid of the cold chain.\n\n00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:52.801\nSo let's start with the first one, \nthis immunogenicity idea.\n\n00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:54.807\nIt takes a little while to get our heads around,\n\n00:04:54.807 --> 00:04:58.536\nbut I'll try to explain it in simple terms.\n\n00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.386\nSo I'll take a step back and explain to you\n\n00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:03.796\nhow vaccines work in a simple way.\n\n00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:06.373\nSo vaccines work by introducing into our body\n\n00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:08.476\na thing called an antigen\n\n00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:11.653\nwhich is a safe form of a germ.\n\n00:05:11.653 --> 00:05:13.673\nNow that safe germ, that antigen,\n\n00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:17.178\ntricks our body into mounting an immune response,\n\n00:05:17.178 --> 00:05:21.246\nlearning and remembering \nhow to deal with intruders.\n\n00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:23.614\nWhen the real intruder comes along\n\n00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:25.375\nthe body quickly mounts an immune response\n\n00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:27.011\nto deal with that vaccine\n\n00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.911\nand neutralizes the infection.\n\n00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:30.601\nSo it does that well.\n\n00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:32.938\nNow, the way it's done today \nwith the needle and syringe,\n\n00:05:32.938 --> 00:05:35.389\nmost vaccines are delivered that way --\n\n00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.073\nwith this old technology and the needle.\n\n00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:42.222\nBut it could be argued that the needle \nis holding back our immune responses;\n\n00:05:42.222 --> 00:05:45.664\nit's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.\n\n00:05:45.664 --> 00:05:48.660\nTo describe this idea,\n\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.149\nwe need to take a journey through the skin,\n\n00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.773\nstarting with one of those projections\n\n00:05:53.773 --> 00:05:56.218\nand applying the Nanopatch to the skin.\n\n00:05:56.218 --> 00:05:58.618\nAnd we see this kind of data.\n\n00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:00.427\nNow, this is real data --\n\n00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:02.773\nthat thing that we can see there is one projection\n\n00:06:02.773 --> 00:06:05.229\nfrom the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin\n\n00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.154\nand those colors are different layers.\n\n00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:08.438\nNow, to give you an idea of scale,\n\n00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:10.378\nif the needle was shown here, it would be too big.\n\n00:06:10.378 --> 00:06:11.903\nIt would be 10 times bigger\n\n00:06:11.903 --> 00:06:14.825\nthan the size of that screen,\ngoing 10 times deeper as well.\n\n00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:17.040\nIt's off the grid entirely.\n\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.233\nYou can see immediately that we \nhave those projections in the skin.\n\n00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:23.285\nThat red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,\n\n00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:25.792\nbut the brown layer and the magenta layer\n\n00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:28.980\nare jammed full of immune cells.\n\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.836\nAs one example, in the brown layer\n\n00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:33.190\nthere's a certain type of cell \ncalled a Langerhans cell --\n\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.403\nevery square millimeter of our body\n\n00:06:35.403 --> 00:06:38.423\nis jammed full of those Langerhans cells,\n\n00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:40.526\nthose immune cells, and \nthere's others shown as well\n\n00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:42.321\nthat we haven't stained in this image.\n\n00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:44.501\nBut you can immediately see that the Nanopatch\n\n00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:46.238\nachieves that penetration indeed.\n\n00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:49.667\nWe target thousands upon thousands \nof these particular cells\n\n00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:52.005\njust residing within a hair's width\n\n00:06:52.005 --> 00:06:55.286\nof the surface of the skin.\n\n00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:59.048\nNow, as the guy that's invented\nthis thing and designed it to do that,\n\n00:06:59.048 --> 00:07:02.484\nI found that exciting. But so what?\n\n00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:04.436\nSo what if you've targeted cells?\n\n00:07:04.436 --> 00:07:07.239\nIn the world of vaccines, what does that mean?\n\n00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:09.660\nThe world of vaccines is getting better.\n\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.384\nIt's getting more systematic.\n\n00:07:11.384 --> 00:07:13.606\nHowever, you still don't really know\n\n00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:15.350\nif a vaccine is going to work\n\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.689\nuntil you roll your sleeves up\n\n00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.904\nand vaccinate and wait.\n\n00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:21.606\nIt's a gambler's game even today.\n\n00:07:21.606 --> 00:07:24.118\nSo, we had to do that gamble.\n\n00:07:24.118 --> 00:07:26.598\nWe obtained an influenza vaccine,\n\n00:07:26.598 --> 00:07:28.214\nwe applied it to our Nanopatches\n\n00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.685\nand we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,\n\n00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:32.418\nand we waited --\n\n00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.246\nand this is in the live animal.\n\n00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:36.097\nWe waited a month,\n\n00:07:36.097 --> 00:07:37.909\nand this is what we found out.\n\n00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:40.234\nThis is a data slide showing the immune responses\n\n00:07:40.234 --> 00:07:42.557\nthat we've generated with a Nanopatch\n\n00:07:42.557 --> 00:07:46.333\ncompared to the needle and syringe into muscle.\n\n00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:49.927\nSo on the horizontal axis we have \nthe dose shown in nanograms.\n\n00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.632\nOn the vertical axis we have \nthe immune response generated,\n\n00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:58.147\nand that dashed line indicates \nthe protection threshold.\n\n00:07:58.147 --> 00:08:00.600\nIf we're above that line it's considered protective;\n\n00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.526\nif we're below that line it's not.\n\n00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:06.094\nSo the red line is mostly below that curve\n\n00:08:06.094 --> 00:08:09.618\nand indeed there's only one point that \nis achieved with the needle that's protective,\n\n00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:12.827\nand that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.\n\n00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:15.360\nBut notice immediately the distinctly different curve\n\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.424\nthat we achieve with the blue line.\n\n00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:20.324\nThat's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;\n\n00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:22.061\nthe delivered dose of the Nanopatch is\n\n00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:25.422\na completely different immunogenicity curve.\n\n00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.255\nThat's a real fresh opportunity.\n\n00:08:27.255 --> 00:08:29.633\nSuddenly we have a brand new lever\n\n00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:31.161\nin the world of vaccines.\n\n00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:32.672\nWe can push it one way,\n\n00:08:32.672 --> 00:08:35.263\nwhere we can take a vaccine \nthat works but is too expensive\n\n00:08:35.263 --> 00:08:36.922\nand can get protection\n\n00:08:36.922 --> 00:08:39.746\nwith a hundredth of the dose \ncompared to the needle.\n\n00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:43.797\nThat can take a vaccine that's suddenly \n10 dollars down to 10 cents,\n\n00:08:43.797 --> 00:08:46.977\nand that's particularly important \nwithin the developing world.\n\n00:08:46.977 --> 00:08:48.844\nBut there's another angle to this as well --\n\n00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:51.896\nyou can take vaccines that currently don't work\n\n00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:53.092\nand get them over that line\n\n00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:55.050\nand get them protective.\n\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.278\nAnd certainly in the world of vaccines\n\n00:08:57.278 --> 00:08:58.498\nthat can be important.\n\n00:08:58.498 --> 00:08:59.996\nLet's consider the big three:\n\n00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:02.693\nHIV, malaria, tuberculosis.\n\n00:09:02.693 --> 00:09:05.285\nThey're responsible for about \n7 million deaths per year,\n\n00:09:05.285 --> 00:09:08.492\nand there is no adequate vaccination \nmethod for any of those.\n\n00:09:08.492 --> 00:09:11.024\nSo potentially, with this new lever \nthat we have with the Nanopatch,\n\n00:09:11.024 --> 00:09:12.859\nwe can help make that happen.\n\n00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:17.729\nWe can push that lever to help get those \ncandidate vaccines over the line.\n\n00:09:17.729 --> 00:09:19.547\nNow, of course, we've worked within my lab\n\n00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:21.337\nwith many other vaccines that have attained\n\n00:09:21.337 --> 00:09:24.155\nsimilar responses and similar curves to this,\n\n00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:27.920\nwhat we've achieved with influenza.\n\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.079\nI'd like to now switch to talk about\n\n00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:33.411\nanother key shortcoming of today's vaccines,\n\n00:09:33.411 --> 00:09:36.831\nand that is the need to maintain the cold chain.\n\n00:09:36.831 --> 00:09:39.505\nAs the name suggests -- the cold chain --\n\n00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:42.445\nit's the requirements of keeping \na vaccine right from production\n\n00:09:42.445 --> 00:09:45.121\nall the way through to when the vaccine is applied,\n\n00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:48.219\nto keep it refrigerated.\n\n00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:51.465\nNow, that presents some logistical challenges\n\n00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.455\nbut we have ways to do it.\n\n00:09:54.455 --> 00:09:58.991\nThis is a slightly extreme case in point\n\n00:09:58.991 --> 00:10:01.474\nbut it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,\n\n00:10:01.474 --> 00:10:03.864\nin particular in resource-poor settings,\n\n00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:07.150\nof what's required to get vaccines\n\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.868\nrefrigerated and maintain the cold chain.\n\n00:10:08.868 --> 00:10:12.682\nIf the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,\n\n00:10:12.682 --> 00:10:14.889\nbut interestingly it can be too cold\n\n00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:17.450\nand the vaccine can break down as well.\n\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.832\nNow, the stakes are very high.\n\n00:10:20.832 --> 00:10:23.367\nThe WHO estimates that within Africa,\n\n00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:26.018\nup to half the vaccines used there\n\n00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:27.871\nare considered to not be working properly\n\n00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:30.861\nbecause at some point the \ncold chain has fallen over.\n\n00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:33.427\nSo it's a big problem, and it's tied \nin with the needle and syringe\n\n00:10:33.427 --> 00:10:38.660\nbecause it's a liquid form vaccine, and \nwhen it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.\n\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.171\nA key attribute of our Nanopatch\n\n00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:43.144\nis that the vaccine is dry,\n\n00:10:43.144 --> 00:10:45.933\nand when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.\n\n00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:48.345\nWithin my lab we've shown that we can keep\n\n00:10:48.345 --> 00:10:51.025\nthe vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius\n\n00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:54.741\nfor more than a year without \nany loss in activity at all.\n\n00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:57.128\nThat's an important improvement.\n\n00:10:57.128 --> 00:11:03.728\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:03.728 --> 00:11:06.191\nWe're delighted about it as well.\n\n00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:10.487\nAnd the thing about it is that\nwe have well and truly proven\n\n00:11:10.487 --> 00:11:13.150\nthe Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.\n\n00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.123\nAnd as a scientist, I love that and I love science.\n\n00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:19.631\nHowever, as an engineer,\n\n00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:21.344\nas a biomedical engineer\n\n00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:23.547\nand also as a human being,\n\n00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:24.778\nI'm not going to be satisfied\n\n00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:27.471\nuntil we've rolled this thing \nout, taken it out of the lab\n\n00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:29.902\nand got it to people in large numbers\n\n00:11:29.902 --> 00:11:33.438\nand particularly the people that need it the most.\n\n00:11:33.438 --> 00:11:36.140\nSo we've commenced this particular journey,\n\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.801\nand we've commenced this \njourney in an unusual way.\n\n00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:41.790\nWe've started with Papua New Guinea.\n\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:47.595\nNow, Papua New Guinea is an example \nof a developing world country.\n\n00:11:47.595 --> 00:11:50.731\nIt's about the same size as France,\n\n00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:53.566\nbut it suffers from many of the key barriers\n\n00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:57.634\nexisting within the world of today's vaccines.\n\n00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.247\nThere's the logistics:\n\n00:11:59.247 --> 00:12:03.605\nWithin this country there are only 800 \nrefrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.\n\n00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:07.898\nMany of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby,\nmany of them are breaking down\n\n00:12:07.898 --> 00:12:10.814\nand many are not in the Highlands \nwhere they are required.\n\n00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.277\nThat's a challenge.\n\n00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:17.460\nBut also, Papua New Guinea has the \nworld's highest incidence of HPV,\n\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.691\nhuman papillomavirus, the \ncervical cancer [risk factor].\n\n00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:24.392\nYet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers\n\n00:12:24.392 --> 00:12:26.306\nbecause it's too expensive.\n\n00:12:26.306 --> 00:12:29.052\nSo for those two reasons, with \nthe attributes of the Nanopatch,\n\n00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:31.667\nwe've got into the field and \nworked with the Nanopatch,\n\n00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:34.118\nand taken it to Papua New Guinea\n\n00:12:34.118 --> 00:12:38.101\nand we'll be following that up shortly.\n\n00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:41.583\nNow, doing this kind of work is not easy.\n\n00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:42.931\nIt's challenging,\n\n00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:46.255\nbut there's nothing else in \nthe world I'd rather be doing.\n\n00:12:46.255 --> 00:12:48.278\nAnd as we look ahead\n\n00:12:48.278 --> 00:12:52.020\nI'd like to share with you a thought:\n\n00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.028\nIt's the thought of a future where\n\n00:12:56.028 --> 00:12:57.961\nthe 17 million deaths per year\n\n00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:00.305\nthat we currently have due to infectious disease\n\n00:13:00.305 --> 00:13:02.939\nis a historical footnote.\n\n00:13:02.939 --> 00:13:05.035\nAnd it's a historical footnote that has been achieved\n\n00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:08.503\nby improved, radically improved vaccines.\n\n00:13:08.503 --> 00:13:10.786\nNow standing here today in front of you\n\n00:13:10.786 --> 00:13:12.459\nat the birthplace of the needle and syringe,\n\n00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.256\na device that's 160 years old,\n\n00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:17.592\nI'm presenting to you an alternative approach\n\n00:13:17.592 --> 00:13:19.841\nthat could really help make that happen --\n\n00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.823\nand it's the Nanopatch with its attributes \nof being needle-free, pain-free,\n\n00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:28.254\nthe ability for removing the cold chain\nand improving the immunogenicity.\n\n00:13:28.254 --> 00:13:30.207\nThank you.\n\n00:13:30.207 --> 00:13:33.375\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "So we leaned in ... now what?", "duration": "1016", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_so_we_leaned_in_now_what", "transcript": "Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.Sheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out and see so many women. It's so not my regular experience,  as I know anyone else's.PM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media, which we assumed it would be, but  that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions, particularly  in the sector of technology and social media. But how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave?SS: So I was really scared to get on  this stage and talk about women, because I grew up in the business  world, as I think so many of us did. You never talk about being a woman, because  someone might notice that you're a woman, right? They might notice. Or worse, if you say \"woman,\"  people on the other end of the table think you're asking for special  treatment, or complaining. Or worse, about to sue them.  And so I went through \u2014 (Laughter) Right? I went through my entire business career, and never spoke about being a woman,  never spoke about it publicly. But I also had noticed that it wasn't working.I came out of college over  20 years ago, and I thought that all of my peers were men and women,  all the people above me were all men, but that would change, because your generation had done such  an amazing job fighting for equality, equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't. Because year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer, and now, often the only woman in a room. And I talked to a bunch of people about, should I give a speech at TEDWomen  about women, and they said, oh no, no. It will end your business career. You  cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman.  You'll never be taken seriously again.But fortunately, there were the few, the proud \u2014 like you \u2014 who told me I should give the speech, and I asked myself the question  Mark Zuckerberg might \u2014 the founder of Facebook and my boss \u2014 asks all of us, which is, what  would I do if I wasn't afraid? And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't  afraid is I would get on the TED stage, and talk about women, and leadership.  And I did, and survived. (Applause)PM: I would say, not only survived.  I'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl, when you and I were standing backstage  together, and you turned to me, and you told me a story. And I said \u2014 very last minute \u2014 you know,  you really should share that story.SS: Oh, yeah. PM: What was that story?SS: Well, it's an important part of the  journey. So I had \u2014 TEDWomen \u2014 the original one was in D.C. \u2014 so I live here,  so I had gotten on a plane the day before, and my daughter was three, she was  clinging to my leg: \"Mommy, don't go.\" And Pat's a friend, and so, not related  to the speech I was planning on giving, which was chock full of facts and  figures, and nothing personal, I told Pat the story. I said, well,  I'm having a hard day. Yesterday my daughter was clinging  to my leg, and \"Don't go.\"And you looked at me and said,  you have to tell that story. I said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding? I'm going to get on a stage and admit  my daughter was clinging to my leg? And you said yes, because if you want to talk  about getting more women into leadership roles, you have to be honest about how hard it is. And I did. And I think that's a really  important part of the journey.The same thing happened when I wrote my book.  I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter, I thought it was fabulous. It was  chock-full of data and figures, I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai  tribes, and their sociological patterns. My husband read it and he was like, this  is like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter) No one \u2014 and I apologize to Wheaties if there's  someone \u2014 no one, no one will read this book. And I realized through the process that I  had to be more honest and more open, and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still  not feeling as self-confident as I should, in many situations. My first and  failed marriage. Crying at work. Felling like I didn't belong there,  feeling guilty to this day. And part of my journey, starting on this stage,  going to \"Lean In,\" going to the foundation, is all about being more open and  honest about those challenges, so that other women can be more open and honest, and all of us can work together towards real equality.PM: I think that one of the most  striking parts about the book, and in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such  a nerve and is resonating around the world, is that you are personal in the book,  and that you do make it clear that, while you've observed some things that are  very important for other women to know, that you've had the same challenges  that many others of us have, as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and  possibly the people who don't believe the same. So talk about that process: deciding  you'd go public with the private part, and then you would also put yourself in  the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges.SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was \u2014 you know, I never really expected to write  a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer, and it was viewed a lot, and it really  started impacting people's lives. I got this great \u2014- one of the first  letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big  promotion at work, and she turned it down, and she told her best friend she turned  it down, and her best friend said, you really need to watch this TED Talk. And so she watched this TED Talk, and she  went back the next day, she took the job, she went home, and she handed her  husband the grocery list. (Laughter) And she said, I can do this.And what really mattered to me \u2014 it wasn't  only women in the corporate world, even though I did hear from a lot of  them, and it did impact a lot of them, it was also people of all different circumstances. There was a doctor I met who was an  attending physician at Johns Hopkins, and he said that until he saw my TED  Talk, it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in  his med school classes were women, they weren't speaking as much as  the men as he did his rounds. So he started paying attention, and as he waited for  raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up. So he started encouraging the  women to raise their hands more, and it still didn't work. So he told everyone, no more  hand raising, I'm cold-calling. So he could call evenly on men and women.  And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better, and he was able to go back  to them and tell them that. And then there was the woman, stay-at-home  mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood, with not a great school, she said that TED  Talk \u2014 she's never had a corporate job, but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school  and fight for a better teacher for her child. And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice. And I realized that other women and  men could find their voice through it, which is why I went from the talk to the book.PM: And in the book, you not only found your  voice, which is clear and strong in the book, but you also share what you've learned \u2014 the experiences of other people in the lessons. And that's what I'm thinking about  in terms of putting yourself in a \u2014 you became a sort of expert in how you lean in. So what did that feel like, and  become like in your life? To launch not just a book, not just  a best-selling, best-viewed talk, but a movement, where people began to  literally describe their actions at work as, I'm leaning in.SS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored,  I'm happy, and it's the very beginning. So I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is  an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research. I have read every study, I have  pored over the materials, and the lessons are very clear.  Because here's what we know: What we know is that stereotypes are holding women  back from leadership roles all over the world. It's so striking. \"Lean In\" is very global,  I've been all over the world, talking about it, and \u2014 cultures are so different. Even within our own country, to Japan,  to Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe, they're so different. Except for one thing: gender. All over the world, no matter what our cultures are, we think men should be strong,  assertive, aggressive, have voice; we think women should speak  when spoken to, help others.Now we have, all over the world, women are called \"bossy.\"  There is a word for \"bossy,\" for little girls, in every language there's one. It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys, because if a little boy leads,  there's no negative word for it, it's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.Now I know there aren't a lot of  men here, but bear with me. If you're a man, you'll have  to represent your gender. Please raise your hand if you've been  told you're too aggressive at work. (Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about  five percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen. If you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've  ever been told you're too aggressive at work. (Laughter) That is what audiences have  said in every country in the world, and it's deeply supported by the data.Now, do we think women are more  aggressive than men? Of course not. It's just that we judge them through a different lens, and a lot of the character traits that you must  exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead, are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss, and in a woman, she's bossy. And the good news about this is that we  can change this by acknowledging it.One of the happiest moments  I had in this whole journey is, after the book came out, I stood on a stage  with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco. He read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he  invited me in front of his whole management team, men and women, and he said, I thought we  were good at this. I thought I was good at this. And then I read this book, and I  realized that we \u2014 my company \u2014 we have called all of our  senior women too aggressive, and I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry. And I want you to know we're  never going to do it again.PM: Can we send that to a lot of other  people that we know? (Applause)SS: And so John is doing that because  he believes it's good for his company, and so this kind of acknowledgement  of these biases can change it. And so next time you all see  someone call a little girl \"bossy,\" you walk right up to that person,  big smile, and you say, \"That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has  executive leadership skills.\" (Laughter)PM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter.  SS: Absolutely.PM: And you did focus in the book \u2014 and  the reason, as you said, in writing it, was to create a dialogue about this. I mean, let's just put it out there,  face the fact that women are \u2014 in a time when we have more open  doors, and more opportunities \u2014 are still not getting to the leadership positions. So in the months that have come since the book, in which \"Lean In\" focused on that and said, here are some of the challenges that remain, and  many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves. What has changed? Have you seen changes?SS: Well, there's certainly more  dialogue, which is great. But what really matters to me,  and I think all of us, is action. So everywhere I go, CEOs,  they're mostly men, say to me, you're costing me so much money because all the women want to  be paid as much as the men. And to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter) At all. I mean, the women should  be paid as much as the men.Everywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises. Everywhere I go, women say they're getting  better relationships with their spouses, asking for more help at home, asking for the  promotions they should be getting at work, and importantly, believing it  themselves. Even little things. One of the governors of one of the states told me  that he didn't realize that more women were, in fact, literally sitting on the side  of the room, which they are, and now he made a rule that all the women  on his staff need to sit at the table.The foundation I started along  with the book \"Lean In\" helps women, or men, start circles \u2014 small groups, it can be 10, it can be however many  you want, which meet once a month. I would have hoped that by now, we'd have  about 500 circles. That would've been great. You know, 500 times roughly 10. There are over 12,000 circles  in 50 countries in the world.PM: Wow, that's amazing.SS: And these are people who  are meeting every single month. I met one of them, I was in Beijing. A group of women, they're all about 29 or 30,  they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing, several of them grew up in very poor, rural China. These women are 29, they are told by  their society that they are \"left over,\" because they are not yet married, and the process of coming together  once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves. What they want in their careers. The  kind of partners they want, if at all. I looked at them, we went around  and introduced ourselves, and they all said their names  and where they're from, and I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg,  and this was my dream. And I kind of just started crying. Right, which, I admit, I do. Right?  I've talked about it before. But the fact that a woman so far away out in  the world, who grew up in a rural village, who's being told to marry someone  she doesn't want to marry, can now go meet once a month with  a group of people and refuse that, and find life on her own terms. That's the kind of change we have to hope for.PM: Have you been surprised by  the global nature of the message? Because I think when the book first  came out, many people thought, well, this is a really important handbook  for young women on their way up. They need to look at this, anticipate  the barriers, and recognize them, put them out in the open, have the dialogue about it, but that it's really for women who are that.  Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world. And yet the book is being read, as you  say, in rural and developing countries. What part of that has surprised you, and  perhaps led to a new perspective on your part?SS: The book is about self-confidence,  and about equality. And it turns out, everywhere in the world,  women need more self-confidence, because the world tells us we're not equal to men. Everywhere in the world, we live in  a world where the men get \"and,\" and women get \"or.\" I've never met a man who's been  asked how he does it all. (Laughter)Again, I'm going to turn to the men in the audience: Please raise your hand if you've  been asked, how do you do it all? (Laughter) Men only. Women, women. Please raise your hand  if you've been asked how you do it all? We assume men can do it all,  slash \u2014 have jobs and children. We assume women can't, and that's ridiculous, because the great majority of women everywhere  in the world, including the United States, work full time and have children.And I think people don't fully understand  how broad the message is. There is a circle that's been started  for rescued sex workers in Miami. They're using \"Lean In\" to help  people make the transition back to what would be a fair life, really rescuing  them from their pimps, and using it. There are dress-for-success groups  in Texas which are using the book, for women who have never been to college. And we know there are groups  all the way to Ethiopia. And so these messages of equality \u2014 of how women  are told they can't have what men can have \u2014 how we assume that leadership is for men,  how we assume that voice is for men, these affect all of us, and I  think they are very universal. And it's part of what TEDWomen does. It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in, which is more women, more voice, more equality.PM: If you were invited now to  make another TEDWomen talk, what would you say that is a result  of this experience, for you personally, and what you've learned about women, and men, as you've made this journey?SS: I think I would say \u2014 I tried to say this strongly, but I think I can say it more strongly \u2014 I want to say that the status quo is not enough. That it's not good enough, that it's  not changing quickly enough. Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book,  another year of data came out from the U.S. Census. And you know what we found? No movement in the wage gap  for women in the United States. Seventy-seven cents to the dollar. If you are a black woman, 64 cents. If you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents. Do you know when the last  time those numbers went up? 2002. We are stagnating, we are  stagnating in so many ways. And I think we are not really being honest about that, for so many reasons. It's so  hard to talk about gender. We shy away from the word \"feminist,\"  a word I really think we need to embrace. We have to get rid of the  word bossy and bring back \u2014 (Applause) I think I would say in a louder voice,  we need to get rid of the word \"bossy\" and bring back the word \"feminist,\"  because we need it. (Applause)PM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in.SS: A lot more leaning in.PM: Thank you, Sheryl. Thanks for leaning in and saying yes.SS: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1906, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:15.229\nPat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.\n\n00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.172\nSheryl Sandberg: First time back.

It's always so nice to look out\n\n00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:20.090\nand see so many women.\n\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.220\nIt's so not my regular experience, \nas I know anyone else's.\n\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.612\nPM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,\n\n00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:35.268\nwhich we assumed it would be, but \nthat you had very much on your mind\n\n00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:42.422\nthe missing leadership positions, particularly \nin the sector of technology and social media.\n\n00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:49.196\nBut how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave?\n\n00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:51.767\nSS: So I was really scared to get on \nthis stage and talk about women,\n\n00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.419\nbecause I grew up in the business \nworld, as I think so many of us did.\n\n00:00:55.419 --> 00:01:01.751\nYou never talk about being a woman, because \nsomeone might notice that you're a woman, right?\n\n00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:05.911\nThey might notice. Or worse, if you say \"woman,\" \npeople on the other end of the table\n\n00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.001\nthink you're asking for special \ntreatment, or complaining.\n\n00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.709\nOr worse, about to sue them. \nAnd so I went through -- (Laughter)\n\n00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:14.887\nRight? I went through my entire business career,\n\n00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.515\nand never spoke about being a woman, \nnever spoke about it publicly.\n\n00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.418\nBut I also had noticed that it wasn't working.\n\n00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:24.857\nI came out of college over \n20 years ago, and I thought\n\n00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:28.756\nthat all of my peers were men and women, \nall the people above me were all men,\n\n00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:29.854\nbut that would change,\n\n00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:34.387\nbecause your generation had done such \nan amazing job fighting for equality,\n\n00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:37.999\nequality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't.\n\n00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.334\nBecause year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,\n\n00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.286\nand now, often the only woman in a room.\n\n00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:45.376\nAnd I talked to a bunch of people about,\n\n00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.797\nshould I give a speech at TEDWomen \nabout women, and they said, oh no, no.\n\n00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:53.991\nIt will end your business career. You \ncannot be a serious business executive\n\n00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:57.429\nand speak about being a woman. \nYou'll never be taken seriously again.\n\n00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.304\nBut fortunately, there were the few, the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech,\n\n00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:04.960\nand I asked myself the question \nMark Zuckerberg might --\n\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.798\nthe founder of Facebook and my boss --\n\n00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:11.377\nasks all of us, which is, what \nwould I do if I wasn't afraid?\n\n00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:15.185\nAnd the answer to what would I do if I wasn't \nafraid is I would get on the TED stage,\n\n00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:22.704\nand talk about women, and leadership. \nAnd I did, and survived. (Applause)\n\n00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:26.539\nPM: I would say, not only survived. \nI'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl,\n\n00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.872\nwhen you and I were standing backstage \ntogether, and you turned to me,\n\n00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:32.610\nand you told me a story.\n\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.489\nAnd I said -- very last minute -- you know, \nyou really should share that story.\n\n00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.239\nSS: Oh, yeah.\nPM: What was that story?\n\n00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.504\nSS: Well, it's an important part of the \njourney. So I had -- TEDWomen --\n\n00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:45.313\nthe original one was in D.C. -- so I live here, \nso I had gotten on a plane the day before,\n\n00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:50.362\nand my daughter was three, she was \nclinging to my leg: \"Mommy, don't go.\"\n\n00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:54.095\nAnd Pat's a friend, and so, not related \nto the speech I was planning on giving,\n\n00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:58.557\nwhich was chock full of facts and \nfigures, and nothing personal,\n\n00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:00.823\nI told Pat the story. I said, well, \nI'm having a hard day.\n\n00:03:00.823 --> 00:03:03.427\nYesterday my daughter was clinging \nto my leg, and \"Don't go.\"\n\n00:03:03.427 --> 00:03:05.171\nAnd you looked at me and said, \nyou have to tell that story.\n\n00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:09.406\nI said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?\n\n00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:11.863\nI'm going to get on a stage and admit \nmy daughter was clinging to my leg?\n\n00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:16.030\nAnd you said yes, because if you want to talk \nabout getting more women into leadership roles,\n\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.167\nyou have to be honest about how hard it is.\n\n00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:23.903\nAnd I did. And I think that's a really \nimportant part of the journey.\n\n00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:29.201\nThe same thing happened when I wrote my book. \nI started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,\n\n00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:33.167\nI thought it was fabulous. It was \nchock-full of data and figures,\n\n00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:41.027\nI had three pages on matrilineal Maasai \ntribes, and their sociological patterns.\n\n00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:46.090\nMy husband read it and he was like, this \nis like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.455\nNo one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there's \nsomeone -- no one, no one will read this book.\n\n00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:57.640\nAnd I realized through the process that I \nhad to be more honest and more open,\n\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.386\nand I had to tell my stories. My stories of still \nnot feeling as self-confident as I should,\n\n00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:08.605\nin many situations. My first and \nfailed marriage. Crying at work.\n\n00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:12.277\nFelling like I didn't belong there, \nfeeling guilty to this day.\n\n00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:16.672\nAnd part of my journey, starting on this stage, \ngoing to \"Lean In,\" going to the foundation,\n\n00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:20.560\nis all about being more open and \nhonest about those challenges,\n\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.568\nso that other women can be more open and honest,\n\n00:04:22.568 --> 00:04:26.200\nand all of us can work together towards real equality.\n\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.542\nPM: I think that one of the most \nstriking parts about the book,\n\n00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:35.407\nand in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such \na nerve and is resonating around the world,\n\n00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:41.192\nis that you are personal in the book, \nand that you do make it clear that,\n\n00:04:41.192 --> 00:04:45.350\nwhile you've observed some things that are \nvery important for other women to know,\n\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.909\nthat you've had the same challenges \nthat many others of us have,\n\n00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:56.704\nas you faced the hurdles and the barriers and \npossibly the people who don't believe the same.\n\n00:04:56.704 --> 00:05:01.342\nSo talk about that process: deciding \nyou'd go public with the private part,\n\n00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:05.059\nand then you would also put yourself in \nthe position of something of an expert\n\n00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.500\non how to resolve those challenges.\n\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.684\nSS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was --\n\n00:05:10.684 --> 00:05:14.432\nyou know, I never really expected to write \na book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer,\n\n00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:19.101\nand it was viewed a lot, and it really \nstarted impacting people's lives.\n\n00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:22.621\nI got this great --- one of the first \nletters I got was from a woman\n\n00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:27.747\nwho said that she was offered a really big \npromotion at work, and she turned it down,\n\n00:05:27.747 --> 00:05:30.100\nand she told her best friend she turned \nit down, and her best friend said,\n\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.933\nyou really need to watch this TED Talk.\n\n00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:36.349\nAnd so she watched this TED Talk, and she \nwent back the next day, she took the job,\n\n00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.197\nshe went home, and she handed her \nhusband the grocery list. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:42.789\nAnd she said, I can do this.\n\n00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.942\nAnd what really mattered to me -- it wasn't \nonly women in the corporate world,\n\n00:05:45.942 --> 00:05:48.912\neven though I did hear from a lot of \nthem, and it did impact a lot of them,\n\n00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:52.742\nit was also people of all different circumstances.\n\n00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:56.489\nThere was a doctor I met who was an \nattending physician at Johns Hopkins,\n\n00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:00.082\nand he said that until he saw my TED \nTalk, it never really occurred to him\n\n00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:02.456\nthat even though half the students in \nhis med school classes were women,\n\n00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:05.367\nthey weren't speaking as much as \nthe men as he did his rounds.\n\n00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:11.593\nSo he started paying attention, and as he waited for \nraised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.\n\n00:06:11.593 --> 00:06:13.878\nSo he started encouraging the \nwomen to raise their hands more,\n\n00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:15.155\nand it still didn't work.\n\n00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.709\nSo he told everyone, no more \nhand raising, I'm cold-calling.\n\n00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:22.913\nSo he could call evenly on men and women. \nAnd what he proved to himself was that\n\n00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:25.546\nthe women knew the answers just as well or better,\n\n00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:27.434\nand he was able to go back \nto them and tell them that.\n\n00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:32.553\nAnd then there was the woman, stay-at-home \nmom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,\n\n00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:36.589\nwith not a great school, she said that TED \nTalk -- she's never had a corporate job,\n\n00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:42.364\nbut that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school \nand fight for a better teacher for her child.\n\n00:06:42.364 --> 00:06:46.656\nAnd I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.\n\n00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:50.710\nAnd I realized that other women and \nmen could find their voice through it,\n\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.432\nwhich is why I went from the talk to the book.\n\n00:06:53.432 --> 00:06:59.757\nPM: And in the book, you not only found your \nvoice, which is clear and strong in the book,\n\n00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:03.321\nbut you also share what you've learned --\n\n00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:06.464\nthe experiences of other people in the lessons.\n\n00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:10.646\nAnd that's what I'm thinking about \nin terms of putting yourself in a --\n\n00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:15.600\nyou became a sort of expert in how you lean in.\n\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.992\nSo what did that feel like, and \nbecome like in your life?\n\n\n00:07:19.992 --> 00:07:26.204\nTo launch not just a book, not just \na best-selling, best-viewed talk,\n\n00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:32.048\nbut a movement, where people began to \nliterally describe their actions at work as,\n\n00:07:32.048 --> 00:07:34.730\nI'm leaning in.\n\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:41.944\nSS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored, \nI'm happy, and it's the very beginning.\n\n00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:46.458\nSo I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is \nan expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.\n\n00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:49.671\nI have read every study, I have \npored over the materials,\n\n00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:53.299\nand the lessons are very clear. \nBecause here's what we know:\n\n00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:58.011\nWhat we know is that stereotypes are holding women \nback from leadership roles all over the world.\n\n00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.614\nIt's so striking. \"Lean In\" is very global, \nI've been all over the world,\n\n00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:03.009\ntalking about it, and -- cultures are so different.\n\n00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:08.002\nEven within our own country, to Japan, \nto Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,\n\n00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:12.189\nthey're so different. Except for one thing: gender.\n\n00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:14.109\nAll over the world, no matter what our cultures are,\n\n00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:18.439\nwe think men should be strong, \nassertive, aggressive, have voice;\n\n00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:22.956\nwe think women should speak \nwhen spoken to, help others.\n\n00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:26.661\nNow we have, all over the world,\n\n00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:30.454\nwomen are called \"bossy.\" \nThere is a word for \"bossy,\"\n\n00:08:30.454 --> 00:08:32.772\nfor little girls, in every language there's one.\n\n00:08:32.772 --> 00:08:34.982\nIt's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys,\n\n00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:37.910\nbecause if a little boy leads, \nthere's no negative word for it,\n\n00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.699\nit's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.\n\n00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.694\nNow I know there aren't a lot of \nmen here, but bear with me.\n\n00:08:44.694 --> 00:08:47.228\nIf you're a man, you'll have \nto represent your gender.\n\n00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:52.792\nPlease raise your hand if you've been \ntold you're too aggressive at work.\n\n00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:58.676\n(Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about \nfive percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen.\n\n00:08:58.676 --> 00:09:05.239\nIf you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've \never been told you're too aggressive at work.\n\n00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:08.852\n(Laughter) That is what audiences have \nsaid in every country in the world,\n\n00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:11.718\nand it's deeply supported by the data.\n\n00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:16.057\nNow, do we think women are more \naggressive than men? Of course not.\n\n00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:18.407\nIt's just that we judge them through a different lens,\n\n00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:23.258\nand a lot of the character traits that you must \nexhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead,\n\n00:09:23.258 --> 00:09:26.122\nare ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss,\n\n00:09:26.122 --> 00:09:27.744\nand in a woman, she's bossy.\n\n00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:31.830\nAnd the good news about this is that we \ncan change this by acknowledging it.\n\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.220\nOne of the happiest moments \nI had in this whole journey is,\n\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.153\nafter the book came out, I stood on a stage \nwith John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.\n\n00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:42.812\nHe read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he \ninvited me in front of his whole management team,\n\n00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:46.204\nmen and women, and he said, I thought we \nwere good at this. I thought I was good at this.\n\n00:09:46.204 --> 00:09:51.270\nAnd then I read this book, and I \nrealized that we -- my company --\n\n00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.254\nwe have called all of our \nsenior women too aggressive,\n\n00:09:53.254 --> 00:09:55.703\nand I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry.\n\n00:09:55.703 --> 00:09:59.448\nAnd I want you to know we're \nnever going to do it again.\n\n00:09:59.448 --> 00:10:02.832\nPM: Can we send that to a lot of other \npeople that we know? (Applause)\n\n00:10:02.832 --> 00:10:06.733\nSS: And so John is doing that because \nhe believes it's good for his company,\n\n00:10:06.733 --> 00:10:09.771\nand so this kind of acknowledgement \nof these biases can change it.\n\n00:10:09.787 --> 00:10:13.435\nAnd so next time you all see \nsomeone call a little girl \"bossy,\"\n\n00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:15.983\nyou walk right up to that person, \nbig smile, and you say,\n\n00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:22.518\n\"That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has \nexecutive leadership skills.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:10:22.518 --> 00:10:25.723\nPM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter. \nSS: Absolutely.\n\n00:10:25.723 --> 00:10:28.792\nPM: And you did focus in the book -- and \nthe reason, as you said, in writing it,\n\n00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:30.717\nwas to create a dialogue about this.\n\n00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:34.231\nI mean, let's just put it out there, \nface the fact that women are --\n\n00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:37.906\nin a time when we have more open \ndoors, and more opportunities --\n\n00:10:37.906 --> 00:10:41.206\nare still not getting to the leadership positions.\n\n00:10:41.206 --> 00:10:43.404\nSo in the months that have come since the book,\n\n00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:45.962\nin which \"Lean In\" focused on that and said,\n\n00:10:45.962 --> 00:10:50.262\nhere are some of the challenges that remain, and \nmany of them we have to own within ourselves\n\n00:10:50.262 --> 00:10:53.024\nand look at ourselves. What has changed?\n\n00:10:53.024 --> 00:10:55.110\nHave you seen changes?\n\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.373\nSS: Well, there's certainly more \ndialogue, which is great.\n\n00:10:57.373 --> 00:11:00.421\nBut what really matters to me, \nand I think all of us, is action.\n\n00:11:00.421 --> 00:11:04.205\nSo everywhere I go, CEOs, \nthey're mostly men, say to me,\n\n00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.824\nyou're costing me so much money\n\n00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:09.996\nbecause all the women want to \nbe paid as much as the men.\n\n00:11:09.996 --> 00:11:14.277\nAnd to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:17.515\nAt all. I mean, the women should \nbe paid as much as the men.\n\n00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:20.652\nEverywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.\n\n00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:24.649\nEverywhere I go, women say they're getting \nbetter relationships with their spouses,\n\n00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:28.629\nasking for more help at home, asking for the \npromotions they should be getting at work,\n\n00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:31.627\nand importantly, believing it \nthemselves. Even little things.\n\n00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:35.659\nOne of the governors of one of the states told me \nthat he didn't realize that more women were, in fact,\n\n00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:37.888\nliterally sitting on the side \nof the room, which they are,\n\n00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:43.375\nand now he made a rule that all the women \non his staff need to sit at the table.\n\n00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:45.531\nThe foundation I started along \nwith the book \"Lean In\"\n\n00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:48.883\nhelps women, or men, start circles -- small groups,\n\n00:11:48.883 --> 00:11:52.132\nit can be 10, it can be however many \nyou want, which meet once a month.\n\n00:11:52.132 --> 00:11:55.453\nI would have hoped that by now, we'd have \nabout 500 circles. That would've been great.\n\n00:11:55.453 --> 00:11:58.375\nYou know, 500 times roughly 10.\n\n00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:01.605\nThere are over 12,000 circles \nin 50 countries in the world.\n\n00:12:01.605 --> 00:12:03.165\nPM: Wow, that's amazing.\n\n00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:06.240\nSS: And these are people who \nare meeting every single month.\n\n00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.579\nI met one of them, I was in Beijing.\n\n00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:13.279\nA group of women, they're all about 29 or 30, \nthey started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,\n\n00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:17.272\nseveral of them grew up in very poor, rural China.\n\n00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:23.080\nThese women are 29, they are told by \ntheir society that they are \"left over,\"\n\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.093\nbecause they are not yet married,\n\n00:12:25.093 --> 00:12:27.876\nand the process of coming together \nonce a month at a meeting\n\n00:12:27.876 --> 00:12:31.176\nis helping them define who they are for themselves.\n\n00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:35.512\nWhat they want in their careers. The \nkind of partners they want, if at all.\n\n00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:37.499\nI looked at them, we went around \nand introduced ourselves,\n\n00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:39.338\nand they all said their names \nand where they're from,\n\n00:12:39.338 --> 00:12:42.818\nand I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg, \nand this was my dream.\n\n00:12:42.818 --> 00:12:44.658\nAnd I kind of just started crying.\n\n00:12:44.658 --> 00:12:49.415\nRight, which, I admit, I do.

Two years ago, I knew exactly  what an icon looked like. It looks like this. Everybody's icon, but also the default position of a curator of Italian Renaissance  paintings, which I was then. And in a way, this is also another default selection. Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image of the \"Lady with an Ermine.\" And I use that word, soulful, deliberately. Or then there's this, or rather these: the two versions of Leonardo's \"Virgin of the Rocks\" that were about to come together  in London for the very first time. In the exhibition that I was then in  the absolute throes of organizing. I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo, and I had been for three years. So, he was occupying every part of my brain. Leonardo had taught me, during that three years, about what a picture can do. About taking you from your own  material world into a spiritual world. He said, actually, that he believed  the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible  and invisible in the universe. That's a huge task. And yet,  somehow he achieves it. He shows us, I think, the human soul. He shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm. To see a vision of the universe that's  more perfect than our own. To see God's own plan, in some sense. So this, in a sense, was really  what I believed an icon was.At about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,director here of the Metropolitan Museum, about what my next move might be. The move, in fact, back to an earlier life, one I'd begun at the British Museum, back to the world of three dimensions \u2014 of sculpture and of decorative arts \u2014 to take over the department of European sculpture  and decorative arts, here at the Met. But it was an incredibly busy time. All the conversations were done  at very peculiar times of the day \u2014 over the phone. In the end, I accepted the job without actually having been here. Again, I'd been there a couple of years before, but on that particular visit. So, it was just before the time that  the Leonardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Met, to New York, to see my new domain. To see what European sculpture  and decorative arts looked like, beyond those Renaissance collections  with which I was so already familiar. And I thought, on that very first day,  I better tour the galleries. Fifty-seven of these galleries \u2014 like 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe. I walked through and I started in my comfort zone in the Italian Renaissance. And then I moved gradually around, feeling a little lost sometimes. My head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition that was about to open, and I came across this. And I thought to myself: What the hell have I done? There was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on, it was a kind of repulsion. This object felt utterly and completely alien. Silly at a level that I hadn't yet  understood silliness to be. And then it was made worse \u2014 there were two of them. (Laughter) So, I started thinking about why it was, in fact, that I disliked this object so much. What was the anatomy of my distaste? Well, so much gold, so vulgar. You know, so nouveau riche, frankly. Leonardo himself had preached  against the use of gold, so it was absolutely anathema at that moment. And then there's little pretty sprigs  of flowers everywhere. (Laughter) And finally, that pink. That damned pink. It's such an extraordinarily artificial color. I mean, it's a color that I can't think of  anything that you actually see in nature, that looks that shade. The object even has its own tutu. (Laughter) This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the vase. It reminded me, in an odd kind of way, of my niece's fifth birthday party. Where all the little girls would come  either as a princess or a fairy. There was one who would come as a fairy princess. You should have seen the looks. (Laughter) And I realize that this object was in my mind, born from the same mind, from the same womb, practically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter) And then there's the elephants. (Laughter) Those extraordinary elephants with their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions and Greta Garbo eyelashes, with  these golden tusks and so on. I realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic  march across the Serengeti. It was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)But something more profound  was happening as well. These objects, it seemed to me, were quintessentially the kind that I  and my liberal left friends in London had always seen as summing up something deplorable about the French aristocracy in the 18th century. The label had told me that these pieces were made by the S\u00e8vres Manufactory, made of porcelain in the late 1750s, and designed by a designer called  Jean-Claude Duplessis, actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned. But for me, they summed up a kind of, that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy in the 18th century. I and my colleagues had always thought that these objects, in way, summed up the idea of, you know \u2014 no wonder there was a revolution. Or, indeed, thank God there was a revolution. There was a sort of idea really, that, if you owned a vase like this, then there was really only one fate possible. (Laughter)So, there I was \u2014 in a sort of paroxysm of horror. But I took the job and I went  on looking at these vases. I sort of had to because they're  on a through route in the Met. So, almost anywhere I went, there they were. They had this kind of odd sort of fascination, like a car accident. Where I couldn't stop looking. And as I did so, I started thinking: Well, what are we actually looking at here? And what I started with was understanding this as really a supreme piece of design. It took me a little time. But, that tutu for example \u2014 actually, this is a piece that  does dance in its own way. It has an extraordinary lightness and yet, it is also amazing balanced. It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients. And then the play between \u2014 actually really quite carefully disposed  color and gilding, and the sculptural surface, is really rather remarkable. And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln four times, at least four times  in order to arrive at this. How many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece? And then remember, not just one, but two. So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this kind. And then this question of uselessness. Well actually, the end of the trunks  were originally candle holders. So what you would have had  were candles on either side. Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface. On the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold. It would have glittered in an interior, a little like a little firework.And at that point, actually,  a firework went off in my brain. Somebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' \u2014 which in a sense for me, encapsulated this object \u2014 actually comes from the same  root as the word 'fantasy.' And that what this object was just as much in a way, in its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting, is a portal to somewhere else. This is an object of the imagination. If you think about the mad 18th-century  operas of the time \u2014 set in the Orient. If you think about divans and perhaps even  opium-induced visions of pink elephants, then at that point, this object starts to make sense. This is an object which is all about escapism. It's about an escapism that happens \u2014 that the aristocracy in France sought very deliberately to distinguish themselves from ordinary people.It's not an escapism that we feel particularly happy with today, however. And again, going on thinking about this, I realize that in a way we're all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another, or are deemed to do so. And the extraneous ornament is seen as really, essentially, criminal. It's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones. And that seems fine. Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of  sequestration of imagination. So just as in the 20th century, so many people had the idea that their faith took place on the Sabbath day, and the rest of their lives \u2014 their lives of washing machines and orthodontics \u2014 took place on another day. Then, I think we've started doing the same. We've allowed ourselves to lead our fantasy lives in front of screens. In the dark of the cinema, with the television in the corner of the room. We've eliminated, in a sense, that constant of the imagination that these vases  represented in people's lives. So maybe it's time we got this back a little. I think it's beginning to happen. In London, for example, with these extraordinary buildings that have been appearing over the last few years. Redolent, in a sense, of science fiction, turning London into a kind of fantasy playground. It's actually amazing to look out of  a high building nowadays there. But even then, there's a resistance. London has called these buildings the  Gherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie \u2014 bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth. There's an idea that we don't want these anxious-making, imaginative journeys  to happen in our daily lives. I feel lucky in a way, I've encountered this object. (Laughter) I found him on the Internet when  I was looking up a reference. And there he was. And unlike the pink elephant vase, this was a kind of love at first sight. In fact, reader, I married him. I bought him. And he now adorns my office. He's a Staffordshire figure made  in the middle of the 19th century. He represents the actor, Edmund Kean,  playing Shakespeare's Richard III. And it's based, actually, on a more  elevated piece of porcelain. So I loved, on an art historical level, I loved that layered quality that he has. But more than that, I love him. In a way that I think would have been impossible without the pink S\u00e8vres vase in my Leonardo days. I love his orange and pink breeches. I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war, having just finished the washing up. (Laughter) He seems also to have forgotten his sword. I love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy. In a way, he's become my sort of alter ego. He's, I hope, a little bit dignified, but mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter) And energetic, I hope, too. I let him into my life because the S\u00e8vres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so. And before that Leonardo, I understood that this object could become  part of a journey for me every day, sitting in my office. I really hope that others, all of you, visiting objects in the museum, and taking them home and  finding them for yourselves, will allow those objects to flourish  in your imaginative lives. Thank you very much.

And yet, \nsomehow he achieves it.\n\n00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.854\nHe shows us, I think, the human soul.\n\n00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:32.300\nHe shows us the capacity of ourselves\n\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.728\nto move into a spiritual realm.\n\n00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:40.256\nTo see a vision of the universe that's \nmore perfect than our own.\n\n00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:43.832\nTo see God's own plan, in some sense.\n\n00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:47.903\nSo this, in a sense, was really \nwhat I believed an icon was.\n\n00:01:47.903 --> 00:01:51.761\nAt about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,\n\n00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.312\ndirector here of the Metropolitan Museum,\n\n00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:57.636\nabout what my next move might be.\n\n00:01:57.636 --> 00:02:00.407\nThe move, in fact, back to an earlier life,\n\n00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:02.365\none I'd begun at the British Museum,\n\n00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:04.884\nback to the world of three dimensions --\n\n00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:07.116\nof sculpture and of decorative arts --\n\n00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:11.334\nto take over the department of European sculpture \nand decorative arts, here at the Met.\n\n00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:12.774\nBut it was an incredibly busy time.\n\n00:02:12.774 --> 00:02:16.181\nAll the conversations were done \nat very peculiar times of the day --\n\n00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:19.094\nover the phone.\n\n00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.158\nIn the end, I accepted the job\n\n00:02:21.158 --> 00:02:22.531\nwithout actually having been here.\n\n00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.083\nAgain, I'd been there a couple of years before,\n\n00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:27.595\nbut on that particular visit.\n\n00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:31.687\nSo, it was just before the time that \nthe Leonardo show was due to open\n\n00:02:31.687 --> 00:02:35.709\nwhen I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,\n\n00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.165\nto see my new domain.\n\n00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:41.108\nTo see what European sculpture \nand decorative arts looked like,\n\n00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:45.899\nbeyond those Renaissance collections \nwith which I was so already familiar.\n\n00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.896\nAnd I thought, on that very first day, \nI better tour the galleries.\n\n00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:50.348\nFifty-seven of these galleries --\n\n00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:55.204\nlike 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.\n\n00:02:55.204 --> 00:03:01.325\nI walked through and I started in my comfort zone\nin the Italian Renaissance.\n\n00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:03.246\nAnd then I moved gradually around,\n\n00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:06.348\nfeeling a little lost sometimes.\n\n00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:09.401\nMy head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition\n\n00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.423\nthat was about to open, and I came across this.\n\n00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:21.353\nAnd I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?\n\n00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:24.706\nThere was absolutely no connection in my mind\n\n00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:27.805\nat all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,\n\n00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:30.174\nit was a kind of repulsion.\n\n00:03:30.174 --> 00:03:33.412\nThis object felt utterly and completely alien.\n\n00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:38.875\nSilly at a level that I hadn't yet \nunderstood silliness to be.\n\n00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:41.074\nAnd then it was made worse --\n\n00:03:41.074 --> 00:03:42.919\nthere were two of them.\n\n00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.058\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:49.025\nSo, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,\n\n00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:51.481\nthat I disliked this object so much.\n\n00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.287\nWhat was the anatomy of my distaste?\n\n00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:58.755\nWell, so much gold, so vulgar.\n\n00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:02.609\nYou know, so nouveau riche, frankly.\n\n00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.522\nLeonardo himself had preached \nagainst the use of gold,\n\n00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:08.957\nso it was absolutely anathema at that moment.\n\n00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:14.385\nAnd then there's little pretty sprigs \nof flowers everywhere. (Laughter)\n\n00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:17.904\nAnd finally, that pink. That damned pink.\n\n00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:20.800\nIt's such an extraordinarily artificial color.\n\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.328\nI mean, it's a color that I can't think of \nanything that you actually see in nature,\n\n00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:27.416\nthat looks that shade.\n\n00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:31.156\nThe object even has its own tutu. (Laughter)\n\n00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:33.516\nThis little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit\n\n00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:35.551\nthat sits at the bottom of the vase.\n\n00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:37.924\nIt reminded me, in an odd kind of way,\n\n00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:40.023\nof my niece's fifth birthday party.\n\n00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:44.545\nWhere all the little girls would come \neither as a princess or a fairy.\n\n00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:46.426\nThere was one who would come as a fairy princess.\n\n00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:48.848\nYou should have seen the looks.\n\n00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:50.541\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:53.883\nAnd I realize that this object was in my mind,\n\n00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:56.823\nborn from the same mind, from the same womb,\n\n00:04:56.823 --> 00:05:02.047\npractically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:02.047 --> 00:05:05.569\nAnd then there's the elephants. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.715\nThose extraordinary elephants\n\n00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:10.439\nwith their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions\n\n00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:15.736\nand Greta Garbo eyelashes, with \nthese golden tusks and so on.\n\n00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:17.512\nI realized this was an elephant that had\n\n00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:23.245\nabsolutely nothing to do with a majestic \nmarch across the Serengeti.\n\n00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:28.740\nIt was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.586\nBut something more profound \nwas happening as well.\n\n00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:33.015\nThese objects, it seemed to me,\n\n00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:37.324\nwere quintessentially the kind that I \nand my liberal left friends in London\n\n00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:39.859\nhad always seen as summing up\n\n00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:42.698\nsomething deplorable about the French aristocracy\n\n00:05:42.698 --> 00:05:44.870\nin the 18th century.\n\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.659\nThe label had told me that these pieces were made\n\n00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.370\nby the S\u00e8vres Manufactory,\n\n00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.595\nmade of porcelain in the late 1750s,\n\n00:05:53.595 --> 00:05:56.726\nand designed by a designer called \nJean-Claude Duplessis,\n\n00:05:56.726 --> 00:05:58.922\nactually somebody of extraordinary distinction\n\n00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:01.399\nas I later learned.\n\n00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:06.207\nBut for me, they summed up a kind of,\n\n00:06:06.207 --> 00:06:09.621\nthat sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy\n\n00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.094\nin the 18th century.\n\n00:06:13.094 --> 00:06:15.560\nI and my colleagues had always thought\n\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.516\nthat these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,\n\n00:06:18.516 --> 00:06:20.880\nyou know -- no wonder there was a revolution.\n\n00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.423\nOr, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.\n\n00:06:25.423 --> 00:06:27.182\nThere was a sort of idea really, that,\n\n00:06:27.182 --> 00:06:29.855\nif you owned a vase like this,\n\n00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:33.579\nthen there was really only one fate possible.\n\n00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:37.643\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:37.643 --> 00:06:42.307\nSo, there I was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror.\n\n00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:46.267\nBut I took the job and I went \non looking at these vases.\n\n00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:49.798\nI sort of had to because they're \non a through route in the Met.\n\n00:06:49.798 --> 00:06:52.430\nSo, almost anywhere I went, there they were.\n\n00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.199\nThey had this kind of odd sort of fascination,\n\n00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.217\nlike a car accident.\n\n00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:00.941\nWhere I couldn't stop looking.\n\n00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:03.163\nAnd as I did so, I started thinking:\n\n00:07:03.163 --> 00:07:07.691\nWell, what are we actually looking at here?\n\n00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:11.022\nAnd what I started with was understanding this\n\n00:07:11.022 --> 00:07:14.574\nas really a supreme piece of design.\n\n00:07:14.574 --> 00:07:15.671\nIt took me a little time.\n\n00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:17.109\nBut, that tutu for example --\n\n00:07:17.109 --> 00:07:20.231\nactually, this is a piece that \ndoes dance in its own way.\n\n00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.873\nIt has an extraordinary lightness\n\n00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:24.388\nand yet, it is also amazing balanced.\n\n00:07:24.388 --> 00:07:27.863\nIt has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.\n\n00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:29.502\nAnd then the play between --\n\n00:07:29.502 --> 00:07:34.114\nactually really quite carefully disposed \ncolor and gilding, and the sculptural surface,\n\n00:07:34.114 --> 00:07:36.389\nis really rather remarkable.\n\n00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.219\nAnd then I realized that this piece went into the kiln\n\n00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:42.609\nfour times, at least four times \nin order to arrive at this.\n\n00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:45.663\nHow many moments for accident can you think of\n\n00:07:45.663 --> 00:07:47.167\nthat could have happened to this piece?\n\n00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:49.729\nAnd then remember, not just one, but two.\n\n00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.994\nSo he's having to arrive at two exactly matched\n\n00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:56.506\nvases of this kind.\n\n00:07:56.506 --> 00:07:57.912\nAnd then this question of uselessness.\n\n00:07:57.912 --> 00:08:02.871\nWell actually, the end of the trunks \nwere originally candle holders.\n\n00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:06.621\nSo what you would have had \nwere candles on either side.\n\n00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:09.177\nImagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.\n\n00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:11.909\nOn the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.\n\n00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:14.655\nIt would have glittered in an interior,\n\n00:08:14.655 --> 00:08:17.737\na little like a little firework.\n\n00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:21.389\nAnd at that point, actually, \na firework went off in my brain.\n\n00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:24.224\nSomebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' --\n\n00:08:24.224 --> 00:08:27.334\nwhich in a sense for me, encapsulated this object --\n\n00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:31.380\nactually comes from the same \nroot as the word 'fantasy.'\n\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.996\nAnd that what this object was just as much in a way,\n\n00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:36.448\nin its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,\n\n00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:38.655\nis a portal to somewhere else.\n\n00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:42.850\nThis is an object of the imagination.\n\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:49.659\nIf you think about the mad 18th-century \noperas of the time -- set in the Orient.\n\n00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:56.158\nIf you think about divans and perhaps even \nopium-induced visions of pink elephants,\n\n00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:59.459\nthen at that point, this object starts to make sense.\n\n00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:03.515\nThis is an object which is all about escapism.\n\n00:09:03.515 --> 00:09:06.712\nIt's about an escapism that happens --\n\n00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.733\nthat the aristocracy in France sought\n\n00:09:08.733 --> 00:09:10.519\nvery deliberately\n\n00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:15.087\nto distinguish themselves from ordinary people.\n\n00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:17.051\nIt's not an escapism that\n\n00:09:17.051 --> 00:09:20.918\nwe feel particularly happy with today, however.\n\n00:09:20.918 --> 00:09:23.903\nAnd again, going on thinking about this,\n\n00:09:23.903 --> 00:09:27.077\nI realize that in a way we're all victims\n\n00:09:27.077 --> 00:09:29.088\nof a certain kind of tyranny\n\n00:09:29.088 --> 00:09:31.109\nof the triumph of modernism\n\n00:09:31.109 --> 00:09:33.835\nwhereby form and function in an object\n\n00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:37.240\nhave to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.\n\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.204\nAnd the extraneous ornament is seen as really,\n\n00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:43.224\nessentially, criminal.\n\n00:09:43.224 --> 00:09:46.375\nIt's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois\nvalues rather than aristocratic ones.\n\n00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:48.198\nAnd that seems fine.\n\n00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:55.655\nExcept for the fact that it becomes a kind of \nsequestration of imagination.\n\n00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:58.345\nSo just as in the 20th century, so many people\n\n00:09:58.345 --> 00:10:00.333\nhad the idea that their faith\n\n00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.015\ntook place on the Sabbath day,\n\n00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:04.389\nand the rest of their lives --\n\n00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:08.367\ntheir lives of washing machines and orthodontics --\n\n00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:10.399\ntook place on another day.\n\n00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:14.167\nThen, I think we've started doing the same.\n\n00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:17.499\nWe've allowed ourselves to\n\n00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:19.856\nlead our fantasy lives in front of screens.\n\n00:10:19.856 --> 00:10:23.838\nIn the dark of the cinema, with the\ntelevision in the corner of the room.\n\n00:10:23.838 --> 00:10:27.916\nWe've eliminated, in a sense, that constant\n\n00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:32.844\nof the imagination that these vases \nrepresented in people's lives.\n\n00:10:32.844 --> 00:10:36.880\nSo maybe it's time we got this back a little.\n\n00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.230\nI think it's beginning to happen.\n\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.496\nIn London, for example,\n\n00:10:40.496 --> 00:10:42.645\nwith these extraordinary buildings\n\n00:10:42.645 --> 00:10:45.636\nthat have been appearing over the last few years.\n\n00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:48.039\nRedolent, in a sense, of science fiction,\n\n00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:50.153\nturning London into a kind of fantasy playground.\n\n00:10:50.153 --> 00:10:55.007\nIt's actually amazing to look out of \na high building nowadays there.\n\n00:10:55.007 --> 00:10:56.811\nBut even then, there's a resistance.\n\n00:10:56.811 --> 00:11:01.147\nLondon has called these buildings the \nGherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie --\n\n00:11:01.147 --> 00:11:04.452\nbringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.\n\n00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:08.532\nThere's an idea that we don't want these\n\n00:11:08.532 --> 00:11:13.393\nanxious-making, imaginative journeys \nto happen in our daily lives.\n\n00:11:13.393 --> 00:11:16.661\nI feel lucky in a way,\n\n00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:19.209\nI've encountered this object.\n\n00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:21.650\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.952\nI found him on the Internet when \nI was looking up a reference.\n\n00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:27.846\nAnd there he was.\n\n00:11:27.846 --> 00:11:31.160\nAnd unlike the pink elephant vase,\n\n00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.133\nthis was a kind of love at first sight.\n\n00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:35.989\nIn fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.\n\n00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:39.853\nAnd he now adorns my office.\n\n00:11:39.853 --> 00:11:43.394\nHe's a Staffordshire figure made \nin the middle of the 19th century.\n\n00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:48.200\nHe represents the actor, Edmund Kean, \nplaying Shakespeare's Richard III.\n\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.653\nAnd it's based, actually, on a more \nelevated piece of porcelain.\n\n00:11:50.653 --> 00:11:52.807\nSo I loved, on an art historical level,\n\n00:11:52.807 --> 00:11:57.467\nI loved that layered quality that he has.\n\n00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.960\nBut more than that, I love him.\n\n00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.638\nIn a way that I think would have been impossible\n\n00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.250\nwithout the pink S\u00e8vres vase in my Leonardo days.\n\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.467\nI love his orange and pink breeches.\n\n00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:10.217\nI love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,\n\n00:12:10.217 --> 00:12:14.649\nhaving just finished the washing up. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:17.126\nHe seems also to have forgotten his sword.\n\n00:12:17.126 --> 00:12:19.745\nI love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.\n\n00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:22.936\nIn a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.\n\n00:12:22.936 --> 00:12:25.237\nHe's, I hope, a little bit dignified,\n\n00:12:25.237 --> 00:12:30.411\nbut mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:33.629\nAnd energetic, I hope, too.\n\n00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:38.784\nI let him into my life because the S\u00e8vres\npink elephant vase allowed me to do so.\n\n00:12:38.784 --> 00:12:40.352\nAnd before that Leonardo,\n\n00:12:40.352 --> 00:12:45.458\nI understood that this object could become \npart of a journey for me every day,\n\n00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:48.203\nsitting in my office.\n\n00:12:48.203 --> 00:12:51.192\nI really hope that others, all of you,\n\n00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:52.767\nvisiting objects in the museum,\n\n00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:55.221\nand taking them home and \nfinding them for yourselves,\n\n00:12:55.221 --> 00:12:59.535\nwill allow those objects to flourish \nin your imaginative lives.\n\n00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:01.088\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:01.088 --> 00:13:04.971\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Robots with \"soul\"", "duration": "1058", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/guy_hoffman_robots_with_soul", "transcript": "My job is to design, build and study robots that communicate with people. But this story doesn't start with robotics at all, it starts with animation. When I first saw Pixar's \"Luxo Jr.,\" I was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp. I mean, look at them \u2014 at the end of this movie, you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture.(Laughter)And I said, I have to learn how to do this. So I made a really bad career decision.(Laughter)And that's what my mom was like when I did it.(Laughter)I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company and I moved to New York to study animation. And there I lived in a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates. I'm not using this phrase metaphorically \u2014 the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room. Whenever they did news stories about building violations in New York, they would put the report in front of our building, as kind of, like, a backdrop to show how bad things are.Anyway, during the day, I went to school and at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation. And I learned two surprising lessons. One of them was that when you want to arouse emotions, it doesn't matter so much how something looks; it's all in the motion, in the timing of how the thing moves. And the second was something one of our teachers told us. He actually did the weasel in \"Ice Age.\" And he said, \"As an animator, you're not a director \u2014 you're an actor.\" So, if you want to find the right motion for a character, don't think about it \u2014 go use your body to find it. Stand in front of a mirror, act it out in front of a camera \u2014 whatever you need \u2014 and then put it back in your character.A year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group. It was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots. And I still had this dream to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp. But I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way that I was used to from my animation studies. Instead, they were all \u2014 how should I put it \u2014 they were all kind of robotic. (Laughter) And I thought, what if I took whatever I learned in animation school, and used that to design my robotic desk lamp. So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible. And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop \u2014 and I'm actually redesigning the robot, so, unbeknownst to itself, it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.(Laughter)I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light, and more of a helpful, kind of quiet apprentice that's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere. And when, for example, I'm looking for a battery that I can't find, in a subtle way, it'll show me where the battery is. So you can see my confusion here. I'm not an actor. And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can, at one point, just by the way it moves, seem gentle and caring and in the other case, seem violent and confrontational. And it's the same structure, just the motion is different. Actor: \"You want to know something? Well, you want to know something? He was already dead! Just laying there, eyes glazed over!\"(Laughter)But, moving in a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human-robot interaction. I was, at the time, doing my PhD, I was working on human-robot teamwork, teams of humans and robots working together. I was studying the engineering, the psychology, the philosophy of teamwork, and at the same time, I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation, with a good friend of mine, who's actually here. And in that situation, we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us. It was after a Passover Seder. We were folding up a lot of folding chairs, and I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm. Everybody did their own part, we didn't have to divide our tasks. We didn't have to communicate verbally about this \u2014 it all just happened.And I thought, humans and robots don't look at all like this. When humans and robots interact, it's much more like a chess game: the human does a thing, the robot analyzes whatever the human did, the robot decides what to do next, plans it and does it. Then the human waits, until it's their turn again. So it's much more like a chess game, and that makes sense, because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists. It's all about information, analysis, decision-making and planning.But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player, and more like a doer that just clicks and works together. So I made my second horrible career choice: I decided to study acting for a semester. I took off from the PhD, I went to acting classes. I actually participated in a play \u2014 I hope there\u2019s no video of that around still.(Laughter)And I got every book I could find about acting, including one from the 19th century that I got from the library. And I was really amazed, because my name was the second name on the list \u2014 the previous name was in 1889.(Laughter)And this book was kind of waiting for 100 years to be rediscovered for robotics. And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express.But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting. It became very popular in the 20th century. And method acting said you don't have to plan every muscle in your body; instead, you have to use your body to find the right movement. You have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression \u2014 improvise, play off your scene partner. And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology, called embodied cognition, which also talks about the same ideas. We use our bodies to think; we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move, but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave.And it was like a lightning bolt. I went back to my office, I wrote this paper, which I never really published, called \"Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence.\" And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together. That's what you saw before with the actors. And I thought: How can we make an artificial intelligence model \u2014 a computer, computational model \u2014 that will model some of these ideas of improvisation, of taking risks, of taking chances, even of making mistakes? Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates. So I worked for quite a long time on these models and I implemented them on a number of robots.Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movements as closely as possible. It's sort of like a game. Let's look at it. You can see when I psych it out, it gets fooled. And it's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them. And then, I did another experiment, and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp, and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence. So, I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot.The robot is the same lamp that you saw, and I put two brains in it. For one half of the people, I put in a brain that's kind of the traditional, calculated robotic brain. It waits for its turn, it analyzes everything, it plans. Let's call it the calculated brain. The other got more the stage actor, risk-taker brain. Let's call it the adventurous brain. It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know. It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them. And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost 20 minutes, and they had to work together, somehow simulating, like, a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing. What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent, more committed, a better member of the team, contributed to the success of the team more. They even called it \"he\" and \"she,\" whereas people with the calculated brain called it \"it,\" and nobody ever called it \"he\" or \"she.\" When they talked about it after the task, with the adventurous brain, they said, \"By the end, we were good friends and high-fived mentally.\" Whatever that means.(Laughter)Sounds painful. Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more, which is almost what people expect robots to do, so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing. And in a way, I thought, maybe it's time \u2014 just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century, from going from the very calculated, planned way of behaving, to a more intuitive, risk-taking, embodied way of behaving \u2014 maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution.A few years later, I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians. And I thought, music: that's the perfect place to look at teamwork, coordination, timing, improvisation \u2014 and we just got this robot playing marimba. And the marimba, for everybody like me, it was this huge, wooden xylophone. And when I was looking at this, I looked at other works in human-robot improvisation \u2014 yes, there are other works in human-robot improvisation \u2014 and they were also a little bit like a chess game. The human would play, the robot analyzed what was played, and would improvise their own part. So, this is what musicians called a call-and-response interaction, and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence. But I thought, if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies, maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band. Everybody's riffing off each other, nobody is stopping for a moment. And so I tried to do the same things, this time with music, where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play, it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play, and does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me. She said, when you improvise, sometimes you don't know what you're doing, and you still do it. So I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing, but is still doing it. So let's look at a few seconds from this performance, where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises. And then, look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior, and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Being a musician is not just about making notes, otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show. Musicians also communicate with their bodies, with other band members, with the audience, they use their bodies to express the music. And I thought, we already have a robot musician on stage, why not make it be a full-fledged musician? And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot. The head doesn\u2019t actually touch the marimba, it just expresses what the music is like. These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home. So I spent, I would say, on average, three to four hours a day there. I think.(Laughter)And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like, but especially what a robotic musician would move like, to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing \u2014 and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment.So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot, which was nice. I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance, this time with a socially expressive head. And notice one thing \u2014 how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing. And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo.(Music)Now it's looking at me, showing that it's listening.(Music)Now look at the final chord of the piece again. And this time the robot communicates with its body when it's busy doing its own thing, and when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me.(Music)(Music ending)(Final chord)(Applause)Thanks. I hope you see how much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance. And at some point \u2014 we are in Atlanta, so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point \u2014 and we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot. Here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat. Notice two things: one, how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head. You kind of want to move your own head when it does it. And second, even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone, as soon as the robot turns to him, he turns back. So even though it's just in the periphery of his vision, in the corner of his eye, it's very powerful. And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment. We are wired for that. So if you have a problem \u2014 maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much \u2014 you might want to have a robot there to get their attention.(Laughter)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on, it came out of something surprising that we found: Some point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent, able to improvise and listen, and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing. They really liked that the robot was enjoying the music.(Laughter)And they didn't say the robot was moving to the music, they said \"enjoying\" the music. And we thought, why don't we take this idea, and I designed a new piece of furniture. This time it wasn't a desk lamp, it was a speaker dock, one of those things you plug your smartphone in. And I thought, what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you, but would actually enjoy it, too? And so again, here are some animation tests from an early stage.(Laughter)And this is what the final product looked like.(Music)(Music ends)So, a lot of bobbing heads.(Applause)A lot of bobbing heads in the audience, so we can still see robots influence people. And it's not just fun and games.I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move is \u2014 I'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding \u2014 is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life. Somewhere in your future, there will be a robot in your life. If not in yours, your children's lives. And I want these robots to be more fluent, more engaging, more graceful than currently they seem to be. And for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians. Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise. Maybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do. Maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them, because in the end, we are human. And maybe as humans, robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1908, "subtitle":

arouse emotions,\n\n00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.171\nit doesn't matter so much\nhow something looks;\n\n00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:26.393\nit's all in the motion, in the timing\nof how the thing moves.\n\n00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:29.964\nAnd the second was something\none of our teachers told us.\n\n00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:32.281\nHe actually did the weasel in \"Ice Age.\"\n\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.477\nAnd he said, \"As an animator,\nyou're not a director -- you're an actor.\"\n\n00:01:36.853 --> 00:01:39.876\nSo, if you want to find\nthe right motion for a character,\n\n00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.345\ndon't think about it --\ngo use your body to find it.\n\n00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.302\nStand in front of a mirror,\nact it out in front of a camera --\n\n00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:48.264\nwhatever you need -- and then\nput it back in your character.\n\n00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:51.866\nA year later I found myself at MIT\nin the Robotic Life Group.\n\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.748\nIt was one of the first groups\nresearching the relationships\n\n00:01:54.772 --> 00:01:56.086\nbetween humans and robots.\n\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.066\nAnd I still had this dream\nto make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.\n\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.082\nBut I found that robots didn't move\nat all in this engaging way\n\n00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:05.281\nthat I was used to\nfrom my animation studies.\n\n00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.769\nInstead, they were all --\nhow should I put it --\n\n00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.247\nthey were all kind of robotic.\n\n00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:11.145\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.905\nAnd I thought, what if I took\nwhatever I learned in animation school,\n\n00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.532\nand used that to design\nmy robotic desk lamp.\n\n00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:19.601\nSo I went and designed frame by frame\n\n00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.585\nto try to make this robot as graceful\nand engaging as possible.\n\n00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:27.866\nAnd here when you see the robot\ninteracting with me on a desktop --\n\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.926\nand I'm actually redesigning the robot,\n\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.754\nso, unbeknownst to itself,\n\n00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:34.353\nit's kind of digging its own\ngrave by helping me.\n\n00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:36.383\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:39.646\nI wanted it to be less of a mechanical\nstructure giving me light,\n\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.688\nand more of a helpful,\nkind of quiet apprentice\n\n00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:45.881\nthat's always there when you need it\nand doesn't really interfere.\n\n00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:49.240\nAnd when, for example, I'm looking\nfor a battery that I can't find,\n\n00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:52.211\nin a subtle way, it'll show me\nwhere the battery is.\n\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.663\nSo you can see my confusion here.\n\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.612\nI'm not an actor.\n\n00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:03.576\nAnd I want you to notice\nhow the same mechanical structure\n\n00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.687\ncan, at one point,\njust by the way it moves,\n\n00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:07.855\nseem gentle and caring\nand in the other case,\n\n00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.250\nseem violent and confrontational.\n\n00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:13.121\nAnd it's the same structure,\njust the motion is different.\n\n00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:23.949\nActor: \"You want to know something?\nWell, you want to know something?\n\n00:03:23.973 --> 00:03:25.862\nHe was already dead!\n\n00:03:25.886 --> 00:03:29.788\nJust laying there, eyes glazed over!\"\n\n00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:30.833\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:33.913\nBut, moving in a graceful way\nis just one building block\n\n00:03:33.937 --> 00:03:36.532\nof this whole structure\ncalled human-robot interaction.\n\n00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:40.009\nI was, at the time, doing my PhD,\nI was working on human-robot teamwork,\n\n00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.095\nteams of humans and robots\nworking together.\n\n00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.754\nI was studying the engineering,\n\n00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:46.310\nthe psychology,\nthe philosophy of teamwork,\n\n00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:47.485\nand at the same time,\n\n00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.003\nI found myself in my own kind\nof teamwork situation,\n\n00:03:50.027 --> 00:03:52.279\nwith a good friend of mine,\nwho's actually here.\n\n00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:54.707\nAnd in that situation,\nwe can easily imagine robots\n\n00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.631\nin the near future being there with us.\n\n00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:58.345\nIt was after a Passover Seder.\n\n00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.424\nWe were folding up\na lot of folding chairs,\n\n00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.106\nand I was amazed at how quickly\nwe found our own rhythm.\n\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.240\nEverybody did their own part,\nwe didn't have to divide our tasks.\n\n00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:08.710\nWe didn't have to communicate\nverbally about this --\n\n00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:09.923\nit all just happened.\n\n00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:12.827\nAnd I thought, humans and robots\ndon't look at all like this.\n\n00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.982\nWhen humans and robots interact,\nit's much more like a chess game:\n\n00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.127\nthe human does a thing, the robot\nanalyzes whatever the human did,\n\n00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.794\nthe robot decides what to do next,\nplans it and does it.\n\n00:04:21.818 --> 00:04:24.173\nThen the human waits,\nuntil it's their turn again.\n\n00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.928\nSo it's much more like a chess game,\nand that makes sense,\n\n00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:30.063\nbecause chess is great for mathematicians\nand computer scientists.\n\n00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:33.515\nIt's all about information, analysis,\ndecision-making and planning.\n\n00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.269\nBut I wanted my robot\nto be less of a chess player,\n\n00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:39.086\nand more like a doer\n\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.111\nthat just clicks and works together.\n\n00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:44.504\nSo I made my second\nhorrible career choice:\n\n00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:47.081\nI decided to study acting for a semester.\n\n00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:50.024\nI took off from the PhD,\nI went to acting classes.\n\n00:04:50.048 --> 00:04:52.086\nI actually participated in a play --\n\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.412\nI hope there\u2019s no video\nof that around still.\n\n00:04:54.436 --> 00:04:55.474\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:55.498 --> 00:04:57.792\nAnd I got every book\nI could find about acting,\n\n00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.945\nincluding one from the 19th century\nthat I got from the library.\n\n00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.582\nAnd I was really amazed, because my name\nwas the second name on the list --\n\n00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:06.606\nthe previous name was in 1889.\n\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.645\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.918\nAnd this book was\nkind of waiting for 100 years\n\n00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:12.274\nto be rediscovered for robotics.\n\n00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:13.874\nAnd this book shows actors\n\n00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:16.136\nhow to move every muscle in the body\n\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.876\nto match every kind of emotion\nthat they want to express.\n\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.926\nBut the real revelation was\nwhen I learned about method acting.\n\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.203\nIt became very popular\nin the 20th century.\n\n00:05:24.227 --> 00:05:25.378\nAnd method acting said\n\n00:05:25.402 --> 00:05:27.702\nyou don't have to plan\nevery muscle in your body;\n\n00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:30.671\ninstead, you have to use your body\nto find the right movement.\n\n00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:33.575\nYou have to use your sense memory\nto reconstruct the emotions\n\n00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.637\nand kind of think with your body\nto find the right expression --\n\n00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.536\nimprovise, play off your scene partner.\n\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.005\nAnd this came at the same time\n\n00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.135\nas I was reading about this trend\nin cognitive psychology,\n\n00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.411\ncalled embodied cognition,\nwhich also talks about the same ideas.\n\n00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:47.950\nWe use our bodies to think;\n\n00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:50.931\nwe don't just think with our brains\nand use our bodies to move,\n\n00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:52.873\nbut our bodies feed back into our brain\n\n00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:55.062\nto generate the way that we behave.\n\n00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:56.682\nAnd it was like a lightning bolt.\n\n00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:57.920\nI went back to my office,\n\n00:05:57.944 --> 00:06:00.349\nI wrote this paper,\nwhich I never really published,\n\n00:06:00.373 --> 00:06:02.905\ncalled \"Acting Lessons\nfor Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\n00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.310\nAnd I even took another month\n\n00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:06.778\nto do what was then the first theater play\n\n00:06:06.802 --> 00:06:08.755\nwith a human and a robot acting together.\n\n00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.172\nThat's what you saw\nbefore with the actors.\n\n00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:13.673\nAnd I thought:\n\n00:06:13.697 --> 00:06:16.634\nHow can we make an artificial\nintelligence model --\n\n00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:18.641\na computer, computational model --\n\n00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:21.172\nthat will model some of these\nideas of improvisation,\n\n00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:23.026\nof taking risks, of taking chances,\n\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.577\neven of making mistakes?\n\n00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:27.214\nMaybe it can make for better\nrobotic teammates.\n\n00:06:27.238 --> 00:06:29.842\nSo I worked for quite\na long time on these models\n\n00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:32.261\nand I implemented them\non a number of robots.\n\n00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:34.586\nHere you can see a very early example\n\n00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.189\nwith the robots trying to use\nthis embodied artificial intelligence\n\n00:06:38.213 --> 00:06:40.676\nto try to match my movements\nas closely as possible.\n\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.163\nIt's sort of like a game.\n\n00:06:42.488 --> 00:06:43.697\nLet's look at it.\n\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.149\nYou can see when I psych\nit out, it gets fooled.\n\n00:06:51.656 --> 00:06:54.251\nAnd it's a little bit\nlike what you might see actors do\n\n00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:55.909\nwhen they try to mirror each other\n\n00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:58.298\nto find the right synchrony between them.\n\n00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:00.154\nAnd then, I did another experiment,\n\n00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:04.237\nand I got people off the street\nto use the robotic desk lamp,\n\n00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:07.363\nand try out this idea\nof embodied artificial intelligence.\n\n00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:12.477\nSo, I actually used two kinds\nof brains for the same robot.\n\n00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:14.453\nThe robot is the same lamp that you saw,\n\n00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:15.816\nand I put two brains in it.\n\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.567\nFor one half of the people,\n\n00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:20.527\nI put in a brain\nthat's kind of the traditional,\n\n00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:21.780\ncalculated robotic brain.\n\n00:07:21.804 --> 00:07:24.444\nIt waits for its turn,\nit analyzes everything, it plans.\n\n00:07:24.468 --> 00:07:26.150\nLet's call it the calculated brain.\n\n00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:29.421\nThe other got more the stage\nactor, risk-taker brain.\n\n00:07:29.445 --> 00:07:31.567\nLet's call it the adventurous brain.\n\n00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:34.528\nIt sometimes acts without knowing\neverything it has to know.\n\n00:07:34.552 --> 00:07:36.844\nIt sometimes makes mistakes\nand corrects them.\n\n00:07:36.868 --> 00:07:40.786\nAnd I had them do this very tedious task\nthat took almost 20 minutes,\n\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.286\nand they had to work together,\n\n00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.863\nsomehow simulating, like, a factory job\n\n00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:46.974\nof repetitively doing the same thing.\n\n00:07:47.403 --> 00:07:50.734\nWhat I found is that people\nactually loved the adventurous robot.\n\n00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:52.535\nThey thought it was more intelligent,\n\n00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:54.665\nmore committed,\na better member of the team,\n\n00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:56.754\ncontributed to the success\nof the team more.\n\n00:07:56.778 --> 00:07:58.486\nThey even called it \"he\" and \"she,\"\n\n00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.631\nwhereas people with the calculated brain\n\n00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:03.457\ncalled it \"it,\" and nobody\never called it \"he\" or \"she.\"\n\n00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:07.127\nWhen they talked about it after the task,\nwith the adventurous brain,\n\n00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:10.934\nthey said, \"By the end, we were good\nfriends and high-fived mentally.\"\n\n00:08:11.355 --> 00:08:12.648\nWhatever that means.\n\n00:08:12.672 --> 00:08:14.578\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:15.955\nSounds painful.\n\n00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:18.717\nWhereas the people\nwith the calculated brain\n\n00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:21.099\nsaid it was just like a lazy apprentice.\n\n00:08:21.123 --> 00:08:23.868\nIt only did what it was supposed\nto do and nothing more,\n\n00:08:23.892 --> 00:08:26.241\nwhich is almost what people\nexpect robots to do,\n\n00:08:26.265 --> 00:08:29.820\nso I was surprised that people\nhad higher expectations of robots\n\n00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:33.350\nthan what anybody in robotics\nthought robots should be doing.\n\n00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.000\nAnd in a way, I thought,\nmaybe it's time --\n\n00:08:36.024 --> 00:08:38.986\njust like method acting\nchanged the way people thought\n\n00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.606\nabout acting in the 19th century,\n\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.707\nfrom going from the very calculated,\nplanned way of behaving,\n\n00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:47.229\nto a more intuitive, risk-taking,\nembodied way of behaving --\n\n00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:50.449\nmaybe it's time for robots\nto have the same kind of revolution.\n\n00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:55.551\nA few years later, I was at my next\nresearch job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,\n\n00:08:55.575 --> 00:08:58.399\nand I was working in a group\ndealing with robotic musicians.\n\n00:08:58.423 --> 00:09:00.783\nAnd I thought, music:\nthat's the perfect place\n\n00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:04.950\nto look at teamwork, coordination,\ntiming, improvisation --\n\n00:09:04.974 --> 00:09:07.417\nand we just got this robot\nplaying marimba.\n\n00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:09.697\nAnd the marimba, for everybody like me,\n\n00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.460\nit was this huge, wooden xylophone.\n\n00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:14.547\nAnd when I was looking at this,\n\n00:09:14.571 --> 00:09:17.569\nI looked at other works\nin human-robot improvisation --\n\n00:09:17.593 --> 00:09:20.340\nyes, there are other works\nin human-robot improvisation --\n\n00:09:20.364 --> 00:09:22.713\nand they were also a little bit\nlike a chess game.\n\n00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:23.888\nThe human would play,\n\n00:09:23.912 --> 00:09:26.085\nthe robot analyzed what was played,\n\n00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:28.188\nand would improvise their own part.\n\n00:09:28.212 --> 00:09:31.350\nSo, this is what musicians called\na call-and-response interaction,\n\n00:09:31.374 --> 00:09:35.121\nand it also fits very well\nrobots and artificial intelligence.\n\n00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:38.398\nBut I thought, if I use the same ideas\nI used in the theater play\n\n00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:40.166\nand in the teamwork studies,\n\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.840\nmaybe I can make the robots\njam together like a band.\n\n00:09:43.864 --> 00:09:48.132\nEverybody's riffing off each other,\nnobody is stopping for a moment.\n\n00:09:48.156 --> 00:09:51.030\nAnd so I tried to do the same\nthings, this time with music,\n\n00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:53.888\nwhere the robot doesn't really know\nwhat it's about to play,\n\n00:09:53.912 --> 00:09:56.929\nit just sort of moves its body\nand uses opportunities to play,\n\n00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:59.492\nand does what my jazz teacher\nwhen I was 17 taught me.\n\n00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:00.913\nShe said, when you improvise,\n\n00:10:00.937 --> 00:10:03.953\nsometimes you don't know\nwhat you're doing, and you still do it.\n\n00:10:03.977 --> 00:10:07.303\nSo I tried to make a robot that doesn't\nactually know what it's doing,\n\n00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:08.548\nbut is still doing it.\n\n00:10:08.572 --> 00:10:11.083\nSo let's look at a few seconds\nfrom this performance,\n\n00:10:11.107 --> 00:10:13.234\nwhere the robot listens\nto the human musician\n\n00:10:13.258 --> 00:10:14.423\nand improvises.\n\n00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.422\nAnd then, look how the human\nmusician also responds\n\n00:10:17.446 --> 00:10:18.719\nto what the robot is doing\n\n00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.387\nand picking up from its behavior,\n\n00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:25.367\nand at some point can even be surprised\nby what the robot came up with.\n\n00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.585\n(Music)\n\n00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:09.576\n(Music ends)\n\n00:11:11.092 --> 00:11:16.826\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.100\nBeing a musician\nis not just about making notes,\n\n00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:21.472\notherwise nobody\nwould ever go see a live show.\n\n00:11:21.496 --> 00:11:23.618\nMusicians also communicate\nwith their bodies,\n\n00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:25.659\nwith other band members,\nwith the audience,\n\n00:11:25.683 --> 00:11:27.697\nthey use their bodies\nto express the music.\n\n00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:30.418\nAnd I thought, we already have\na robot musician on stage,\n\n00:11:30.442 --> 00:11:32.754\nwhy not make it be\na full-fledged musician?\n\n00:11:32.778 --> 00:11:35.452\nAnd I started designing\na socially expressive head\n\n00:11:35.476 --> 00:11:36.819\nfor the robot.\n\n00:11:36.843 --> 00:11:38.913\nThe head doesn\u2019t actually\ntouch the marimba,\n\n00:11:38.937 --> 00:11:40.896\nit just expresses what the music is like.\n\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.416\nThese are some napkin sketches\nfrom a bar in Atlanta\n\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.983\nthat was dangerously\nlocated exactly halfway\n\n00:11:46.007 --> 00:11:47.818\nbetween my lab and my home.\n\n00:11:47.842 --> 00:11:51.780\nSo I spent, I would say, on average,\nthree to four hours a day there.\n\n00:11:51.804 --> 00:11:52.991\nI think.\n\n00:11:53.015 --> 00:11:54.542\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:57.757\nAnd I went back to my animation\ntools and tried to figure out\n\n00:11:57.781 --> 00:12:00.151\nnot just what a robotic\nmusician would look like,\n\n00:12:00.175 --> 00:12:02.800\nbut especially what a robotic\nmusician would move like,\n\n00:12:02.824 --> 00:12:06.226\nto sort of show that it doesn't like\nwhat the other person is playing --\n\n00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.075\nand maybe show whatever beat\nit's feeling at the moment.\n\n00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:14.602\nSo we ended up actually getting the money\nto build this robot, which was nice.\n\n00:12:14.626 --> 00:12:17.230\nI'm going to show you now\nthe same kind of performance,\n\n00:12:17.254 --> 00:12:19.294\nthis time with a socially expressive head.\n\n00:12:19.318 --> 00:12:21.118\nAnd notice one thing --\n\n00:12:21.142 --> 00:12:22.813\nhow the robot is really showing us\n\n00:12:22.837 --> 00:12:24.743\nthe beat it's picking up from the human,\n\n00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:28.694\nwhile also giving the human a sense\nthat the robot knows what it's doing.\n\n00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:30.638\nAnd also how it changes the way it moves\n\n00:12:30.662 --> 00:12:32.614\nas soon as it starts its own solo.\n\n00:12:32.638 --> 00:12:36.534\n(Music)\n\n00:12:36.558 --> 00:12:39.578\nNow it's looking at me,\nshowing that it's listening.\n\n00:12:39.602 --> 00:12:42.325\n(Music)\n\n00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:04.060\nNow look at the final chord\nof the piece again.\n\n00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:07.001\nAnd this time the robot\ncommunicates with its body\n\n00:13:07.025 --> 00:13:09.138\nwhen it's busy doing its own thing,\n\n00:13:09.162 --> 00:13:14.013\nand when it's ready to coordinate\nthe final chord with me.\n\n00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:16.774\n(Music)\n\n00:13:21.741 --> 00:13:23.741\n(Music ending)\n\n00:13:26.061 --> 00:13:27.062\n(Final chord)\n\n00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:32.840\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:32.864 --> 00:13:34.019\nThanks.\n\n00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:35.624\nI hope you see\n\n00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:40.044\nhow much this part of the body\nthat doesn't touch the instrument\n\n00:13:40.068 --> 00:13:42.660\nactually helps\nwith the musical performance.\n\n00:13:43.118 --> 00:13:45.127\nAnd at some point -- we are in Atlanta,\n\n00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:48.401\nso obviously some rapper\nwill come into our lab at some point --\n\n00:13:48.425 --> 00:13:53.218\nand we had this rapper come in and do\na little jam with the robot.\n\n00:13:53.242 --> 00:13:57.290\nHere you can see the robot\nbasically responding to the beat.\n\n00:13:57.314 --> 00:13:58.465\nNotice two things:\n\n00:13:58.489 --> 00:14:02.098\none, how irresistible it is to join\nthe robot while it's moving its head.\n\n00:14:02.122 --> 00:14:04.725\nYou kind of want to move\nyour own head when it does it.\n\n00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:08.335\nAnd second, even though the rapper\nis really focused on his iPhone,\n\n00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:11.469\nas soon as the robot turns\nto him, he turns back.\n\n00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:14.129\nSo even though it's just\nin the periphery of his vision,\n\n00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.273\nin the corner of his eye,\nit's very powerful.\n\n00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:18.131\nAnd the reason is that we can't ignore\n\n00:14:18.155 --> 00:14:20.179\nphysical things moving in our environment.\n\n00:14:20.203 --> 00:14:21.373\nWe are wired for that.\n\n00:14:21.397 --> 00:14:23.041\nSo if you have a problem --\n\n00:14:23.065 --> 00:14:27.740\nmaybe your partner is looking\nat their iPhone or smartphone too much --\n\n00:14:27.764 --> 00:14:30.598\nyou might want to have a robot\nthere to get their attention.\n\n00:14:30.622 --> 00:14:31.623\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:33.716\n(Music)\n\n00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:48.071\n(Music ends)\n\n00:14:50.096 --> 00:14:57.044\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:01.425\nJust to introduce the last robot\nthat we've worked on,\n\n00:15:01.449 --> 00:15:03.799\nit came out of something\nsurprising that we found:\n\n00:15:03.823 --> 00:15:06.981\nSome point people didn't care\nabout the robot being intelligent,\n\n00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:08.407\nable to improvise and listen,\n\n00:15:08.431 --> 00:15:12.837\nand do all these embodied intelligence\nthings that I spent years developing.\n\n00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:15.542\nThey really liked that the robot\nwas enjoying the music.\n\n00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:16.567\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:19.136\nAnd they didn't say the robot\nwas moving to the music,\n\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.648\nthey said \"enjoying\" the music.\n\n00:15:20.672 --> 00:15:22.798\nAnd we thought,\nwhy don't we take this idea,\n\n00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:25.563\nand I designed a new piece of furniture.\n\n00:15:25.587 --> 00:15:28.159\nThis time it wasn't a desk lamp,\nit was a speaker dock,\n\n00:15:28.183 --> 00:15:30.823\none of those things\nyou plug your smartphone in.\n\n00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:31.997\nAnd I thought,\n\n00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:35.521\nwhat would happen if your speaker dock\ndidn't just play the music for you,\n\n00:15:35.545 --> 00:15:37.591\nbut would actually enjoy it, too?\n\n00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:41.776\nAnd so again, here are some\nanimation tests from an early stage.\n\n00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.184\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:43.793 --> 00:15:46.664\nAnd this is what the final\nproduct looked like.\n\n00:15:58.205 --> 00:16:00.386\n(Music)\n\n00:16:18.806 --> 00:16:20.806\n(Music ends)\n\n00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:24.039\nSo, a lot of bobbing heads.\n\n00:16:24.063 --> 00:16:27.674\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:27.698 --> 00:16:29.588\nA lot of bobbing heads in the audience,\n\n00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:32.320\nso we can still see\nrobots influence people.\n\n00:16:32.344 --> 00:16:35.129\nAnd it's not just fun and games.\n\n00:16:35.153 --> 00:16:37.354\nI think one of the reasons I care so much\n\n00:16:37.378 --> 00:16:39.611\nabout robots that use\ntheir body to communicate\n\n00:16:39.635 --> 00:16:41.341\nand use their body to move is --\n\n00:16:41.365 --> 00:16:44.755\nI'm going to let you in on a little\nsecret we roboticists are hiding --\n\n00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:47.572\nis that every one of you\nis going to be living with a robot\n\n00:16:47.596 --> 00:16:49.188\nat some point in your life.\n\n00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:52.145\nSomewhere in your future,\nthere will be a robot in your life.\n\n00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:54.037\nIf not in yours, your children's lives.\n\n00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:59.051\nAnd I want these robots to be more fluent,\nmore engaging, more graceful\n\n00:16:59.075 --> 00:17:00.804\nthan currently they seem to be.\n\n00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:04.115\nAnd for that I think maybe robots\nneed to be less like chess players\n\n00:17:04.139 --> 00:17:06.780\nand more like stage actors\nand more like musicians.\n\n00:17:06.804 --> 00:17:09.617\nMaybe they should be able\nto take chances and improvise.\n\n00:17:09.641 --> 00:17:12.665\nMaybe they should be able\nto anticipate what you're about to do.\n\n00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:16.037\nMaybe they even need to be able\nto make mistakes and correct them,\n\n00:17:16.061 --> 00:17:17.949\nbecause in the end, we are human.\n\n00:17:17.973 --> 00:17:21.527\nAnd maybe as humans,\nrobots that are a little less than perfect\n\n00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:23.282\nare just perfect for us.\n\n00:17:23.306 --> 00:17:24.465\nThank you.\n\n00:17:24.489 --> 00:17:31.325\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A little-told tale of sex and sensuality", "duration": "970", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shereen_el_feki_a_little_told_tale_of_sex_and_sensuality", "transcript": "So when I was in Morocco, in Casablanca, not so long ago, I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza. Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception, pregnancy, and delivery.It was a remarkable tale, but Faiza saved the best for last. \"You know, I am a virgin,\" she told me. \"I have two medical certificates to prove it.\"This is the modern Middle East, where two millennia after the coming of Christ, virgin births are still a fact of life.Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard  over the years, traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. Now, I know this might sound like a dream job, or possibly a highly dubious occupation,but for me, it's something else altogether. I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim. But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.Like so many who straddle East and West, I've been drawn, over the years, to try to better understand my origins. That I chose to look at sex comes from  my background in HIV/AIDS, as a writer and a researcher and an activist. Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa, which is one of only two regions in the world where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society, because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage: in politics and economics, in religion and tradition,  in gender and generations. As I found, if you really want to know a people, you start by looking inside their bedrooms.Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied. But running across it are three red lines \u2014 these are topics you are not supposed  to challenge in word or deed.The first of these is politics. But the Arab Spring has changed all that, in uprisings which have blossomed  across the region since 2011. Now while those in power, old and new, continue to cling to business as usual, millions are still pushing back, and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life.That second red line is religion. But now religion and politics are connected, with the rise of such groups as the  Muslim Brotherhood. And some people, at least, are starting  to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life.You know, as for that third red line,  that off-limits subject, what do you think it might be?Audience: Sex.Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.Audience: Sex.SEF: Again, please don't be shy.Audience: Sex.SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter) Across the Arab region, the only accepted context for sex is marriage \u2014 approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. Marriage is your ticket to adulthood. If you don't tie the knot, you can't  move out of your parents' place, and you're not supposed to be having sex, and you're definitely not supposed  to be having children.It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault, any alternative. And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex, against condoms, against abortion, against homosexuality, you name it.Faiza was living proof of this. Her virginity statement was  not a piece of wishful thinking. Although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity, in a patriarchy, boys will be boys. Men have sex before marriage, and people more or less turn a blind eye.Not so for women, who are expected to be virgins  on their wedding night \u2014 that is, to turn up with your hymen intact. This is not a question of individual concern, this is a matter of family honor,  and in particular, men's honor.And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve  this tiny piece of anatomy \u2014 from female genital mutilation, to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.Faiza chose a different route: non-vaginal sex. Only she became pregnant all the same. But Faiza didn't actually realize this, because there's so little  sexuality education in schools, and so little communication in the family.When her condition became hard to hide, Faiza's mother helped her flee  her father and brothers. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at  a hospital in Casablanca, the man who offered to help her, instead tried to rape her.Sadly, Faiza is not alone. In Egypt, where my research is focused, I have seen plenty of trouble  in and out of the citadel. There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married, because marriage has become  a very expensive proposition. They are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life, but they can't find jobs. This is one of the major drivers  of the recent uprisings, and it is one of the reasons for the  rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region.There are career women who want to get married, but can't find a husband, because they defy gender expectations, or as one young female doctor  in Tunisia put it to me, \"The women, they are becoming more and more open. But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage.\"And then there are men and women who  cross the heterosexual line, who have sex with their own sex, or who have a different gender identity. They are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities, even their appearance. And they face a daily struggle with social stigma, with family despair, and with religious fire and brimstone.Now, it's not as if it's all rosy  in the marital bed either. Couples who are looking for greater happiness, greater sexual happiness in their married lives, but are at a loss of how to achieve it, especially wives, who are afraid  of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom.And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution. They have been sold by their families, often to wealthy Arab tourists. This is just one face of a booming  sex trade across the Arab region.Now raise your hand if any of  this is sounding familiar to you, from your part of the world. Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups.And although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening  inside bedrooms across the Arab region, It's pretty clear that  something is not right. Double standards for men and women, sex as a source of shame, family control limiting individual choices, and a vast gulf between appearance and reality: what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to, and a general reluctance to move  beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion.As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me, \"Here, sex is the opposite of sport. Football, everybody talks about it, but hardly anyone plays. But sex, everybody is doing it, but nobody wants to talk about it.\" (Laughter)(Music) (In Arabic)SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice, which if you follow it, will make you happy in life.When your husband reaches out to you, when he seizes a part of your body, sigh deeply and look at him lustily.When he penetrates you with his penis, try to talk flirtatiously and  move yourself in harmony with him.Hot stuff! And it might sound that these handy hints come from \"The Joy of Sex\" or YouPorn. But in fact, they come from a 10th-century Arabic book called \"The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,\" which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia, and everything in between.The Encyclopedia is just one  in a long line of Arabic erotica, much of it written by religious scholars. Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad, there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex: not just its problems, but also its pleasures, and not just for men, but also for women. A thousand years ago, we used to have  whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic. Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature, position and preference, a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body  of the woman you see on this page.Today, this history is largely unknown  in the Arab region. Even by educated people, who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue. Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution.But while the West has opened on sex, what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction. In Egypt and many of its neighbors, this closing down is part of a wider closing in political, social and cultural thought. And it is the product of a complex historical process, one which has gained ground with the rise  of Islamic conservatism since the late 1970s. \"Just say no\" is what conservatives  around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo. In the Arab region, they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values. But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control: sex wrapped up in religion.But history shows us that  even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day, there have been times of greater pragmatism, and tolerance, and a willingness to consider other interpretations: be it abortion, or masturbation, or even  the incendiary topic of homosexuality. It is not black and white, as conservatives would have us believe. In these, as in so many other matters, Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray. (Laughter)Over my travels, I've met men and women  across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum \u2014 sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages, innovators who are managing to get  sexuality education into schools, small groups of men and women, lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual, who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real-world support. Women, and increasingly men, who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home. Groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards, and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society, and critically, stay with their kids.Now these efforts are small,  they're often underfunded, and they face formidable opposition. But I am optimistic that, in the long run, times are changing, and they and their ideas will gain ground. Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation, beating or indeed baring of breasts, but rather through negotiation.What we're talking here is not about a  sexual revolution, but a sexual evolution,  learning from other parts of the world, adapting to local conditions, forging our own path, not following one blazed by another. That path, I hope, will one day lead us  to the right to control our own bodies, and to access the information  and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives. The right to express our ideas freely, to marry whom we choose,  to choose our own partners, to be sexually active or not, to decide whether to have children and when, all this without violence or force or discrimination.Now we are very far from this  across the Arab region, and so much needs to change: law, education, media, the economy, the list goes on and on, and it is the work of a generation, at least.But it begins with a journey that I myself have made, asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life. And it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith, and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities  where I once only saw absolutes.Now given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region, talking about sex,  challenging the taboos, seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury.But at this critical moment in history, if we do not anchor freedom and justice, dignity and equality, privacy and autonomy in our personal lives, in our sexual lives, we will find it very hard to achieve in public life.The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows, and that is true for us all. no matter where we live and love.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1909, "subtitle":

--> 00:00:22.126\nI met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.\n\n00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.463\nFaiza showed me photos of her infant son\n\n00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:31.598\nand she told me the story of his conception,\npregnancy, and delivery.\n\n00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.558\nIt was a remarkable tale,\n\n00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:37.238\nbut Faiza saved the best for last.\n\n00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:40.808\n\"You know, I am a virgin,\" she told me.\n\n00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:45.212\n\"I have two medical certificates to prove it.\"\n\n00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.836\nThis is the modern Middle East,\n\n00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:50.468\nwhere two millennia after the coming of Christ,\n\n00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:54.696\nvirgin births are still a fact of life.\n\n00:00:54.696 --> 00:01:00.353\nFaiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard \nover the years, traveling across the Arab region\n\n00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:03.641\ntalking to people about sex.\n\n00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:06.857\nNow, I know this might sound like a dream job,\n\n00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:10.125\nor possibly a highly dubious occupation,\n\n00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:13.481\nbut for me, it's something else altogether.\n\n00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:16.069\nI'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.\n\n00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.860\nBut I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.\n\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.494\nLike so many who straddle East and West,\n\n00:01:22.494 --> 00:01:27.417\nI've been drawn, over the years, to try to better\nunderstand my origins.\n\n00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:31.537\nThat I chose to look at sex comes from \nmy background in HIV/AIDS,\n\n00:01:31.537 --> 00:01:35.624\nas a writer and a researcher and an activist.\n\n00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:40.748\nSex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic\nin the Middle East and North Africa,\n\n00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:47.293\nwhich is one of only two regions in the world\nwhere HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.\n\n00:01:47.293 --> 00:01:50.334\nNow sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens\n\n00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:53.058\nwith which to study any society,\n\n00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:55.567\nbecause what happens in our intimate lives\n\n00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:59.741\nis reflected by forces on a bigger stage:\n\n00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:05.815\nin politics and economics, in religion and tradition, \nin gender and generations.\n\n00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:09.102\nAs I found, if you really want to know a people,\n\n00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:13.626\nyou start by looking inside their bedrooms.\n\n00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:17.818\nNow to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.\n\n00:02:17.818 --> 00:02:20.479\nBut running across it are three red lines --\n\n00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:25.693\nthese are topics you are not supposed \nto challenge in word or deed.\n\n00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:28.108\nThe first of these is politics.\n\n00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:30.536\nBut the Arab Spring has changed all that,\n\n00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:35.558\nin uprisings which have blossomed \nacross the region since 2011.\n\n00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:38.419\nNow while those in power, old and new,\n\n00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.221\ncontinue to cling to business as usual,\n\n00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:43.827\nmillions are still pushing back,\n\n00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:48.942\nand pushing forward to what they hope\nwill be a better life.\n\n00:02:48.942 --> 00:02:52.122\nThat second red line is religion.\n\n00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:54.953\nBut now religion and politics are connected,\n\n00:02:54.953 --> 00:02:58.097\nwith the rise of such groups as the \nMuslim Brotherhood.\n\n00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:01.557\nAnd some people, at least, are starting \nto ask questions\n\n00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:06.625\nabout the role of Islam in public and private life.\n\n00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.376\nYou know, as for that third red line, \nthat off-limits subject,\n\n00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.154\nwhat do you think it might be?\n\n00:03:12.154 --> 00:03:13.216\nAudience: Sex.\n\n00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:14.516\nShereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.\n\n00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:15.372\nAudience: Sex.\n\n00:03:15.372 --> 00:03:16.994\nSEF: Again, please don't be shy.\n\n00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.046\nAudience: Sex.\n\n00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:25.103\nSEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:31.311\nAcross the Arab region, the only accepted\ncontext for sex is marriage --\n\n00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:35.089\napproved by your parents, sanctioned by religion\n\n00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.629\nand registered by the state.\n\n00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.512\nMarriage is your ticket to adulthood.\n\n00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:44.337\nIf you don't tie the knot, you can't \nmove out of your parents' place,\n\n00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:46.638\nand you're not supposed to be having sex,\n\n00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:49.785\nand you're definitely not supposed \nto be having children.\n\n00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:53.151\nIt's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress\n\n00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:57.616\nwhich resists any assault, any alternative.\n\n00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:01.624\nAnd around the fortress is this vast field of taboo\n\n00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:06.597\nagainst premarital sex, against condoms,\n\n00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:09.541\nagainst abortion, against homosexuality,\n\n00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.712\nyou name it.\n\n00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:14.936\nFaiza was living proof of this.\n\n00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:19.217\nHer virginity statement was \nnot a piece of wishful thinking.\n\n00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:24.540\nAlthough the major religions of the region\nextoll premarital chastity,\n\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.844\nin a patriarchy, boys will be boys.\n\n00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:29.797\nMen have sex before marriage,\n\n00:04:29.797 --> 00:04:33.587\nand people more or less turn a blind eye.\n\n00:04:33.587 --> 00:04:35.803\nNot so for women,\n\n00:04:35.803 --> 00:04:38.847\nwho are expected to be virgins \non their wedding night --\n\n00:04:38.847 --> 00:04:43.097\nthat is, to turn up with your hymen intact.\n\n00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:46.772\nThis is not a question of individual concern,\n\n00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:51.914\nthis is a matter of family honor, \nand in particular, men's honor.\n\n00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:53.672\nAnd so women and their relatives\n\n00:04:53.672 --> 00:04:58.031\nwill go to great lengths to preserve \nthis tiny piece of anatomy --\n\n00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.236\nfrom female genital mutilation,\n\n00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:04.597\nto virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.\n\n00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:07.603\nFaiza chose a different route:\n\n00:05:07.603 --> 00:05:09.986\nnon-vaginal sex.\n\n00:05:09.986 --> 00:05:12.595\nOnly she became pregnant all the same.\n\n00:05:12.595 --> 00:05:15.335\nBut Faiza didn't actually realize this,\n\n00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:19.110\nbecause there's so little \nsexuality education in schools,\n\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.132\nand so little communication in the family.\n\n00:05:23.132 --> 00:05:25.887\nWhen her condition became hard to hide,\n\n00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:30.334\nFaiza's mother helped her flee \nher father and brothers.\n\n00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:33.355\nThis is because honor killings are a real threat\n\n00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:37.129\nfor untold numbers of women in the Arab region.\n\n00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.179\nAnd so when Faiza eventually fetched up at \na hospital in Casablanca,\n\n00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.856\nthe man who offered to help her,\n\n00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:48.220\ninstead tried to rape her.\n\n00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:53.417\nSadly, Faiza is not alone.\n\n00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:55.203\nIn Egypt, where my research is focused,\n\n00:05:55.203 --> 00:06:00.801\nI have seen plenty of trouble \nin and out of the citadel.\n\n00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.140\nThere are legions of young men\n\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.247\nwho can't afford to get married,\n\n00:06:06.247 --> 00:06:09.671\nbecause marriage has become \na very expensive proposition.\n\n00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:13.230\nThey are expected to bear the burden\nof costs in married life,\n\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.534\nbut they can't find jobs.\n\n00:06:15.534 --> 00:06:18.708\nThis is one of the major drivers \nof the recent uprisings,\n\n00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:21.873\nand it is one of the reasons for the \nrising age of marriage\n\n00:06:21.873 --> 00:06:24.904\nin much of the Arab region.\n\n00:06:24.904 --> 00:06:27.679\nThere are career women who want to get married,\n\n00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.277\nbut can't find a husband,\n\n00:06:29.277 --> 00:06:32.462\nbecause they defy gender expectations,\n\n00:06:32.462 --> 00:06:36.249\nor as one young female doctor \nin Tunisia put it to me,\n\n00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.956\n\"The women, they are becoming more and more open.\n\n00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:44.759\nBut the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage.\"\n\n00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:48.649\nAnd then there are men and women who \ncross the heterosexual line,\n\n00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:50.551\nwho have sex with their own sex,\n\n00:06:50.551 --> 00:06:53.560\nor who have a different gender identity.\n\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.513\nThey are on the receiving end of laws\nwhich punish their activities,\n\n00:06:57.513 --> 00:06:59.571\neven their appearance.\n\n00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.406\nAnd they face a daily struggle with social stigma,\n\n00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:05.041\nwith family despair,\n\n00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:09.209\nand with religious fire and brimstone.\n\n00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:13.407\nNow, it's not as if it's all rosy \nin the marital bed either.\n\n00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:15.933\nCouples who are looking for greater happiness,\n\n00:07:15.933 --> 00:07:18.572\ngreater sexual happiness in their married lives,\n\n00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:20.931\nbut are at a loss of how to achieve it,\n\n00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:25.453\nespecially wives, who are afraid \nof being seen as bad women\n\n00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:28.657\nif they show some spark in the bedroom.\n\n00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.581\nAnd then there are those whose marriages\n\n00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:33.687\nare actually a veil for prostitution.\n\n00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:35.845\nThey have been sold by their families,\n\n00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:38.726\noften to wealthy Arab tourists.\n\n00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:44.327\nThis is just one face of a booming \nsex trade across the Arab region.\n\n00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:48.515\nNow raise your hand if any of \nthis is sounding familiar to you,\n\n00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:52.485\nfrom your part of the world.\n\n00:07:52.485 --> 00:07:58.495\nYeah. It's not as if the Arab world\nhas a monopoly on sexual hangups.\n\n00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:01.465\nAnd although we don't yet have\nan Arab Kinsey Report\n\n00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:05.878\nto tell us exactly what's happening \ninside bedrooms across the Arab region,\n\n00:08:05.878 --> 00:08:09.821\nIt's pretty clear that \nsomething is not right.\n\n00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:12.509\nDouble standards for men and women,\n\n00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:15.768\nsex as a source of shame,\n\n00:08:15.768 --> 00:08:19.919\nfamily control limiting individual choices,\n\n00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:23.666\nand a vast gulf between appearance and reality:\n\n00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:25.236\nwhat people are doing\n\n00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:27.597\nand what they're willing to admit to,\n\n00:08:27.597 --> 00:08:31.573\nand a general reluctance to move \nbeyond private whispers\n\n00:08:31.573 --> 00:08:35.661\nto a serious and sustained public discussion.\n\n00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:39.150\nAs one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,\n\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.475\n\"Here, sex is the opposite of sport.\n\n00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:44.641\nFootball, everybody talks about it,\n\n00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:46.611\nbut hardly anyone plays.\n\n00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:48.584\nBut sex, everybody is doing it,\n\n00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:52.733\nbut nobody wants to talk about it.\"\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:52.733 --> 00:09:03.306\n(Music) (In Arabic)\n\n00:09:03.306 --> 00:09:05.965\nSEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,\n\n00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:10.059\nwhich if you follow it,\nwill make you happy in life.\n\n00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:12.434\nWhen your husband reaches out to you,\n\n00:09:12.434 --> 00:09:15.246\nwhen he seizes a part of your body,\n\n00:09:15.246 --> 00:09:18.612\nsigh deeply and look at him lustily.\n\n00:09:18.612 --> 00:09:21.135\nWhen he penetrates you with his penis,\n\n00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:26.428\ntry to talk flirtatiously and \nmove yourself in harmony with him.\n\n00:09:26.428 --> 00:09:27.871\nHot stuff!\n\n00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:29.880\nAnd it might sound that these handy hints\n\n00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.991\ncome from \"The Joy of Sex\" or YouPorn.\n\n00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:36.843\nBut in fact, they come from\na 10th-century Arabic book\n\n00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:39.175\ncalled \"The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,\"\n\n00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:43.323\nwhich covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,\n\n00:09:43.323 --> 00:09:46.396\nand everything in between.\n\n00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:50.454\nThe Encyclopedia is just one \nin a long line of Arabic erotica,\n\n00:09:50.454 --> 00:09:53.683\nmuch of it written by religious scholars.\n\n00:09:53.683 --> 00:09:56.044\nGoing right back to the Prophet Muhammad,\n\n00:09:56.044 --> 00:09:58.461\nthere is a rich tradition in Islam\n\n00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:01.041\nof talking frankly about sex:\n\n00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:04.336\nnot just its problems, but also its pleasures,\n\n00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:08.911\nand not just for men, but also for women.\n\n00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:14.778\nA thousand years ago, we used to have \nwhole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.\n\n00:10:14.778 --> 00:10:18.931\nWords to cover every conceivable sexual feature,\n\n00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:22.523\nposition and preference, a body of language\n\n00:10:22.523 --> 00:10:29.054\nthat was rich enough to make up the body \nof the woman you see on this page.\n\n00:10:29.054 --> 00:10:32.657\nToday, this history is largely unknown \nin the Arab region.\n\n00:10:32.657 --> 00:10:37.461\nEven by educated people, who often\nfeel more comfortable talking about sex\n\n00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:42.439\nin a foreign language than they do\nin their own tongue.\n\n00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:46.162\nToday's sexual landscape looks\na lot like Europe and America\n\n00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:48.895\non the brink of the sexual revolution.\n\n00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:51.943\nBut while the West has opened on sex,\n\n00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:58.576\nwhat we found is that Arab societies appear\nto have been moving in the opposite direction.\n\n00:10:58.576 --> 00:11:00.831\nIn Egypt and many of its neighbors,\n\n00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:03.708\nthis closing down is part of a wider closing\n\n00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:07.291\nin political, social and cultural thought.\n\n00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:11.347\nAnd it is the product of a complex historical process,\n\n00:11:11.347 --> 00:11:15.140\none which has gained ground with the rise \nof Islamic conservatism\n\n00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.141\nsince the late 1970s.\n\n00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:21.816\n\"Just say no\" is what conservatives \naround the world\n\n00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:26.278\nsay to any challenge to the sexual status quo.\n\n00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:30.564\nIn the Arab region, they brand these attempts\nas a Western conspiracy\n\n00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:34.866\nto undermine traditional Arab\nand Islamic values.\n\n00:11:34.866 --> 00:11:36.865\nBut what's really at stake here\n\n00:11:36.865 --> 00:11:40.759\nis one of their most powerful tools of control:\n\n00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:44.916\nsex wrapped up in religion.\n\n00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:48.061\nBut history shows us that \neven as recently\n\n00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:50.970\nas our fathers' and grandfathers' day,\n\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.919\nthere have been times of greater pragmatism,\n\n00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:59.439\nand tolerance, and a willingness\nto consider other interpretations:\n\n00:11:59.439 --> 00:12:06.358\nbe it abortion, or masturbation, or even \nthe incendiary topic of homosexuality.\n\n00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:11.224\nIt is not black and white,\nas conservatives would have us believe.\n\n00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:14.431\nIn these, as in so many other matters,\n\n00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:17.852\nIslam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.\n\n00:12:17.852 --> 00:12:20.266\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:20.266 --> 00:12:21.415\nOver my travels,\n\n00:12:21.415 --> 00:12:24.023\nI've met men and women \nacross the Arab region\n\n00:12:24.023 --> 00:12:27.016\nwho've been exploring that spectrum --\n\n00:12:27.016 --> 00:12:29.720\nsexologists who are trying\nto help couples\n\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.642\nfind greater happiness in their marriages,\n\n00:12:33.642 --> 00:12:39.324\ninnovators who are managing to get \nsexuality education into schools,\n\n00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:41.691\nsmall groups of men and women,\n\n00:12:41.691 --> 00:12:44.407\nlesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,\n\n00:12:44.407 --> 00:12:46.088\nwho are reaching out to their peers\n\n00:12:46.088 --> 00:12:50.746\nwith online initiatives and real-world support.\n\n00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:54.709\nWomen, and increasingly men,\nwho are starting to speak out\n\n00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:57.795\nand push back against sexual violence\n\n00:12:57.795 --> 00:13:01.351\non the streets and in the home.\n\n00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:06.084\nGroups that are trying to help sex workers\nprotect themselves against HIV\n\n00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:08.951\nand other occupational hazards,\n\n00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:12.879\nand NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza\n\n00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:18.660\nfind a place in society, and critically,\nstay with their kids.\n\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.071\nNow these efforts are small, \nthey're often underfunded,\n\n00:13:22.071 --> 00:13:25.374\nand they face formidable opposition.\n\n00:13:25.374 --> 00:13:28.902\nBut I am optimistic that, in the long run,\n\n00:13:28.902 --> 00:13:32.279\ntimes are changing, and they and their ideas\n\n00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.208\nwill gain ground.\n\n00:13:34.208 --> 00:13:39.860\nSocial change doesn't happen in the Arab region\nthrough dramatic confrontation,\n\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.247\nbeating or indeed baring of breasts,\n\n00:13:43.247 --> 00:13:45.712\nbut rather through negotiation.\n\n00:13:45.712 --> 00:13:49.382\nWhat we're talking here is not about a \nsexual revolution,\n\n00:13:49.382 --> 00:13:53.856\nbut a sexual evolution, \nlearning from other parts of the world,\n\n00:13:53.856 --> 00:13:56.232\nadapting to local conditions,\n\n00:13:56.232 --> 00:14:02.119\nforging our own path,\nnot following one blazed by another.\n\n00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:08.562\nThat path, I hope, will one day lead us \nto the right to control our own bodies,\n\n00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:11.632\nand to access the information \nand services we need\n\n00:14:11.632 --> 00:14:16.036\nto lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.\n\n00:14:16.036 --> 00:14:18.606\nThe right to express our ideas freely,\n\n00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:23.261\nto marry whom we choose, \nto choose our own partners,\n\n00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:28.113\nto be sexually active or not,\nto decide whether to have children and when,\n\n00:14:28.113 --> 00:14:34.492\nall this without violence or force or discrimination.\n\n00:14:34.492 --> 00:14:37.896\nNow we are very far from this \nacross the Arab region,\n\n00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:41.003\nand so much needs to change:\n\n00:14:41.003 --> 00:14:44.931\nlaw, education, media, the economy,\n\n00:14:44.931 --> 00:14:47.804\nthe list goes on and on,\n\n00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:52.122\nand it is the work of a generation, at least.\n\n00:14:52.122 --> 00:14:55.284\nBut it begins with a journey that I myself have made,\n\n00:14:55.284 --> 00:14:58.253\nasking hard questions of received wisdoms\n\n00:14:58.253 --> 00:15:00.061\nin sexual life.\n\n00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:04.574\nAnd it is a journey which has\nonly served to strengthen my faith,\n\n00:15:04.574 --> 00:15:08.092\nand my appreciation of local histories and cultures\n\n00:15:08.092 --> 00:15:13.887\nby showing me possibilities \nwhere I once only saw absolutes.\n\n00:15:13.887 --> 00:15:17.344\nNow given the turmoil in many\ncountries in the Arab region,\n\n00:15:17.344 --> 00:15:20.421\ntalking about sex, \nchallenging the taboos,\n\n00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:25.757\nseeking alternatives might sound like\nsomething of a luxury.\n\n00:15:25.757 --> 00:15:28.549\nBut at this critical moment in history,\n\n00:15:28.549 --> 00:15:32.927\nif we do not anchor freedom and justice,\n\n00:15:32.927 --> 00:15:34.559\ndignity and equality,\n\n00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:39.801\nprivacy and autonomy in our personal lives,\nin our sexual lives,\n\n00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:44.102\nwe will find it very hard to achieve in public life.\n\n00:15:44.102 --> 00:15:50.857\nThe political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows,\nand that is true for us all.\n\n00:15:50.857 --> 00:15:54.268\nno matter where we live and love.\n\n00:15:54.268 --> 00:15:55.784\nThank you.\n\n00:15:55.784 --> 00:16:00.225\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "His and hers \u2026 healthcare", "duration": "882", "url":

home in Brooklyn, New York. Her apartment was an oasis. It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee, which was really warm milk  with just a touch of caffeine. She loved life. And although she worked in a factory, she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe. And I remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music.And then, when I was eight and she was 60, something changed. She no longer worked or traveled. She no longer danced. There were no more coffee times. My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn't make a diagnosis. And my father, who worked at night,  would spend every afternoon with her, just to make sure she ate.Her care became all-consuming for our family. And by the time a diagnosis was made, she was in a deep spiral.Now many of you will recognize her symptoms. My grandmother had depression. A deep, life-altering depression, from which she never recovered. And back then, so little  was known about depression.But even today, 50 years later, there's still so much more to learn. Today, we know that women  are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men. And even with this high prevalence, women are misdiagnosed between  30 and 50 percent of the time.Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms  of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain and anxiety compared with men. And these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression.And it isn't only depression in which  these sex differences occur, but they occur across so many diseases.So it's my grandmother's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest. And today, I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women.Today, we know that every cell has a sex. Now, that's a term coined  by the Institute of Medicine. And what it means is that  men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels. It means that we're different  across all of our organs. From our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.Now, it was only 20 years ago that we hardly had any data on women's health beyond our reproductive functions. But then in 1993, the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law. And what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities  be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institutes of Health. And in many ways, the law has worked. Women are now routinely  included in clinical studies, and we've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease. But remarkably, what we have learned about these  differences is often overlooked.So, we have to ask ourselves the question: Why leave women's health to chance? And we're leaving it to chance in two ways. The first is that there is so much more to learn and we're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent  of these sex differences. And the second is that we aren't  taking what we have learned, and routinely applying it in clinical care. We are just not doing enough.So, I'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have  impacted the health of women, and where we need to do more.Let's start with heart disease. It's the number one killer of women  in the United States today. This is the face of heart disease. Linda is a middle-aged woman, who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart. When she had recurring symptoms  she went back to her doctor. Her doctor did the gold standard test: a cardiac catheterization. It showed no blockages. Linda's symptoms continued. She had to stop working. And that's when she found us. When Linda came to us, we did  another cardiac catheterization and this time, we found clues. But we needed another test to make the diagnosis. So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound, where you use soundwaves to look at the artery from the inside out.And what we found was that Linda's disease didn't look like the typical male disease. The typical male disease looks like this. There's a discrete blockage or stenosis. Linda's disease, like the disease of so many women, looks like this. The plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely along the artery, and it's harder to see. So for Linda, and for so many women, the gold standard test wasn't gold.Now, Linda received the right treatment. She went back to her life and, fortunately, today she is doing well. But Linda was lucky. She found us, we found her disease.But for too many women, that's not the case. We have the tools. We have the technology to make the diagnosis. But it's all too often that these sex diffferences are overlooked.So what about treatment? A landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question: What are the most effective treatments  for heart disease in women? The authors looked at papers  written over a 10-year period, and hundreds had to be thrown out. And what they found out was that  of those that were tossed out, 65 percent were excluded because even though women  were included in the studies, the analysis didn't differentiate  between women and men. What a lost opportunity. The money had been spent and we didn't learn how women fared. And these studies could not contribute one iota to the very, very important question, what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women?I want to introduce you to  Hortense, my godmother, Hung Wei, a relative of a colleague, and somebody you may recognize \u2014 Dana, Christopher Reeve's wife. All three women have something  very important in common. All three were diagnosed with lung cancer, the number one cancer killer of women in the United States today. All three were nonsmokers. Sadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease. Today, what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers. Now interestingly, when women are  diagnosed with lung cancer, their survival tends to be better than that of men. Now, here are some clues. Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor  cells of both women and men. And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen. And when these genes are over-expressed, it's associated with improved survival only in young women. Now this is a very early finding and we don't yet know whether it has relevance to clinical care. But it's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity to save lives of both women and men.Now, let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences, it can drive the science. Several years ago a new lung cancer drug was being evaluated, and when the authors looked  at whose tumors shrank, they found that 82 percent were women. This led them to ask the question: Well, why? And what they found was that the genetic mutations  that the drug targeted were far more common in women. And what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer  that also includes sex.This is what we can accomplish when we don't leave women's health to chance. We know that when you invest in research, you get results. Take a look at the death rate  from breast cancer over time. And now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time. Now let's look at the dollars  invested in breast cancer \u2014 these are the dollars invested per death \u2014 and the dollars invested in lung cancer. Now, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results. They may not be fast enough, but it has produced results. We can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease.So let's go back to depression. Depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today. Our investigators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood. And when you put men and women in a functional MRI scanner \u2014 that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated \u2014 so you put them in the scanner  and you expose them to stress. You can actually see the difference. And it's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression.But even though we know that these differences occur, 66 percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified.So, I think we have to ask again the question: Why leave women's health to chance? And this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge  of being able to dramatically improve the health of women. We know that every cell has a sex. We know that these differences  are often overlooked. And therefore we know that women  are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today. We have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum.Women's health is an equal rights issue as important as equal pay. And it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine. (Applause) So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these  sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research. Or if we analyzed our data by sex.So, people often ask me: What can I do? And here's what I suggest: First, I suggest that you think about women's health in the same way that you think and care about other  causes that are important to you. And second, and equally as important, that as a woman, you have to ask your doctor and the doctors who are caring  for those who you love: Is this disease or treatment different in women? Now, this is a profound question  because the answer is likely yes, but your doctor may not know  the answer, at least not yet. But if you ask the question,  your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer. And this is so important, not only for ourselves, but for all of those whom we love. Whether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend or a grandmother.It was my grandmother's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of women. That's her legacy. Our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come.Thank you.

learn.\n\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.798\nToday, we know that women \nare 70 percent more likely\n\n00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.789\nto experience depression over their lifetimes\n\n00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.070\ncompared with men.\n\n00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.910\nAnd even with this high prevalence,\n\n00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.197\nwomen are misdiagnosed between \n30 and 50 percent of the time.\n\n00:02:05.197 --> 00:02:08.130\nNow we know that women are more likely\n\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.518\nto experience the symptoms \nof fatigue, sleep disturbance,\n\n00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:16.063\npain and anxiety compared with men.\n\n00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:18.762\nAnd these symptoms are often overlooked\n\n00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.725\nas symptoms of depression.\n\n00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:25.508\nAnd it isn't only depression in which \nthese sex differences occur,\n\n00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:30.027\nbut they occur across so many diseases.\n\n00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:32.022\nSo it's my grandmother's struggles\n\n00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:35.755\nthat have really led me on a lifelong quest.\n\n00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.983\nAnd today, I lead a center in which the mission\n\n00:02:38.983 --> 00:02:42.762\nis to discover why these sex differences occur\n\n00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.864\nand to use that knowledge\n\n00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.823\nto improve the health of women.\n\n00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:51.956\nToday, we know that every cell has a sex.\n\n00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:55.909\nNow, that's a term coined \nby the Institute of Medicine.\n\n00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.670\nAnd what it means is that \nmen and women are different\n\n00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.112\ndown to the cellular and molecular levels.\n\n00:03:04.112 --> 00:03:09.052\nIt means that we're different \nacross all of our organs.\n\n00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:14.547\nFrom our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.\n\n00:03:14.547 --> 00:03:18.431\nNow, it was only 20 years ago\n\n00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:22.258\nthat we hardly had any data on women's health\n\n00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:25.141\nbeyond our reproductive functions.\n\n00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:28.042\nBut then in 1993,\n\n00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:32.654\nthe NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.\n\n00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:35.257\nAnd what this law did was it mandated\n\n00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:39.730\nthat women and minorities \nbe included in clinical trials\n\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.781\nthat were funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:46.708\nAnd in many ways, the law has worked.\n\n00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:50.378\nWomen are now routinely \nincluded in clinical studies,\n\n00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:52.629\nand we've learned that there are major differences\n\n00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.722\nin the ways that women and men\n\n00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:57.258\nexperience disease.\n\n00:03:57.258 --> 00:03:59.423\nBut remarkably,\n\n00:03:59.423 --> 00:04:04.517\nwhat we have learned about these \ndifferences is often overlooked.\n\n00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:08.342\nSo, we have to ask ourselves the question:\n\n00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:12.855\nWhy leave women's health to chance?\n\n00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:15.498\nAnd we're leaving it to chance in two ways.\n\n00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:19.195\nThe first is that there is so much more to learn\n\n00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:21.604\nand we're not making the investment\n\n00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:25.772\nin fully understanding the extent \nof these sex differences.\n\n00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:30.494\nAnd the second is that we aren't \ntaking what we have learned,\n\n00:04:30.494 --> 00:04:34.198\nand routinely applying it in clinical care.\n\n00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:38.187\nWe are just not doing enough.\n\n00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:40.446\nSo, I'm going to share with you three examples\n\n00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:44.152\nof where sex differences have \nimpacted the health of women,\n\n00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:46.822\nand where we need to do more.\n\n00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:48.834\nLet's start with heart disease.\n\n00:04:48.834 --> 00:04:54.036\nIt's the number one killer of women \nin the United States today.\n\n00:04:54.036 --> 00:04:56.932\nThis is the face of heart disease.\n\n00:04:56.932 --> 00:04:59.213\nLinda is a middle-aged woman,\n\n00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:01.798\nwho had a stent placed in one of the arteries\n\n00:05:01.798 --> 00:05:03.898\ngoing to her heart.\n\n00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:07.149\nWhen she had recurring symptoms \nshe went back to her doctor.\n\n00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:09.787\nHer doctor did the gold standard test:\n\n00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:12.074\na cardiac catheterization.\n\n00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:14.491\nIt showed no blockages.\n\n00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:16.563\nLinda's symptoms continued.\n\n00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:19.036\nShe had to stop working.\n\n00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:21.788\nAnd that's when she found us.\n\n00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:25.936\nWhen Linda came to us, we did \nanother cardiac catheterization\n\n00:05:25.936 --> 00:05:29.353\nand this time, we found clues.\n\n00:05:29.353 --> 00:05:31.827\nBut we needed another test\n\n00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:34.421\nto make the diagnosis.\n\n00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:39.001\nSo we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound,\n\n00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:41.306\nwhere you use soundwaves to look at the artery\n\n00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:44.037\nfrom the inside out.\n\n00:05:44.037 --> 00:05:45.975\nAnd what we found\n\n00:05:45.975 --> 00:05:48.426\nwas that Linda's disease didn't look like\n\n00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:51.496\nthe typical male disease.\n\n00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:54.692\nThe typical male disease looks like this.\n\n00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:58.004\nThere's a discrete blockage or stenosis.\n\n00:05:58.004 --> 00:06:02.305\nLinda's disease, like the disease of so many women,\n\n00:06:02.305 --> 00:06:04.147\nlooks like this.\n\n00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:07.684\nThe plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely\n\n00:06:07.684 --> 00:06:11.656\nalong the artery, and it's harder to see.\n\n00:06:11.656 --> 00:06:15.062\nSo for Linda, and for so many women,\n\n00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:18.754\nthe gold standard test wasn't gold.\n\n00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:21.741\nNow, Linda received the right treatment.\n\n00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:23.919\nShe went back to her life and, fortunately, today\n\n00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.671\nshe is doing well.\n\n00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:27.277\nBut Linda was lucky.\n\n00:06:27.277 --> 00:06:29.903\nShe found us, we found her disease.\n\n00:06:29.903 --> 00:06:32.814\nBut for too many women, that's not the case.\n\n00:06:32.814 --> 00:06:35.129\nWe have the tools.\n\n00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.810\nWe have the technology to make the diagnosis.\n\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.207\nBut it's all too often that these sex diffferences\n\n00:06:42.207 --> 00:06:44.511\nare overlooked.\n\n00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:46.684\nSo what about treatment?\n\n00:06:46.684 --> 00:06:49.394\nA landmark study that was published two years ago\n\n00:06:49.394 --> 00:06:51.816\nasked the very important question:\n\n00:06:51.816 --> 00:06:56.871\nWhat are the most effective treatments \nfor heart disease in women?\n\n00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:00.530\nThe authors looked at papers \nwritten over a 10-year period,\n\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.008\nand hundreds had to be thrown out.\n\n00:07:03.008 --> 00:07:07.781\nAnd what they found out was that \nof those that were tossed out,\n\n00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:11.435\n65 percent were excluded\n\n00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:15.799\nbecause even though women \nwere included in the studies,\n\n00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:22.155\nthe analysis didn't differentiate \nbetween women and men.\n\n00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:25.376\nWhat a lost opportunity.\n\n00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:27.407\nThe money had been spent\n\n00:07:27.407 --> 00:07:29.554\nand we didn't learn how women fared.\n\n00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:32.355\nAnd these studies could not contribute one iota\n\n00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:34.772\nto the very, very important question,\n\n00:07:34.772 --> 00:07:37.163\nwhat are the most effective treatments\n\n00:07:37.163 --> 00:07:40.058\nfor heart disease in women?\n\n00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:45.550\nI want to introduce you to \nHortense, my godmother,\n\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.993\nHung Wei, a relative of a colleague,\n\n00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:51.184\nand somebody you may recognize --\n\n00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:54.831\nDana, Christopher Reeve's wife.\n\n00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:59.191\nAll three women have something \nvery important in common.\n\n00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:02.766\nAll three were diagnosed with lung cancer,\n\n00:08:02.766 --> 00:08:05.695\nthe number one cancer killer of women\n\n00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:08.396\nin the United States today.\n\n00:08:08.396 --> 00:08:12.272\nAll three were nonsmokers.\n\n00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:17.438\nSadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease.\n\n00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:23.578\nToday, what we know is that women who are\nnonsmokers are three times more likely\n\n00:08:23.578 --> 00:08:26.315\nto be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men\n\n00:08:26.315 --> 00:08:28.301\nwho are nonsmokers.\n\n00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:31.991\nNow interestingly, when women are \ndiagnosed with lung cancer,\n\n00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:35.170\ntheir survival tends to be better than that of men.\n\n00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.045\nNow, here are some clues.\n\n00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:39.444\nOur investigators have found that there are\n\n00:08:39.444 --> 00:08:44.116\ncertain genes in the lung tumor \ncells of both women and men.\n\n00:08:44.116 --> 00:08:46.308\nAnd these genes are activated\n\n00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:48.398\nmainly by estrogen.\n\n00:08:48.398 --> 00:08:51.216\nAnd when these genes are over-expressed,\n\n00:08:51.216 --> 00:08:53.947\nit's associated with improved survival\n\n00:08:53.947 --> 00:08:56.614\nonly in young women.\n\n00:08:56.614 --> 00:08:58.288\nNow this is a very early finding\n\n00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.931\nand we don't yet know whether it has relevance\n\n00:09:01.931 --> 00:09:04.372\nto clinical care.\n\n00:09:04.372 --> 00:09:08.231\nBut it's findings like this that may provide hope\n\n00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:10.998\nand may provide an opportunity to save lives\n\n00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:13.545\nof both women and men.\n\n00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:14.926\nNow, let me share with you an example\n\n00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:18.904\nof when we do consider sex differences,\nit can drive the science.\n\n00:09:18.904 --> 00:09:21.232\nSeveral years ago a new lung cancer drug\n\n00:09:21.232 --> 00:09:22.878\nwas being evaluated,\n\n00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:27.250\nand when the authors looked \nat whose tumors shrank,\n\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.683\nthey found that 82 percent were women.\n\n00:09:30.683 --> 00:09:33.646\nThis led them to ask the question: Well, why?\n\n00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:35.201\nAnd what they found\n\n00:09:35.201 --> 00:09:38.681\nwas that the genetic mutations \nthat the drug targeted\n\n00:09:38.681 --> 00:09:41.408\nwere far more common in women.\n\n00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:43.107\nAnd what this has led to\n\n00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:45.289\nis a more personalized approach\n\n00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:49.443\nto the treatment of lung cancer \nthat also includes sex.\n\n00:09:49.443 --> 00:09:51.538\nThis is what we can accomplish\n\n00:09:51.538 --> 00:09:55.364\nwhen we don't leave women's health to chance.\n\n00:09:55.364 --> 00:09:58.572\nWe know that when you invest in research,\n\n00:09:58.572 --> 00:10:00.098\nyou get results.\n\n00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:04.606\nTake a look at the death rate \nfrom breast cancer over time.\n\n00:10:04.606 --> 00:10:06.531\nAnd now take a look at the death rates\n\n00:10:06.531 --> 00:10:09.863\nfrom lung cancer in women over time.\n\n00:10:09.863 --> 00:10:13.473\nNow let's look at the dollars \ninvested in breast cancer --\n\n00:10:13.473 --> 00:10:16.442\nthese are the dollars invested per death --\n\n00:10:16.442 --> 00:10:20.670\nand the dollars invested in lung cancer.\n\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.591\nNow, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer\n\n00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.380\nhas produced results.\n\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.713\nThey may not be fast enough,\n\n00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.939\nbut it has produced results.\n\n00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:33.743\nWe can do the same\n\n00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:38.734\nfor lung cancer and for every other disease.\n\n00:10:38.734 --> 00:10:42.060\nSo let's go back to depression.\n\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.370\nDepression is the number one cause\n\n00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.962\nof disability in women in the world today.\n\n00:10:48.962 --> 00:10:51.097\nOur investigators have found\n\n00:10:51.097 --> 00:10:52.913\nthat there are differences in the brains\n\n00:10:52.913 --> 00:10:54.390\nof women and men\n\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.509\nin the areas that are connected with mood.\n\n00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:59.582\nAnd when you put men and women\n\n00:10:59.582 --> 00:11:01.457\nin a functional MRI scanner --\n\n00:11:01.457 --> 00:11:06.004\nthat's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated --\n\n00:11:06.004 --> 00:11:10.047\nso you put them in the scanner \nand you expose them to stress.\n\n00:11:10.047 --> 00:11:13.934\nYou can actually see the difference.\n\n00:11:13.934 --> 00:11:16.463\nAnd it's findings like this\n\n00:11:16.463 --> 00:11:19.444\nthat we believe hold some of the clues\n\n00:11:19.444 --> 00:11:23.197\nfor why we see these very significant sex differences\n\n00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:25.451\nin depression.\n\n00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.009\nBut even though we know\n\n00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:29.876\nthat these differences occur,\n\n00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:32.529\n66 percent\n\n00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:36.525\nof the brain research that begins in animals\n\n00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:38.851\nis done in either male animals\n\n00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:43.198\nor animals in whom the sex is not identified.\n\n00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:46.817\nSo, I think we have to ask again the question:\n\n00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:51.619\nWhy leave women's health to chance?\n\n00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:54.447\nAnd this is a question that haunts those of us\n\n00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.258\nin science and medicine\n\n00:11:56.258 --> 00:12:02.617\nwho believe that we are on the verge \nof being able to dramatically improve\n\n00:12:02.617 --> 00:12:04.293\nthe health of women.\n\n00:12:04.293 --> 00:12:06.779\nWe know that every cell has a sex.\n\n00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:09.721\nWe know that these differences \nare often overlooked.\n\n00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:14.009\nAnd therefore we know that women \nare not getting the full benefit\n\n00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:17.908\nof modern science and medicine today.\n\n00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:19.559\nWe have the tools\n\n00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:23.441\nbut we lack the collective will and momentum.\n\n00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:26.185\nWomen's health is an equal rights issue\n\n00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:29.739\nas important as equal pay.\n\n00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:31.923\nAnd it's an issue of the quality\n\n00:12:31.923 --> 00:12:35.078\nand the integrity of science and medicine.\n\n00:12:35.078 --> 00:12:42.541\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:47.086\nSo imagine the momentum we could achieve\n\n00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:49.197\nin advancing the health of women\n\n00:12:49.197 --> 00:12:52.056\nif we considered whether these \nsex differences were present\n\n00:12:52.056 --> 00:12:55.645\nat the very beginning of designing research.\n\n00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:59.524\nOr if we analyzed our data by sex.\n\n00:12:59.524 --> 00:13:01.472\nSo, people often ask me:\n\n00:13:01.472 --> 00:13:03.243\nWhat can I do?\n\n00:13:03.243 --> 00:13:05.577\nAnd here's what I suggest:\n\n00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:09.750\nFirst, I suggest that you think about women's health\n\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.493\nin the same way\n\n00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:17.538\nthat you think and care about other \ncauses that are important to you.\n\n00:13:17.538 --> 00:13:20.720\nAnd second, and equally as important,\n\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.932\nthat as a woman,\n\n00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:25.573\nyou have to ask your doctor\n\n00:13:25.573 --> 00:13:29.985\nand the doctors who are caring \nfor those who you love:\n\n00:13:29.985 --> 00:13:34.861\nIs this disease or treatment different in women?\n\n00:13:34.861 --> 00:13:38.449\nNow, this is a profound question \nbecause the answer is likely yes,\n\n00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:42.146\nbut your doctor may not know \nthe answer, at least not yet.\n\n00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:46.522\nBut if you ask the question, \nyour doctor will very likely\n\n00:13:46.522 --> 00:13:48.804\ngo looking for the answer.\n\n00:13:48.804 --> 00:13:51.141\nAnd this is so important,\n\n00:13:51.141 --> 00:13:53.303\nnot only for ourselves,\n\n00:13:53.303 --> 00:13:55.956\nbut for all of those whom we love.\n\n00:13:55.956 --> 00:14:00.440\nWhether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister,\n\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.137\na friend or a grandmother.\n\n00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:06.280\nIt was my grandmother's suffering\n\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.213\nthat inspired my work\n\n00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:11.198\nto improve the health of women.\n\n00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:13.548\nThat's her legacy.\n\n00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:18.217\nOur legacy can be to improve the health of women\n\n00:14:18.217 --> 00:14:20.356\nfor this generation\n\n00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:23.378\nand for generations to come.\n\n00:14:23.378 --> 00:14:25.527\nThank you.\n\n00:14:25.527 --> 00:14:28.809\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "As work gets more complex, 6 rules to simplify", "duration": "721", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/yves_morieux_as_work_gets_more_complex_6_rules_to_simplify", "transcript": "I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas: Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work? I have worked with more than 500 companies. Despite all the technological advances \u2014 computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications, the Internet. Enigma number two: Why is there so little engagement at work? Why do people feel so miserable, even actively disengaged? Disengaging their colleagues. Acting against the interest of their company. Despite all the affiliation events, the celebration, the people initiatives, the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams.At the beginning, I thought there was a chicken and egg issue: Because people are less engaged,  they are less productive. Or vice versa, because they are less productive, we put more pressure and they are less engaged. But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates, in fact, to the basic  pillars of management. The way we organize is based on two pillars. The hard \u2014 structure, processes, systems. The soft \u2014 feelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships, traits, personality. And whenever a company reorganizes, restructures, reengineers, goes through a cultural transformation program, it chooses these two pillars. Now, we try to refine them, we try to combine them. The real issue is \u2014 and this is the answer to the two enigmas \u2014 these pillars are obsolete. Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination. They are obsolete. How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business? The hard approach, basically  is that you start from strategy, requirements, structures, processes,  systems, KPIs, scorecards, committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters, you name it. I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees,  middle offices and interfaces. What happens basically on the left, you have more complexity, the  new complexity of business. We need quality, cost, reliability, speed. And every time there is a new requirement, we use the same approach. We create dedicated structure processed systems, basically to deal with the  new complexity of business. The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization.Let's take an example. An automotive company, the engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix. If you open any cell of the matrix, you find another 20-dimensional matrix. You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption, Mr. Anti-Collision Properties. For any new requirement, you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement. What happens when the new  requirement emerges? Some years ago, a new requirement appeared on the marketplace: the length of the warranty period. So therefore the new requirement is repairability, making cars easy to repair. Otherwise when you bring the car  to the garage to fix the light, if you have to remove the engine to access the lights, the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours, and the  warranty budget will explode. So, what was the solution using the hard approach? If repairability is the new requirement, the solution is to create a new function, Mr. Repairability. And Mr. Repairability creates  the repairability process. With a repairability scorecard,  with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive. That came on top of 25 other KPIs. What percentage of these people is variable compensation? Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs, repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent. What difference did it make in their actions, their choices to simplify? Zero. But what occurs for zero impact?  Mr. Repairability, process, scorecard, evaluation, coordination  with the 25 other coordinators to have zero impact.Now, in front of the new complexity of business, the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines. It is basically the interplay. How the parts work together. The connections, the interactions, the synapses. It is not the skeleton of boxes,  it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence. You know, you could call it cooperation, basically. Whenever people cooperate, they use less resources. In everything. You know, the repairability issue is a cooperation problem. When you design cars, please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages. When we don't cooperate we need more time, more equipment, more systems, more teams. We need \u2014 When procurement, supply  chain, manufacturing don't cooperate we need more stock, more inventories,  more working capital. Who will pay for that? Shareholders? Customers? No, they will refuse. So who is left?  The employees, who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation. Stress, burnout, they are  overwhelmed, accidents. No wonder they disengage. How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation? The hard: In banks, when there is a problem between the back office and the front office, they don't cooperate. What is the solution? They create a middle office. What happens one year later? Instead of one problem  between the back and the front, now I have two problems. Between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front. Plus I have to pay for the middle office. The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation. It can only add new boxes,  new bones in the skeleton.The soft approach: To make people cooperate, we need  to make them like each other. Improve interpersonal feelings, the more people like each other,  the more they will cooperate. It is totally wrong. It is even counterproductive. Look, at home I have two TVs. Why? Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife. (Laughter) Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife. And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife. If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough: You will watch my favorite football game, if you are not happy, how is the book or the door? (Laughter) The more we like each other, the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships  by imposing tough tradeoffs. And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration. Definitely, these approaches are obsolete.To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system, we have created what we call  the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules. Simple rule number one: Understand what others do. What is their real work? We need to go beyond the boxes, the job descriptions, beyond the surface of the container, to understand the real content. Me, designer, if I put a wire here, I know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights. Second, you need to reenforce integrators. Integrators are not middle  offices, they are managers, existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate. How can you reinforce your  managers as integrators? By removing layers. When there are too many layers people are too far from the action, therefore they need KPIs, metrics, they need poor proxies for reality. They don't understand reality and they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs. By removing rules \u2014 the bigger we are, the more we need integrators, therefore the less rules we must have, to give discretionary power to managers. And we do the opposite \u2014 the bigger we are, the more rules we create. And we end up with the Encyclopedia  Britannica of rules. You need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment, their intelligence. You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate, to move out of insulation. Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage. These rules, they come from game theory and organizational sociology. You can increase the shadow of the future. Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions. This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact. They said to the design engineers: Now, in three years, when the new  car is launched on the market, you will move to the after sales  network, and become in charge of the warranty budget, and if the warranty budget explodes, it will explode in your face. (Laughter) Much more powerful than 0.8  percent variable compensation. You need also to increase reciprocity, by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient. When you remove these buffers, you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear. We will cooperate. Remove the second TV. There are many second TVs at work that don't create value, they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency. You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate. The CEO of The Lego Group, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it. He says, blame is not for failure, it is for failing to help or ask for help. It changes everything. Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses, my real forecast, because I know I will not be blamed if I fail, but if I fail to help or ask for help. When you do this, it has a lot of implications on organizational design. You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines; you look at their interplay. It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use. On human resource management practices. When you do that, you can manage complexity, the new complexity of business, without getting complicated. You create more value with lower cost. You simultaneously improve  performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both. Complicatedness: This is your  battle, business leaders. The real battle is not against competitors. This is rubbish, very abstract. When do we meet competitors to fight them? The real battle is against ourselves, against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness. Only you can fight, can do it. Thank you.

division\n\n00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:01.444\nis a five-dimensional matrix.\n\n00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:03.476\nIf you open any cell of the matrix,\n\n00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:06.489\nyou find another 20-dimensional matrix.\n\n00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.352\nYou have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,\n\n00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:11.310\nMr. Anti-Collision Properties.\n\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.140\nFor any new requirement,\n\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.015\nyou have a dedicated function\n\n00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:17.804\nin charge of aligning engineers against\n\n00:03:17.804 --> 00:03:19.352\nthe new requirement.\n\n00:03:19.352 --> 00:03:21.951\nWhat happens when the new \nrequirement emerges?\n\n00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.043\nSome years ago, a new requirement\n\n00:03:24.043 --> 00:03:25.890\nappeared on the marketplace:\n\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.041\nthe length of the warranty period.\n\n00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.976\nSo therefore the new requirement is repairability,\n\n00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:32.476\nmaking cars easy to repair.\n\n00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:36.482\nOtherwise when you bring the car \nto the garage to fix the light,\n\n00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.739\nif you have to remove the engine\n\n00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.068\nto access the lights,\n\n00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:42.507\nthe car will have to stay one week in the garage\n\n00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:45.394\ninstead of two hours, and the \nwarranty budget will explode.\n\n00:03:45.394 --> 00:03:48.339\nSo, what was the solution using the hard approach?\n\n00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:51.389\nIf repairability is the new requirement,\n\n00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.478\nthe solution is to create a new function,\n\n00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:55.651\nMr.

I've always had stage fright, and not just a little bit, it's a big bit. And it didn't even matter until I was 27. That's when I started writing songs, and even then I only played them for myself. Just knowing my roommates were in the  same house made me uncomfortable.But after a couple of years,  just writing songs wasn't enough. I had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people, but physiologically, I couldn't do it. I had this irrational fear. But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced, the more I wanted to perform.So on the week of my 30th birthday, I decided I was going to go to this local open mic, and put this fear behind me. Well, when I got there, it was packed. There were like 20 people there. (Laughter) And they all looked angry. But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play, and I felt pretty good.Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn, when my whole body rebelled, and  this wave of anxiety just washed over me. Now, when you experience fear,  your sympathetic nervous system kicks in. So you have a rush of adrenaline,  your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster. Next your non-essential systems start  to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter) So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore. Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your Spidey sense tingles, basically your whole body is trigger-happy. (Laughter) That condition is not conducive  to performing folk music. (Laughter) I mean, your nervous system is an idiot. Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic? (Laughter) I have never been more terrified \u2014 until now. (Laughter and cheers)So then it was my turn, and somehow, I get myself onto  the stage, I start my song, I open my mouth to sing the first line, and this completely horrible vibrato \u2014 you know, when your voice wavers \u2014  comes streaming out. And this is not the good kind of vibrato,  like an opera singer has, this is my whole body just convulsing with fear. I mean, it's a nightmare. I'm embarrassed, the audience  is clearly uncomfortable, they're focused on my discomfort. It was so bad. But that was my first real experience  as a solo singer-songwriter.And something good did happen \u2014 I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for. And I wanted more. But I knew  I had to get past this nervousness.That night I promised myself:  I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore. And I did. I went back every single week, and sure enough, week after week, it didn't get any better. The same  thing happened every week. (Laughter) I couldn't shake it.And that's when I had an epiphany. And I remember it really well, because I  don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter) All I had to do was write a song  that exploits my nervousness. That only seems authentic when I have stage fright, and the more nervous I was, the better the song would be. Easy. So I started writing a song about having stage fright. First, fessing up to the problem, the physical manifestations, how I would feel, how the listener might feel. And then accounting for things like my shaky voice, and I knew I would be singing about a  half-octave higher than normal, because I was nervous. By having a song that explained  what was happening to me, while it was happening, that gave the audience permission to think about it. They didn't have to feel bad  for me because I was nervous, they could experience that with me, and we were all one big happy, nervous,  uncomfortable family. (Laughter)By thinking about my audience,  by embracing and exploiting my problem, I was able to take something  that was blocking my progress, and turn it into something that  was essential for my success. And having the stage fright song let  me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance. And then I could move on,  and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease. And eventually, over time, I didn't  have to play the stage fright song at all. Except for when I was really  nervous, like now. (Laughter)Would it be okay if I played the  stage fright song for you? (Applause)Can I have a sip of water? (Music) Thank you.\u266b I'm not joking, you know, \u266b \u266b this stage fright is real. \u266b \u266b And if I'm up here trembling and singing, \u266b \u266b well, you'll know how I feel. \u266b \u266b And the mistake I'd be making, \u266b \u266b the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. \u266b \u266b As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, \u266b \u266b well, you don't have to be. \u266b \u266b Well, maybe just a little bit. \u266b (Laughter) \u266b And maybe I'll try to imagine  you all without clothes. \u266b \u266b But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows. \u266b \u266b Not to discuss this at length, \u266b \u266b but my body image was never my strength. \u266b \u266b So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, \u266b \u266b I mean, you're not even really naked. \u266b \u266b And I'm the one with the problem. \u266b \u266b And you tell me, don't worry  so much, you'll be great. \u266b \u266b But I'm the one living with me \u266b \u266b and I know how I get. \u266b \u266b Your advice is gentle but late. \u266b \u266b If not just a bit patronizing. \u266b \u266b And that sarcastic tone doesn't  help me when I sing. \u266b \u266b But we shouldn't talk about  these things right now, \u266b \u266b really, I'm up on stage, and  you're in the crowd. Hi. \u266b \u266b And I'm not making fun of  unnurtured, irrational fear, \u266b \u266b and if I wasn't ready to face this, \u266b \u266b I sure as hell wouldn't be here. \u266b \u266b But if I belt one note out clearly, \u266b \u266b you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. \u266b \u266b And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' \u266b \u266b my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. \u266b \u266b But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', \u266b \u266b my vocal cords movin', \u266b \u266b at speeds slightly faster than sound. \u266b (Applause)", "id": 1912, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:14.032\nJoe Kowan: I have stage fright.\n\n00:00:14.032 --> 00:00:15.525\nI've always had stage fright,\n\n00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.353\nand not just a little bit,\n\n00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:19.144\nit's a big bit.\n\n00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.937\nAnd it didn't even matter until I was 27.\n\n00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:24.495\nThat's when I started writing songs, and even then\n\n00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.297\nI only played them for myself.\n\n00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.042\nJust knowing my roommates were in the \nsame house made me uncomfortable.\n\n00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:32.849\nBut after a couple of years, \njust writing songs wasn't enough.\n\n00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:35.868\nI had all these stories and ideas,\nand I wanted to share them with people,\n\n00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:39.174\nbut physiologically, I couldn't do it.\n\n00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:42.100\nI had this irrational fear.\n\n00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.259\nBut the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,\n\n00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:45.449\nthe more I wanted to perform.\n\n00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.506\nSo on the week of my 30th birthday,\n\n00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.459\nI decided I was going to go to this local open mic,\n\n00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:52.174\nand put this fear behind me.\n\n00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:55.031\nWell, when I got there, it was packed.\n\n00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:57.005\nThere were like 20 people there.\n\n00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:58.888\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:01.495\nAnd they all looked angry.\n\n00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:05.096\nBut I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,\n\n00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:06.588\nand I felt pretty good.\n\n00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.649\nPretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,\n\n00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.113\nwhen my whole body rebelled, and \nthis wave of anxiety just washed over me.\n\n00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:18.668\nNow, when you experience fear, \nyour sympathetic nervous system kicks in.\n\n00:01:18.668 --> 00:01:21.511\nSo you have a rush of adrenaline, \nyour heart rate increases,\n\n00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:22.964\nyour breathing gets faster.\n\n00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:29.136\nNext your non-essential systems start \nto shut down, like digestion.

I went back every single week,\n\n00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:08.688\nand sure enough, week after week,\n\n00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.858\nit didn't get any better. The same \nthing happened every week.

(Laughter)\n\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.119\nAll I had to do was write a song \nthat exploits my nervousness.\n\n00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.241\nThat only seems authentic when I have stage fright,\n\n00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.529\nand the more nervous I was,\n\n00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.118\nthe better the song would be. Easy.\n\n00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:36.947\nSo I started writing a song about having stage fright.\n\n00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:39.008\nFirst, fessing up to the problem,\n\n00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:40.836\nthe physical manifestations, how I would feel,\n\n00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:42.265\nhow the listener might feel.\n\n00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:44.873\nAnd then accounting for things like my shaky voice,\n\n00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:47.805\nand I knew I would be singing about a \nhalf-octave higher than normal,\n\n00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:49.919\nbecause I was nervous.\n\n00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.991\nBy having a song that explained \nwhat was happening to me,\n\n00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.478\nwhile it was happening,\n\n00:03:54.478 --> 00:03:56.341\nthat gave the audience permission to think about it.\n\n00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:59.102\nThey didn't have to feel bad \nfor me because I was nervous,\n\n00:03:59.102 --> 00:04:00.820\nthey could experience that with me,\n\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.069\nand we were all one big happy, nervous, \nuncomfortable family. (Laughter)\n\n00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.878\nBy thinking about my audience, \nby embracing and exploiting my problem,\n\n00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:13.813\nI was able to take something \nthat was blocking my progress,\n\n00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:17.750\nand turn it into something that \nwas essential for my success.\n\n00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.770\nAnd having the stage fright song let \nme get past that biggest issue\n\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.588\nright in the beginning of a performance.\n\n00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:24.132\nAnd then I could move on, \nand play the rest of my songs\n\n00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:27.386\nwith just a little bit more ease.\n\n00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:33.662\nAnd eventually, over time, I didn't \nhave to play the stage fright song at all.\n\n00:04:33.662 --> 00:04:39.382\nExcept for when I was really \nnervous, like now. (Laughter)\n\n00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:43.628\nWould it be okay if I played the \nstage fright song for you?\n\n00:04:43.628 --> 00:04:48.620\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:55.673\nCan I have a sip of water?\n\n00:04:55.673 --> 00:04:59.624\n(Music)\n\n00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.478\nThank you.\n\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.321\n\u266b I'm not joking, you know, \u266b\n\n00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:15.949\n\u266b this stage fright is real. \u266b\n\n00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.160\n\u266b And if I'm up here trembling and singing, \u266b\n\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.506\n\u266b well, you'll know how I feel. \u266b\n\n00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:27.426\n\u266b And the mistake I'd be making, \u266b\n\n00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:31.354\n\u266b the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. \u266b\n\n00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:34.821\n\u266b As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, \u266b\n\n00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:37.867\n\u266b well, you don't have to be. \u266b\n\n00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:40.382\n\u266b Well, maybe just a little bit. \u266b\n\n00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.783\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:49.662\n\u266b And maybe I'll try to imagine \nyou all without clothes. \u266b\n\n00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:57.535\n\u266b But singing in front of all naked strangers\nscares me more than anyone knows. \u266b\n\n00:05:57.535 --> 00:06:01.488\n\u266b Not to discuss this at length, \u266b\n\n00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:06.733\n\u266b but my body image was never my strength. \u266b\n\n00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:10.271\n\u266b So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, \u266b\n\n00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:15.161\n\u266b I mean, you're not even really naked. \u266b\n\n00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:18.504\n\u266b And I'm the one with the problem. \u266b\n\n00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:25.772\n\u266b And you tell me, don't worry \nso much, you'll be great. \u266b\n\n00:06:25.772 --> 00:06:28.576\n\u266b But I'm the one living with me \u266b\n\n00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:30.894\n\u266b and I know how I get. \u266b\n\n00:06:30.894 --> 00:06:35.038\n\u266b Your advice is gentle but late. \u266b\n\n00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:38.487\n\u266b If not just a bit patronizing. \u266b\n\n00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:43.319\n\u266b And that sarcastic tone doesn't \nhelp me when I sing. \u266b\n\n00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.207\n\u266b But we shouldn't talk about \nthese things right now, \u266b\n\n00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:54.094\n\u266b really, I'm up on stage, and \nyou're in the crowd.

The last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word. It starts with an M. MOOC: massive open online courses. Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world, in the millions, for free. Anybody who has an Internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it. Now, in this discussion today, I'm going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs. We are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom.Now, our classrooms could use change. So, here's a classroom at this little three-letter institute in the Northeast of America, MIT. And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago, and this is a classroom today. What's changed? The seats are in color. Whoop-de-do. Education really hasn't changed in the past 500 years. The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks. Everything else has changed around us. You know, from healthcare to transportation, everything is different, but education hasn't changed.It's also been a real issue in terms of access. So what you see here is not a rock concert. And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna. This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. Now, we've all heard of distance education, but the students way in the back, 200 feet away from the instructor, I think they are undergoing long-distance education. Now, I really believe that we can transform education, both in quality and scale and access, through technology. For example, at edX, we are trying to transform education through online technologies. Given education has been calcified for 500 years, we really cannot think about reengineering it, micromanaging it. We really have to completely reimagine it. It's like going from ox carts to the airplane. Even the infrastructure has to change. Everything has to change. We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises, online videos. We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification. We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards. Everything really has to change.So at edX and a number of other organizations, we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education. And you heard of this example, where, when we launched our very first course \u2014 and this was an MIT-hard circuits and electronics course \u2014 about a year and a half ago, 155,000 students from 162 countries enrolled in this course. And we had no marketing budget. Now, 155,000 is a big number. This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its 150-year history. 7,200 students passed the course, and this was a hard course. 7,200 is also a big number. If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year, I would have to teach for 40 years before I could teach this many students.Now these large numbers are just one part of the story. So today, I want to discuss a different aspect, the other side of MOOCs, take a different perspective. We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom, to create a blended model of learning.But before I go into that, let me tell you a story. When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager, she stopped speaking English, and she began speaking this new language. I call it teen-lish. It's a digital language. It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.\"Honey, come over for dinner.\"\"Hmm.\"\"Did you hear me?\"Silence. (Laughter)\"Can you listen to me?\"\"Hmm.\"So we had a real issue with communicating, and we were just not communicating, until one day I had this epiphany. I texted her. (Laughter) I got an instant response. I said, no, that must have been by accident. She must have thought, you know, some friend of hers was calling her. So I texted her again. Boom, another response. I said, this is great. And so since then, our life has changed. I text her, she responds. It's just been absolutely great. (Applause)So our millennial generation is built differently. Now, I'm older, and my youthful looks might belie that, but I'm not in the millennial generation. But our kids are really different. The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology. So why are we fighting it in the classroom? Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it. In fact, I believe \u2014 and I have two fat thumbs, I can't text very well \u2014 but I'm willing to bet that with evolution, our kids and their grandchildren will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs to text much better, that evolution will fix all of that stuff. But what if we embraced technology, embraced the millennial generation's natural predilections, and really think about creating these online technologies, blend them into their lives. So here's what we can do. So rather than driving our kids into a classroom, herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning \u2014 I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning, so why are we forcing our kids to do that? So instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom, in the dining room, in the bathroom, wherever they're most creative. Then they come into the classroom for some in-person interaction. They can have discussions amongst themselves. They can solve problems together. They can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions. In fact, with edX, when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world, this was happening unbeknownst to us. Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom, and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises, where the learners in the high school, 15-year-olds, mind you, would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class, and as you see from this image here, they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work. And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog.We were also doing other pilots. So we did a pilot experimental blended courses, working with San Jose State University in California, again, with the circuits and electronics course. You'll hear that a lot. That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning. So there, the students would, again, the instructors flipped the classroom, blended online and in person, and the results were staggering. Now don't take these results to the bank just yet. Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more, but the early results are incredible. So traditionally, semester upon semester, for the past several years, this course, again, a hard course, had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent every semester. With this blended class late last year, the failure rate fell to nine percent. So the results can be extremely, extremely good.Now before we go too far into this, I'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas. What are some key ideas that makes all of this work?One idea is active learning. The idea here is, rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures, we replace this with what we call lessons. Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises. So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise. Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education. You teach by asking questions. And this is a form of learning called active learning, and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972, by Craik and Lockhart, where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing. Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material.The second idea is self-pacing. Now, when I went to a lecture hall, and if you were like me, by the fifth minute I would lose the professor. I wasn't all that smart, and I would be scrambling, taking notes, and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour. Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies, we offer videos and interactive engagements to students? They can hit the pause button. They can rewind the professor. Heck, they can even mute the professor. So this form of self-pacing can be very helpful to learning.The third idea that we have is instant feedback. With instant feedback, the computer grades exercises. I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students? Your computer is grading all the exercises. And we've all submitted homeworks, and your grades come back two weeks later, you've forgotten all about it. I don't think I've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days. Some are never graded. So with instant feedback, students can try to apply answers. If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback. They can try it again and try it again, and this really becomes much more engaging. They get the instant feedback, and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX. Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark. In fact, one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year, he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year, and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark: \"Oh god; have I missed you.\" When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework? My colleague Ed Bertschinger, who heads up the physics department at MIT, has this to say about instant feedback: He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes.The next big idea is gamification. You know, all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on. You know, they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it. So we applied these gamification techniques to learning, and we can build these online laboratories. How do you teach creativity? How do you teach design? We can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs. So as this little video shows here, you can engage students much like they design with Legos. So here, the learners are building a circuit with Lego-like ease. And this can also be graded by the computer.Fifth is peer learning. So here, we use discussion forums and discussions and Facebook-like interaction not as a distraction, but to really help students learn. Let me tell you a story. When we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students, I didn't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course. I told my TAs, okay, 24/7, we're going to be up monitoring the forum, answering questions. They had answered questions for 100 students. How do you do that for 150,000? So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night, and I think there's this question from a student from Pakistan, and he asked a question, and I said, okay, let me go and type up an answer, I don't type all that fast, and I begin typing up the answer, and before I can finish, another student from Egypt popped in with an answer, not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer, and before I can finish, a student from the U.S. had popped in with a different answer. And then I sat back, fascinated. Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were discussing and interacting with each other, and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated, having this epiphany, and by 4 a.m. in the morning, they had discovered the right answer. And all I had to do was go and bless it, \"Good answer.\" So this is absolutely amazing, where students are learning from each other, and they're telling us that they are learning by teaching.Now this is all not just in the future. This is happening today. So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and  high schools around the world, from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California \u2014 all over the world. And these kinds of technologies really help, the blended model can really help revolutionize education. It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs, the business aspect. We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities, and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs, where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next-generation textbook. They can use as much or as little as they like, and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.Finally, I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit. I would like us to really reimagine education. We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces. We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars. The Aakash is 40 dollars. We have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings to digital dormitories.But I think at the end of the day, I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities. Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and, you know, you didn't even have a rewind button?Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.

today,\n\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.945\nI'm going to focus\n\n00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:51.213\non a different aspect of MOOCs.\n\n00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:53.564\nWe are taking what we are learning\n\n00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:56.129\nand the technologies we are developing in the large\n\n00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.229\nand applying them in the small\n\n00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.208\nto create a blended model of education\n\n00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:03.001\nto really reinvent and reimagine\n\n00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.428\nwhat we do in the classroom.\n\n00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:07.938\nNow, our classrooms could use change.\n\n00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:10.359\nSo, here's a classroom\n\n00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.384\nat this little three-letter institute\n\n00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:15.168\nin the Northeast of America, MIT.\n\n00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:17.487\nAnd this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,\n\n00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:20.954\nand this is a classroom today.\n\n00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:24.074\nWhat's changed?\n\n00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:26.621\nThe seats are in color.\n\n00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.749\nWhoop-de-do.\n\n00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.460\nEducation really hasn't changed\n\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.155\nin the past 500 years.\n\n00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:36.486\nThe last big innovation in education\n\n00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:39.968\nwas the printing press and the textbooks.\n\n00:01:39.968 --> 00:01:41.378\nEverything else has changed around us.\n\n00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:43.201\nYou know, from healthcare to transportation,\n\n00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.694\neverything is different,\nbut education hasn't changed.\n\n00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:50.367\nIt's also been a real issue in terms of access.\n\n00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.994\nSo what you see here\n\n00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:54.496\nis not a rock concert.\n\n00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:57.042\nAnd the person you see at the end of the stage\n\n00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.102\nis not Madonna.\n\n00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:00.731\nThis is a classroom\n\n00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:05.149\nat the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.\n\n00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.085\nNow, we've all heard of distance education,\n\n00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:10.453\nbut the students way in the back,\n\n00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:12.565\n200 feet away from the instructor,\n\n00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:17.460\nI think they are undergoing long-distance education.\n\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.135\nNow, I really believe\n\n00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:21.350\nthat we can transform education,\n\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.196\nboth in quality and scale and access,\n\n00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:26.504\nthrough technology.\n\n00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:30.199\nFor example, at edX,\n\n00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.452\nwe are trying to transform education\n\n00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:35.612\nthrough online technologies.\n\n00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:38.871\nGiven education has been calcified for 500 years,\n\n00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.062\nwe really cannot think about reengineering it,\n\n00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.207\nmicromanaging it.\n\n00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:44.515\nWe really have to completely reimagine it.\n\n00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:48.556\nIt's like going from ox carts to the airplane.\n\n00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.079\nEven the infrastructure has to change.\n\n00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.692\nEverything has to change.\n\n00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:55.057\nWe need to go from lectures on the blackboard\n\n00:02:55.057 --> 00:02:57.665\nto online exercises, online videos.\n\n00:02:57.665 --> 00:03:00.146\nWe have to go to interactive virtual laboratories\n\n00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.795\nand gamification.\n\n00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:03.706\nWe have to go to completely online grading\n\n00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:06.459\nand peer interaction and discussion boards.\n\n00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.740\nEverything really has to change.\n\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.246\nSo at edX and a number of other organizations,\n\n00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:13.405\nwe are applying these technologies to education\n\n00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:16.591\nthrough MOOCs to really\nincrease access to education.\n\n00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:18.308\nAnd you heard of this example,\n\n00:03:18.308 --> 00:03:20.924\nwhere, when we launched our very first course --\n\n00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:22.690\nand this was an MIT-hard\n\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.278\ncircuits and electronics course --\n\n00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:26.972\nabout a year and a half ago,\n\n00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:32.275\n155,000 students from 162 countries\n\n00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:33.978\nenrolled in this course.\n\n00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:36.664\nAnd we had no marketing budget.\n\n00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:40.152\nNow, 155,000 is a big number.\n\n00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:41.891\nThis number is bigger\n\n00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.522\nthan the total number of alumni of MIT\n\n00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:48.347\nin its 150-year history.\n\n00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:50.505\n7,200 students passed the course,\n\n00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:52.968\nand this was a hard course.\n\n00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:56.422\n7,200 is also a big number.\n\n00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:59.964\nIf I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,\n\n00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:02.841\nI would have to teach for 40 years\n\n00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:05.443\nbefore I could teach this many students.\n\n00:04:05.443 --> 00:04:06.981\nNow these large numbers\n\n00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:09.139\nare just one part of the story.\n\n00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.801\nSo today, I want to discuss a different aspect,\n\n00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.026\nthe other side of MOOCs,\n\n00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:15.205\ntake a different perspective.\n\n00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:18.140\nWe are taking what we develop\nand learn in the large\n\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.685\nand applying it in the small\n\n00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:23.681\nto the classroom, to create\na blended model of learning.\n\n00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:28.284\nBut before I go into that, let me tell you a story.\n\n00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:32.368\nWhen my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,\n\n00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:35.735\nshe stopped speaking English,\n\n00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:38.796\nand she began speaking this new language.\n\n00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:41.602\nI call it teen-lish.\n\n00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:43.814\nIt's a digital language.\n\n00:04:43.814 --> 00:04:50.528\nIt's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.\n\n00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:53.844\n\"Honey, come over for dinner.\"\n\n00:04:53.844 --> 00:04:55.439\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.573\n\"Did you hear me?\"\n\n00:04:57.573 --> 00:04:59.836\nSilence. (Laughter)\n\n00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:01.208\n\"Can you listen to me?\"\n\n00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:02.580\n&amp;quot;Hmm.&amp;quot;\n\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.536\nSo we had a real issue with communicating,\n\n00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:06.804\nand we were just not communicating,\n\n00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:09.818\nuntil one day I had this epiphany.\n\n00:05:09.818 --> 00:05:12.481\nI texted her. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:14.799\nI got an instant response.\n\n00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:16.484\nI said, no, that must have been by accident.\n\n00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:17.571\nShe must have thought, you know,\n\n00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:19.858\nsome friend of hers was calling her.\n\n00:05:19.858 --> 00:05:22.955\nSo I texted her again. Boom, another response.\n\n00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.764\nI said, this is great.\n\n00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:26.820\nAnd so since then, our life has changed.\n\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.378\nI text her, she responds.\n\n00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:30.880\nIt's just been absolutely great.\n\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.735\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.705\nSo our millennial generation\n\n00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.339\nis built differently.\n\n00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.840\nNow, I'm older, and my\nyouthful looks might belie that,\n\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.696\nbut I'm not in the millennial generation.\n\n00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:48.328\nBut our kids are really different.\n\n00:05:48.328 --> 00:05:50.187\nThe millennial generation is completely comfortable\n\n00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:51.427\nwith online technology.\n\n00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:53.456\nSo why are we fighting it in the classroom?\n\n00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:55.089\nLet's not fight it. Let's embrace it.\n\n00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.778\nIn fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs,\n\n00:05:56.778 --> 00:05:58.427\nI can't text very well --\n\n00:05:58.427 --> 00:06:00.594\nbut I'm willing to bet that with evolution,\n\n00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:02.839\nour kids and their grandchildren\n\n00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.669\nwill develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs\n\n00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.052\nto text much better,\n\n00:06:06.052 --> 00:06:08.912\nthat evolution will fix all of that stuff.\n\n00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:10.683\nBut what if we embraced technology,\n\n00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:13.287\nembraced the millennial generation's\n\n00:06:13.287 --> 00:06:14.552\nnatural predilections,\n\n00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:17.597\nand really think about creating\nthese online technologies,\n\n00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:19.031\nblend them into their lives.\n\n00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:20.854\nSo here's what we can do.\n\n00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:23.346\nSo rather than driving our kids into a classroom,\n\n00:06:23.346 --> 00:06:25.918\nherding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning --\n\n00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:28.676\nI hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,\n\n00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:30.758\nso why are we forcing our kids to do that?\n\n00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:31.932\nSo instead what you do\n\n00:06:31.932 --> 00:06:33.952\nis you have them watch videos\n\n00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:35.763\nand do interactive exercises\n\n00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:38.452\nin the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,\n\n00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:40.313\nin the dining room, in the bathroom,\n\n00:06:40.313 --> 00:06:42.890\nwherever they're most creative.\n\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.885\nThen they come into the classroom\n\n00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:48.309\nfor some in-person interaction.\n\n00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:50.146\nThey can have discussions amongst themselves.\n\n00:06:50.146 --> 00:06:51.722\nThey can solve problems together.\n\n00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:52.868\nThey can work with the professor\n\n00:06:52.868 --> 00:06:55.862\nand have the professor answer their questions.\n\n00:06:55.862 --> 00:06:59.725\nIn fact, with edX, when we\nwere teaching our first course\n\n00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.151\non circuits and electronics around the world,\n\n00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:04.530\nthis was happening unbeknownst to us.\n\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.069\nTwo high school teachers\n\n00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.751\nat the Sant High School in Mongolia\n\n00:07:09.751 --> 00:07:11.898\nhad flipped their classroom,\n\n00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:14.177\nand they were using our video lectures\n\n00:07:14.177 --> 00:07:16.050\nand interactive exercises,\n\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.661\nwhere the learners in the high school,\n\n00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:19.246\n15-year-olds, mind you,\n\n00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:21.080\nwould go and do these things in their own homes\n\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.427\nand they would come into class,\n\n00:07:22.427 --> 00:07:24.363\nand as you see from this image here,\n\n00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:25.449\nthey would interact with each other\n\n00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.786\nand do some physical laboratory work.\n\n00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:29.107\nAnd the only way we discovered this\n\n00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:30.530\nwas they wrote a blog\n\n00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.553\nand we happened to stumble upon that blog.\n\n00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:36.660\nWe were also doing other pilots.\n\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.142\nSo we did a pilot experimental blended courses,\n\n00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:42.114\nworking with San Jose State University in California,\n\n00:07:42.114 --> 00:07:43.961\nagain, with the circuits and electronics course.\n\n00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:46.429\nYou'll hear that a lot. That course has become\n\n00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:49.905\nsort of like our petri dish of learning.\n\n00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:52.173\nSo there, the students would, again,\n\n00:07:52.173 --> 00:07:54.900\nthe instructors flipped the classroom,\n\n00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.621\nblended online and in person,\n\n00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:58.929\nand the results were staggering.\n\n00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:01.571\nNow don't take these results to the bank just yet.\n\n00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:04.059\nJust wait a little bit longer as we\nexperiment with this some more,\n\n00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:06.220\nbut the early results are incredible.\n\n00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.617\nSo traditionally, semester upon semester,\n\n00:08:08.617 --> 00:08:10.958\nfor the past several years, this course,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.647\nagain, a hard course,\n\n00:08:12.647 --> 00:08:15.763\nhad a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent\n\n00:08:15.763 --> 00:08:17.263\nevery semester.\n\n00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:19.961\nWith this blended class late last year,\n\n00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:23.942\nthe failure rate fell to nine percent.\n\n00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:27.705\nSo the results can be extremely, extremely good.\n\n00:08:27.705 --> 00:08:30.932\nNow before we go too far into this,\n\n00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:33.584\nI'd like to spend some time discussing\n\n00:08:33.584 --> 00:08:34.733\nsome key ideas.\n\n00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:35.944\nWhat are some key ideas\n\n00:08:35.944 --> 00:08:38.801\nthat makes all of this work?\n\n00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:41.028\nOne idea is active learning.\n\n00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:43.468\nThe idea here is, rather than have students\n\n00:08:43.468 --> 00:08:45.654\nwalk into class and watch lectures,\n\n00:08:45.654 --> 00:08:48.696\nwe replace this with what we call lessons.\n\n00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:50.940\nLessons are interleaved sequences\n\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.621\nof videos and interactive exercises.\n\n00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:56.800\nSo a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video\n\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.840\nand follow that with an interactive exercise.\n\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.985\nThink of this as the ultimate\nSocratization of education.\n\n00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:04.965\nYou teach by asking questions.\n\n00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:06.469\nAnd this is a form of learning\n\n00:09:06.469 --> 00:09:07.746\ncalled active learning,\n\n00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:11.025\nand really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,\n\n00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:12.543\nby Craik and Lockhart,\n\n00:09:12.543 --> 00:09:14.064\nwhere they said and discovered\n\n00:09:14.064 --> 00:09:16.444\nthat learning and retention really relates strongly\n\n00:09:16.444 --> 00:09:18.193\nto the depth of mental processing.\n\n00:09:18.193 --> 00:09:19.685\nStudents learn much better\n\n00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:22.873\nwhen they are interacting with the material.\n\n00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:25.651\nThe second idea is self-pacing.\n\n00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:27.287\nNow, when I went to a lecture hall,\n\n00:09:27.287 --> 00:09:28.577\nand if you were like me,\n\n00:09:28.577 --> 00:09:30.543\nby the fifth minute I would lose the professor.\n\n00:09:30.543 --> 00:09:34.123\nI wasn't all that smart, and I would\nbe scrambling, taking notes,\n\n00:09:34.123 --> 00:09:37.314\nand then I would lose the lecture\nfor the rest of the hour.\n\n00:09:37.314 --> 00:09:39.784\nInstead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,\n\n00:09:39.784 --> 00:09:43.652\nwe offer videos and interactive\nengagements to students?\n\n00:09:43.652 --> 00:09:45.383\nThey can hit the pause button.\n\n00:09:45.383 --> 00:09:47.874\nThey can rewind the professor.\n\n00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:50.973\nHeck, they can even mute the professor.\n\n00:09:50.973 --> 00:09:53.027\nSo this form of self-pacing\n\n00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:55.652\ncan be very helpful to learning.\n\n00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:59.006\nThe third idea that we have is instant feedback.\n\n00:09:59.006 --> 00:10:00.483\nWith instant feedback,\n\n00:10:00.483 --> 00:10:02.338\nthe computer grades exercises.\n\n00:10:02.338 --> 00:10:04.633\nI mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?\n\n00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:06.927\nYour computer is grading all the exercises.\n\n00:10:06.927 --> 00:10:08.461\nAnd we've all submitted homeworks,\n\n00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:10.502\nand your grades come back two weeks later,\n\n00:10:10.502 --> 00:10:12.126\nyou've forgotten all about it.\n\n00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:14.203\nI don't think I've still received\nsome of my homeworks\n\n00:10:14.203 --> 00:10:15.688\nfrom my undergraduate days.\n\n00:10:15.688 --> 00:10:17.035\nSome are never graded.\n\n00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:18.529\nSo with instant feedback,\n\n00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:20.019\nstudents can try to apply answers.\n\n00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.428\nIf they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.\n\n00:10:22.428 --> 00:10:24.076\nThey can try it again and try it again,\n\n00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:26.009\nand this really becomes much more engaging.\n\n00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:27.592\nThey get the instant feedback,\n\n00:10:27.592 --> 00:10:30.511\nand this little green check mark that you see here\n\n00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:34.101\nis becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.\n\n00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.989\nLearners are telling us that they go to bed at night\n\n00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:40.449\ndreaming of the green check mark.\n\n00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:42.251\nIn fact, one of our learners\n\n00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:45.032\nwho took the circuits course early last year,\n\n00:10:45.032 --> 00:10:46.964\nhe then went on to take a software course\n\n00:10:46.964 --> 00:10:49.265\nfrom Berkeley at the end of the year,\n\n00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:51.411\nand this is what the learner had to say\n\n00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:52.683\non our discussion board\n\n00:10:52.683 --> 00:10:54.209\nwhen he just started that course\n\n00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:56.730\nabout the green check mark:\n\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.787\n&amp;quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&amp;quot;\n\n00:10:58.787 --> 00:11:01.485\nWhen's the last time you've seen students\n\n00:11:01.485 --> 00:11:05.946\nposting comments like this about homework?\n\n00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:08.342\nMy colleague Ed Bertschinger,\n\n00:11:08.342 --> 00:11:10.512\nwho heads up the physics department at MIT,\n\n00:11:10.512 --> 00:11:13.356\nhas this to say about instant feedback:\n\n00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:16.357\nHe indicated that instant feedback\n\n00:11:16.357 --> 00:11:22.132\nturns teaching moments into learning outcomes.\n\n00:11:22.132 --> 00:11:24.424\nThe next big idea is gamification.\n\n00:11:24.424 --> 00:11:26.325\nYou know, all learners engage really well\n\n00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:27.834\nwith interactive videos and so on.\n\n00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:29.099\nYou know, they would sit down and shoot\n\n00:11:29.099 --> 00:11:31.443\nalien spaceships all day long until they get it.\n\n00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:34.230\nSo we applied these gamification\ntechniques to learning,\n\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.453\nand we can build these online laboratories.\n\n00:11:36.453 --> 00:11:38.700\nHow do you teach creativity?\nHow do you teach design?\n\n00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.379\nWe can do this through online labs\n\n00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:41.656\nand use computing power\n\n00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:43.245\nto build these online labs.\n\n00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:45.633\nSo as this little video shows here,\n\n00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:47.098\nyou can engage students\n\n00:11:47.098 --> 00:11:48.705\nmuch like they design with Legos.\n\n00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:50.623\nSo here, the learners are building a circuit\n\n00:11:50.623 --> 00:11:52.514\nwith Lego-like ease.\n\n00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:56.605\nAnd this can also be graded by the computer.\n\n00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:59.539\nFifth is peer learning.\n\n00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:02.374\nSo here, we use discussion forums and discussions\n\n00:12:02.374 --> 00:12:04.474\nand Facebook-like interaction\n\n00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.338\nnot as a distraction,\n\n00:12:06.338 --> 00:12:09.185\nbut to really help students learn.\n\n00:12:09.185 --> 00:12:10.902\nLet me tell you a story.\n\n00:12:10.902 --> 00:12:14.128\nWhen we did our circuits course\n\n00:12:14.128 --> 00:12:15.994\nfor the 155,000 students,\n\n00:12:15.994 --> 00:12:17.659\nI didn't sleep for three nights\n\n00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:19.546\nleading up to the launch of the course.\n\n00:12:19.546 --> 00:12:22.105\nI told my TAs, okay, 24/7,\n\n00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:23.371\nwe're going to be up\n\n00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:25.245\nmonitoring the forum, answering questions.\n\n00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.218\nThey had answered questions for 100 students.\n\n00:12:27.218 --> 00:12:30.079\nHow do you do that for 150,000?\n\n00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:32.415\nSo one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,\n\n00:12:32.415 --> 00:12:33.636\nand I think there's this question\n\n00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:35.607\nfrom a student from Pakistan,\n\n00:12:35.607 --> 00:12:36.935\nand he asked a question, and I said,\n\n00:12:36.935 --> 00:12:38.391\nokay, let me go and type up an answer,\n\n00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:39.999\nI don't type all that fast,\n\n00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:41.563\nand I begin typing up the answer,\n\n00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:43.257\nand before I can finish,\n\n00:12:43.257 --> 00:12:45.931\nanother student from Egypt\npopped in with an answer,\n\n00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.849\nnot quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,\n\n00:12:47.849 --> 00:12:49.817\nand before I can finish, a student from the U.S.\n\n00:12:49.817 --> 00:12:51.426\nhad popped in with a different answer.\n\n00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:54.226\nAnd then I sat back, fascinated.\n\n00:12:54.226 --> 00:12:56.173\nBoom, boom, boom, boom, the students were\n\n00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:58.124\ndiscussing and interacting with each other,\n\n00:12:58.124 --> 00:13:00.642\nand by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,\n\n00:13:00.642 --> 00:13:02.110\nhaving this epiphany,\n\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.366\nand by 4 a.m. in the morning,\n\n00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.119\nthey had discovered the right answer.\n\n00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:06.846\nAnd all I had to do was go and bless it,\n\n00:13:06.846 --> 00:13:08.812\n\"Good answer.\"\n\n00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:11.164\nSo this is absolutely amazing,\n\n00:13:11.164 --> 00:13:12.974\nwhere students are learning from each other,\n\n00:13:12.974 --> 00:13:15.791\nand they're telling us that they are learning\n\n00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:18.088\nby teaching.\n\n00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.068\nNow this is all not just in the future.\n\n00:13:20.068 --> 00:13:21.820\nThis is happening today.\n\n00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.137\nSo we are applying these blended learning pilots\n\n00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.878\nin a number of universities and \nhigh schools around the world,\n\n00:13:26.878 --> 00:13:28.664\nfrom Tsinghua in China\n\n00:13:28.664 --> 00:13:31.096\nto the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia\n\n00:13:31.096 --> 00:13:32.707\nto Berkeley in California --\n\n00:13:32.707 --> 00:13:34.066\nall over the world.\n\n00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:36.090\nAnd these kinds of technologies really help,\n\n00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.639\nthe blended model can really help\n\n00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:39.737\nrevolutionize education.\n\n00:13:39.737 --> 00:13:43.148\nIt can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,\n\n00:13:43.148 --> 00:13:44.828\nthe business aspect.\n\n00:13:44.828 --> 00:13:47.144\nWe can also license these MOOC courses\n\n00:13:47.144 --> 00:13:48.883\nto other universities,\n\n00:13:48.883 --> 00:13:51.447\nand therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,\n\n00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:53.836\nwhere the university that\nlicenses it with the professor\n\n00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:55.673\ncan use these online courses\n\n00:13:55.673 --> 00:13:57.874\nlike the next-generation textbook.\n\n00:13:57.874 --> 00:14:00.329\nThey can use as much or as little as they like,\n\n00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:05.815\nand it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.\n\n00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:07.865\nFinally, I would like to have you\n\n00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:10.706\ndream with me for a little bit.\n\n00:14:10.706 --> 00:14:14.875\nI would like us to really reimagine education.\n\n00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:19.000\nWe will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.\n\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.675\nWe have to move from books to tablets\n\n00:14:21.675 --> 00:14:23.501\nlike the Aakash in India\n\n00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:25.849\nor the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.\n\n00:14:25.849 --> 00:14:27.856\nThe Aakash is 40 dollars.\n\n00:14:27.856 --> 00:14:30.770\nWe have to move from\nbricks-and-mortar school buildings\n\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.391\nto digital dormitories.\n\n00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:34.839\nBut I think at the end of the day,\n\n00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:37.081\nI think we will still need one lecture hall\n\n00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:39.643\nin our universities.\n\n00:14:39.643 --> 00:14:42.467\nOtherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren\n\n00:14:42.467 --> 00:14:45.862\nthat your grandparents sat in that room\n\n00:14:45.862 --> 00:14:49.086\nin neat little rows like cornstalks\n\n00:14:49.086 --> 00:14:51.639\nand watched this professor at the end\n\n00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:54.286\ntalk about content and, you know,\n\n00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:56.933\nyou didn't even have a rewind button?\n\n00:14:56.933 --> 00:14:59.161\nThank you.\n\n00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:01.152\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:01.152 -->

Before that, I'd been a criminal prosecutor, first in the Manhattan district attorney's office, and then at the United States Department of Justice.But when I became the attorney general, two things happened that changed  the way I see criminal justice. The first is that I asked what I thought were really basic questions. I wanted to understand who we were arresting, who we were charging, and who we were putting in our nation's jails and prisons. I also wanted to understand if we were making decisions in a way that made us safer. And I couldn't get this information out. It turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn't track the things that matter. So after about a month of being incredibly frustrated, I walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives and stacks and stacks of case files, and the detectives were sitting there with yellow legal pads taking notes. They were trying to get the information I was looking for by going through case by case for the past five years. And as you can imagine, when we finally got the results, they weren't good. It turned out that we were doing a lot of low-level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in Trenton.The second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Camden, New Jersey police department. Now, at that time, Camden, New Jersey, was the most dangerous city in America. I ran the Camden Police Department because of that. I spent the day in the police department, and I was taken into a room with senior police officials, all of whom were working hard and trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden. And what I saw in that room, as we talked about how to reduce crime, were a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes. And they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board. And one of them said,  \"We had a robbery two weeks ago. We have no suspects.\" And another said, \"We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects.\" We weren't using data-driven policing. We were essentially trying to fight crime with yellow Post-it notes.Now, both of these things made me realize fundamentally that we were failing. We didn't even know who was in our criminal justice system, we didn't have any data about the things that mattered, and we didn't share data or use analytics or tools to help us make better decisions and to reduce crime. And for the first time, I started to think about how we made decisions. When I was an assistant D.A., and when I was a federal prosecutor, I looked at the cases in front of me, and I generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience. When I became attorney general, I could look at the system as a whole, and what surprised me is that I found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system \u2014 in police departments, in prosecutors's offices, in courts and in jails. And what I learned very quickly is that we weren't doing a good job. So I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work. In short, I wanted to moneyball criminal justice.Now, moneyball, as many of you know, is what the Oakland A's did, where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games, and they went from a system that  was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience, the scouts' instincts and experience, to pick players, from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games.It worked for the Oakland A's, and it worked in the state of New Jersey. We took Camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in America. We reduced murders there by 41 percent, which actually means 37 lives were saved. And we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent. We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions. So we went from doing low-level drug crimes that were outside our building to doing cases of statewide importance, on things like reducing violence with the most violent offenders, prosecuting street gangs, gun and drug trafficking, and political corruption.And all of this matters greatly, because public safety to me is the most important function of government. If we're not safe, we can't be educated, we can't be healthy, we can't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives. And we live in a country today where we face serious criminal justice problems. We have 12 million arrests every single year. The vast majority of those arrests are for low-level crimes, like misdemeanors, 70 to 80 percent. Less than five percent of all arrests are for violent crime. Yet we spend 75 billion, that's b for billion, dollars a year on state and local corrections costs. Right now, today, we have 2.3 million people in our jails and prisons. And we face unbelievable public safety challenges because we have a situation in which two thirds of the people in our jails are there waiting for trial. They haven't yet been convicted of a crime. They're just waiting for their day in court. And 67 percent of people come back. Our recidivism rate is amongst  the highest in the world. Almost seven in 10 people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration.So when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation, I came back to looking at a lot of these questions, and I came back to thinking about how we had used data and analytics to transform the way we did criminal justice in New Jersey. And when I look at the criminal justice system in the United States today, I feel the exact same way that I did about the state of New Jersey when I started there, which is that we absolutely have to do better, and I know that we can do better.So I decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision in public safety, and that decision is the determination of whether, when someone has been arrested, whether they pose a risk to public safety and should be detained, or whether they don't pose a risk to public safety and should be released. Everything that happens in criminal cases comes out of this one decision. It impacts everything. It impacts sentencing. It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment. It impacts crime and violence. And when I talk to judges around the United States, which I do all the time now, they all say the same thing, which is that we put dangerous people in jail, and we let non-dangerous, nonviolent people out. They mean it and they believe it. But when you start to look at the data, which, by the way, the judges don't have, when we start to look at the data, what we find time and time again, is that this isn't the case. We find low-risk offenders, which makes up 50 percent of our entire criminal justice population, we find that they're in jail. Take Leslie Chew, who was a Texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night. He was arrested, and he was kept in jail on 3,500 dollars bail, an amount that he could not afford to pay. And he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial, at a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars. And at the other end of the spectrum, we're doing an equally terrible job. The people who we find are the highest-risk offenders, the people who we think have the highest likelihood of committing a new crime if they're released, we see nationally that 50 percent of those people are being released.The reason for this is the way we make decisions. Judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk, but they're making them subjectively. They're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses. They're being subjective, and we know what happens with subjective decision making, which is that we are often wrong. What we need in this space are strong data and analytics.What I decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool, something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed by someone in front of them. I looked all over the country, and I found that between five and 10 percent of all U.S. jurisdictions actually use any type of risk assessment tool, and when I looked at these tools, I quickly realized why. They were unbelievably expensive to administer, they were time-consuming, they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they'd been created. So basically, they couldn't be scaled or transferred to other places.So I went out and built a phenomenal team of data scientists and researchers and statisticians to build a universal risk assessment tool, so that every single judge in the United States of America can have an objective, scientific measure of risk. In the tool that we've built, what we did was we collected 1.5 million cases from all around the United States, from cities, from counties, from every single state in the country, the federal districts. And with those 1.5 million cases, which is the largest data set on pretrial in the United States today, we were able to basically find that there were 900-plus risk factors that we could look at to try to figure out what mattered most. And we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk. And so we built a universal risk assessment tool. And it looks like this. As you'll see, we put some information in, but most of it is incredibly simple, it's easy to use, it focuses on things like the defendant's prior convictions, whether they've been sentenced to incarceration, whether they've engaged in violence before, whether they've even failed to come back to court. And with this tool, we can predict three things. First, whether or not someone will commit a new crime if they're released. Second, for the first time, and I think this is incredibly important, we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they're released. And that's the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them. And third, we can predict whether someone will come back to court. And every single judge in the United States of America can use it, because it's been created on a universal data set.What judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this \u2014 it's a dashboard. At the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score, six of course being the highest, and then in the middle you see, \"Elevated risk of violence.\" What that says is that this person is someone who has an elevated risk of violence that the judge should look twice at. And then, towards the bottom, you see the Failure to Appear Score, which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court.Now I want to say something really important. It's not that I think we should be eliminating the judge's instinct and experience from this process. I don't. I actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system errors, where we're incarcerating low-level, nonviolent people and we're releasing high-risk, dangerous people, is that we don't have an objective measure of risk. But what I believe should happen is that we should take that data-driven risk assessment and combine that with the judge's instinct and experience to lead us to better decision making. The tool went statewide in Kentucky on July 1, and we're about to go up in a number of other U.S. jurisdictions. Our goal, quite simply, is that every single judge in the United States will use a data-driven risk tool within the next five years. We're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well, to try to take a system that runs today in America the same way it did 50 years ago, based on instinct and experience, and make it into one that runs on data and analytics.Now, the great news about all this, and we have a ton of work left to do, and we have a lot of culture to change, but the great news about all of it is that we know it works. It's why Google is Google, and it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball to win games. The great news for us as well is that it's the way that we can transform the American criminal justice system. It's how we can make our streets safer, we can reduce our prison costs, and we can make our system much fairer and more just. Some people call it data science. I call it moneyballing criminal justice.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1914, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:15.392\nIn 2007, I became the attorney general\n\n00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:17.117\nof the state of New Jersey.\n\n00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.397\nBefore that, I'd been a criminal prosecutor,\n\n00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:22.078\nfirst in the Manhattan district attorney's office,\n\n00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:24.728\nand then at the United States Department of Justice.\n\n00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:26.929\nBut when I became the attorney general,\n\n00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.824\ntwo things happened that changed \nthe way I see criminal justice.\n\n00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:32.854\nThe first is that I asked what I thought\n\n00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:35.040\nwere really basic questions.\n\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.896\nI wanted to understand who we were arresting,\n\n00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:39.560\nwho we were charging,\n\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.688\nand who we were putting in our nation's jails\n\n00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:43.104\nand prisons.\n\n00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:44.752\nI also wanted to understand\n\n00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:46.081\nif we were making decisions\n\n00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.599\nin a way that made us safer.\n\n00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:51.851\nAnd I couldn't get this information out.\n\n00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:55.208\nIt turned out that most big criminal justice agencies\n\n00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:56.510\nlike my own\n\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.892\ndidn't track the things that matter.\n\n00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.210\nSo after about a month of being incredibly frustrated,\n\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.181\nI walked down into a conference room\n\n00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.071\nthat was filled with detectives\n\n00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:08.853\nand stacks and stacks of case files,\n\n00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:10.029\nand the detectives were sitting there\n\n00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:12.263\nwith yellow legal pads taking notes.\n\n00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:13.849\nThey were trying to get the information\n\n00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:15.067\nI was looking for\n\n00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:17.112\nby going through case by case\n\n00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:19.010\nfor the past five years.\n\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.663\nAnd as you can imagine,\n\n00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:23.306\nwhen we finally got the results, they weren't good.\n\n00:01:23.306 --> 00:01:24.961\nIt turned out that we were doing\n\n00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.981\na lot of low-level drug cases\n\n00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:28.456\non the streets just around the corner\n\n00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:30.724\nfrom our office in Trenton.\n\n00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.191\nThe second thing that happened\n\n00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.865\nis that I spent the day in the Camden,\nNew Jersey police department.\n\n00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:37.752\nNow, at that time, Camden, New Jersey,\n\n00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:40.404\nwas the most dangerous city in America.\n\n00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:44.231\nI ran the Camden Police\nDepartment because of that.\n\n00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:46.343\nI spent the day in the police department,\n\n00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:49.069\nand I was taken into a room\nwith senior police officials,\n\n00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.744\nall of whom were working hard\n\n00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:54.001\nand trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden.\n\n00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.827\nAnd what I saw in that room,\n\n00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:58.072\nas we talked about how to reduce crime,\n\n00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:01.931\nwere a series of officers with a\nlot of little yellow sticky notes.\n\n00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.777\nAnd they would take a yellow sticky\nand they would write something on it\n\n00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:06.580\nand they would put it up on a board.\n\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.751\nAnd one of them said, \n\"We had a robbery two weeks ago.\n\n00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:10.462\nWe have no suspects.\"\n\n00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:15.489\nAnd another said, \"We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week.

to reduce crime.\n\n00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:43.331\nAnd for the first time, I started to think\n\n00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:45.241\nabout how we made decisions.\n\n00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.638\nWhen I was an assistant D.A.,\n\n00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:48.508\nand when I was a federal prosecutor,\n\n00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:50.254\nI looked at the cases in front of me,\n\n00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.880\nand I generally made decisions based on my instinct\n\n00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.572\nand my experience.\n\n00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:56.231\nWhen I became attorney general,\n\n00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:57.870\nI could look at the system as a whole,\n\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.688\nand what surprised me is that I found\n\n00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:01.593\nthat that was exactly how we were doing it\n\n00:03:01.593 --> 00:03:03.896\nacross the entire system --\n\n00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:06.297\nin police departments, in prosecutors's offices,\n\n00:03:06.297 --> 00:03:09.097\nin courts and in jails.\n\n00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:11.294\nAnd what I learned very quickly\n\n00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:14.927\nis that we weren't doing a good job.\n\n00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:16.943\nSo I wanted to do things differently.\n\n00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:19.140\nI wanted to introduce data and analytics\n\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.189\nand rigorous statistical analysis\n\n00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:22.589\ninto our work.\n\n00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.559\nIn short, I wanted to moneyball criminal justice.\n\n00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.586\nNow, moneyball, as many of you know,\n\n00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:29.155\nis what the Oakland A's did,\n\n00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.128\nwhere they used smart data and statistics\n\n00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:32.750\nto figure out how to pick players\n\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.271\nthat would help them win games,\n\n00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.251\nand they went from a system that \nwas based on baseball scouts\n\n00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:39.111\nwho used to go out and watch players\n\n00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:40.748\nand use their instinct and experience,\n\n00:03:40.748 --> 00:03:42.491\nthe scouts' instincts and experience,\n\n00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.204\nto pick players, from one to use\n\n00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:47.026\nsmart data and rigorous statistical analysis\n\n00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:50.397\nto figure out how to pick players\nthat would help them win games.\n\n00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.195\nIt worked for the Oakland A's,\n\n00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.414\nand it worked in the state of New Jersey.\n\n00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:56.487\nWe took Camden off the top of the list\n\n00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:58.658\nas the most dangerous city in America.\n\n00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:01.813\nWe reduced murders there by 41 percent,\n\n00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:04.795\nwhich actually means 37 lives were saved.\n\n00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:08.535\nAnd we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent.\n\n00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:11.774\nWe also changed the way\nwe did criminal prosecutions.\n\n00:04:11.774 --> 00:04:13.779\nSo we went from doing low-level drug crimes\n\n00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.421\nthat were outside our building\n\n00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.763\nto doing cases of statewide importance,\n\n00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:20.921\non things like reducing violence\nwith the most violent offenders,\n\n00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.779\nprosecuting street gangs,\n\n00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.187\ngun and drug trafficking, and political corruption.\n\n00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:28.689\nAnd all of this matters greatly,\n\n00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.634\nbecause public safety to me\n\n00:04:30.634 --> 00:04:33.170\nis the most important function of government.\n\n00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.468\nIf we're not safe, we can't be educated,\n\n00:04:35.468 --> 00:04:36.816\nwe can't be healthy,\n\n00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:39.761\nwe can't do any of the other things\nwe want to do in our lives.\n\n00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.462\nAnd we live in a country today\n\n00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:44.596\nwhere we face serious criminal justice problems.\n\n00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:48.257\nWe have 12 million arrests every single year.\n\n00:04:48.257 --> 00:04:50.300\nThe vast majority of those arrests\n\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.312\nare for low-level crimes, like misdemeanors,\n\n00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:55.046\n70 to 80 percent.\n\n00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:57.037\nLess than five percent of all arrests\n\n00:04:57.037 --> 00:04:58.932\nare for violent crime.\n\n00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:00.987\nYet we spend 75 billion,\n\n00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:02.405\nthat's b for billion,\n\n00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:06.532\ndollars a year on state and local corrections costs.\n\n00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:09.373\nRight now, today, we have 2.3 million people\n\n00:05:09.373 --> 00:05:11.273\nin our jails and prisons.\n\n00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:14.069\nAnd we face unbelievable public safety challenges\n\n00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.008\nbecause we have a situation\n\n00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:18.906\nin which two thirds of the people in our jails\n\n00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:20.660\nare there waiting for trial.\n\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.795\nThey haven't yet been convicted of a crime.\n\n00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:24.914\nThey're just waiting for their day in court.\n\n00:05:24.914 --> 00:05:28.462\nAnd 67 percent of people come back.\n\n00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:31.490\nOur recidivism rate is amongst \nthe highest in the world.\n\n00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.593\nAlmost seven in 10 people who are released\n\n00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:35.244\nfrom prison will be rearrested\n\n00:05:35.244 --> 00:05:39.199\nin a constant cycle of crime and incarceration.\n\n00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.781\nSo when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation,\n\n00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:44.517\nI came back to looking at a lot of these questions,\n\n00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:46.171\nand I came back to thinking about how\n\n00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.554\nwe had used data and analytics to transform\n\n00:05:48.554 --> 00:05:51.138\nthe way we did criminal justice in New Jersey.\n\n00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:53.282\nAnd when I look at the criminal justice system\n\n00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:54.938\nin the United States today,\n\n00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.577\nI feel the exact same way that I did\n\n00:05:56.577 --> 00:05:59.043\nabout the state of New Jersey when I started there,\n\n00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:02.271\nwhich is that we absolutely have to do better,\n\n00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:04.194\nand I know that we can do better.\n\n00:06:04.194 --> 00:06:05.899\nSo I decided to focus\n\n00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.116\non using data and analytics\n\n00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:10.477\nto help make the most critical decision\n\n00:06:10.477 --> 00:06:12.083\nin public safety,\n\n00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:14.104\nand that decision is the determination\n\n00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:16.639\nof whether, when someone has been arrested,\n\n00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.554\nwhether they pose a risk to public safety\n\n00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:20.080\nand should be detained,\n\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.436\nor whether they don't pose a risk to public safety\n\n00:06:22.436 --> 00:06:24.073\nand should be released.\n\n00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:25.992\nEverything that happens in criminal cases\n\n00:06:25.992 --> 00:06:27.764\ncomes out of this one decision.\n\n00:06:27.764 --> 00:06:29.260\nIt impacts everything.\n\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.610\nIt impacts sentencing.\n\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.511\nIt impacts whether someone gets drug treatment.\n\n00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:34.834\nIt impacts crime and violence.\n\n00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:36.771\nAnd when I talk to judges around the United States,\n\n00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.699\nwhich I do all the time now,\n\n00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.536\nthey all say the same thing,\n\n00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:43.643\nwhich is that we put dangerous people in jail,\n\n00:06:43.643 --> 00:06:47.168\nand we let non-dangerous, nonviolent people out.\n\n00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:49.401\nThey mean it and they believe it.\n\n00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:51.134\nBut when you start to look at the data,\n\n00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:53.598\nwhich, by the way, the judges don't have,\n\n00:06:53.598 --> 00:06:55.210\nwhen we start to look at the data,\n\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.628\nwhat we find time and time again,\n\n00:06:57.628 --> 00:06:59.610\nis that this isn't the case.\n\n00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.291\nWe find low-risk offenders,\n\n00:07:01.291 --> 00:07:05.005\nwhich makes up 50 percent of our\nentire criminal justice population,\n\n00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:07.404\nwe find that they're in jail.\n\n00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.890\nTake Leslie Chew, who was a Texas man\n\n00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.774\nwho stole four blankets on a cold winter night.\n\n00:07:12.774 --> 00:07:15.369\nHe was arrested, and he was kept in jail\n\n00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:17.422\non 3,500 dollars bail,\n\n00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:20.198\nan amount that he could not afford to pay.\n\n00:07:20.198 --> 00:07:22.786\nAnd he stayed in jail for eight months\n\n00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:24.851\nuntil his case came up for trial,\n\n00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:28.756\nat a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars.\n\n00:07:28.756 --> 00:07:30.753\nAnd at the other end of the spectrum,\n\n00:07:30.753 --> 00:07:33.035\nwe're doing an equally terrible job.\n\n00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.607\nThe people who we find\n\n00:07:34.607 --> 00:07:36.626\nare the highest-risk offenders,\n\n00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:39.123\nthe people who we think have the highest likelihood\n\n00:07:39.123 --> 00:07:41.075\nof committing a new crime if they're released,\n\n00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:44.025\nwe see nationally that 50 percent of those people\n\n00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:45.999\nare being released.\n\n00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:49.173\nThe reason for this is the way we make decisions.\n\n00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:50.882\nJudges have the best intentions\n\n00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:52.834\nwhen they make these decisions about risk,\n\n00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:55.318\nbut they're making them subjectively.\n\n00:07:55.318 --> 00:07:57.464\nThey're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago\n\n00:07:57.464 --> 00:07:59.595\nwho were using their instinct and their experience\n\n00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.274\nto try to decide what risk someone poses.\n\n00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:03.804\nThey're being subjective,\n\n00:08:03.804 --> 00:08:06.864\nand we know what happens\nwith subjective decision making,\n\n00:08:06.864 --> 00:08:09.607\nwhich is that we are often wrong.\n\n00:08:09.607 --> 00:08:10.990\nWhat we need in this space\n\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.542\nare strong data and analytics.\n\n00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:15.289\nWhat I decided to look for\n\n00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:18.125\nwas a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool,\n\n00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:20.889\nsomething that would let judges actually understand\n\n00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:23.148\nwith a scientific and objective way\n\n00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:24.795\nwhat the risk was that was posed\n\n00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:26.405\nby someone in front of them.\n\n00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.054\nI looked all over the country,\n\n00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:29.996\nand I found that between five and 10 percent\n\n00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:31.325\nof all U.S. jurisdictions\n\n00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:34.303\nactually use any type of risk assessment tool,\n\n00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:35.928\nand when I looked at these tools,\n\n00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:37.788\nI quickly realized why.\n\n00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:40.478\nThey were unbelievably expensive to administer,\n\n00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.006\nthey were time-consuming,\n\n00:08:42.006 --> 00:08:44.113\nthey were limited to the local jurisdiction\n\n00:08:44.113 --> 00:08:45.543\nin which they'd been created.\n\n00:08:45.543 --> 00:08:47.336\nSo basically, they couldn't be scaled\n\n00:08:47.336 --> 00:08:49.545\nor transferred to other places.\n\n00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:51.782\nSo I went out and built a phenomenal team\n\n00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:53.826\nof data scientists and researchers\n\n00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:55.452\nand statisticians\n\n00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:58.297\nto build a universal risk assessment tool,\n\n00:08:58.297 --> 00:09:00.690\nso that every single judge in\nthe United States of America\n\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.014\ncan have an objective, scientific measure of risk.\n\n00:09:05.014 --> 00:09:06.672\nIn the tool that we've built,\n\n00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:09.540\nwhat we did was we collected 1.5 million cases\n\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.238\nfrom all around the United States,\n\n00:09:11.238 --> 00:09:12.882\nfrom cities, from counties,\n\n00:09:12.882 --> 00:09:14.393\nfrom every single state in the country,\n\n00:09:14.393 --> 00:09:16.139\nthe federal districts.\n\n00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.328\nAnd with those 1.5 million cases,\n\n00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:20.268\nwhich is the largest data set on pretrial\n\n00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.073\nin the United States today,\n\n00:09:22.073 --> 00:09:23.938\nwe were able to basically find that there were\n\n00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:27.260\n900-plus risk factors that we could look at\n\n00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.126\nto try to figure out what mattered most.\n\n00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:32.207\nAnd we found that there were nine specific things\n\n00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:34.442\nthat mattered all across the country\n\n00:09:34.442 --> 00:09:37.419\nand that were the most highly predictive of risk.\n\n00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:41.124\nAnd so we built a universal risk assessment tool.\n\n00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:42.569\nAnd it looks like this.\n\n00:09:42.569 --> 00:09:45.181\nAs you'll see, we put some information in,\n\n00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:47.194\nbut most of it is incredibly simple,\n\n00:09:47.194 --> 00:09:48.626\nit's easy to use,\n\n00:09:48.626 --> 00:09:51.595\nit focuses on things like the\ndefendant's prior convictions,\n\n00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.574\nwhether they've been sentenced to incarceration,\n\n00:09:53.574 --> 00:09:55.838\nwhether they've engaged in violence before,\n\n00:09:55.838 --> 00:09:58.231\nwhether they've even failed to come back to court.\n\n00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:00.731\nAnd with this tool, we can predict three things.\n\n00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:02.584\nFirst, whether or not someone will commit\n\n00:10:02.584 --> 00:10:04.149\na new crime if they're released.\n\n00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:05.813\nSecond, for the first time,\n\n00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:07.674\nand I think this is incredibly important,\n\n00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:09.597\nwe can predict whether someone will commit\n\n00:10:09.597 --> 00:10:11.431\nan act of violence if they're released.\n\n00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:13.318\nAnd that's the single most important thing\n\n00:10:13.318 --> 00:10:15.125\nthat judges say when you talk to them.\n\n00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:16.953\nAnd third, we can predict whether someone\n\n00:10:16.953 --> 00:10:18.943\nwill come back to court.\n\n00:10:18.943 --> 00:10:21.976\nAnd every single judge in the\nUnited States of America can use it,\n\n00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:25.788\nbecause it's been created on a universal data set.\n\n00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:28.397\nWhat judges see if they run the risk assessment tool\n\n00:10:28.397 --> 00:10:30.517\nis this -- it's a dashboard.\n\n00:10:30.517 --> 00:10:33.365\nAt the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score,\n\n00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.294\nsix of course being the highest,\n\n00:10:35.294 --> 00:10:37.697\nand then in the middle you\nsee, \"Elevated risk of violence.\"\n\n00:10:37.697 --> 00:10:39.443\nWhat that says is that this person\n\n00:10:39.443 --> 00:10:41.503\nis someone who has an elevated risk of violence\n\n00:10:41.503 --> 00:10:43.388\nthat the judge should look twice at.\n\n00:10:43.388 --> 00:10:44.724\nAnd then, towards the bottom,\n\n00:10:44.724 --> 00:10:46.692\nyou see the Failure to Appear Score,\n\n00:10:46.692 --> 00:10:48.084\nwhich again is the likelihood\n\n00:10:48.084 --> 00:10:51.097\nthat someone will come back to court.\n\n00:10:51.097 --> 00:10:53.310\nNow I want to say something really important.\n\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.037\nIt's not that I think we should be eliminating\n\n00:10:56.037 --> 00:10:58.281\nthe judge's instinct and experience\n\n00:10:58.281 --> 00:10:59.885\nfrom this process.\n\n00:10:59.885 --> 00:11:00.943\nI don't.\n\n00:11:00.943 --> 00:11:02.950\nI actually believe the problem that we see\n\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.804\nand the reason that we have\nthese incredible system errors,\n\n00:11:05.804 --> 00:11:08.891\nwhere we're incarcerating\nlow-level, nonviolent people\n\n00:11:08.891 --> 00:11:12.063\nand we're releasing high-risk, dangerous people,\n\n00:11:12.063 --> 00:11:14.786\nis that we don't have an objective measure of risk.\n\n00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:16.086\nBut what I believe should happen\n\n00:11:16.086 --> 00:11:18.886\nis that we should take that\ndata-driven risk assessment\n\n00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:21.927\nand combine that with the\njudge's instinct and experience\n\n00:11:21.927 --> 00:11:24.885\nto lead us to better decision making.\n\n00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:28.188\nThe tool went statewide in Kentucky on July 1,\n\n00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.539\nand we're about to go up in a\nnumber of other U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:34.130\nOur goal, quite simply, is that every single judge\n\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.322\nin the United States will use a data-driven risk tool\n\n00:11:36.322 --> 00:11:38.413\nwithin the next five years.\n\n00:11:38.413 --> 00:11:39.765\nWe're now working on risk tools\n\n00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:43.049\nfor prosecutors and for police officers as well,\n\n00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:45.749\nto try to take a system that runs today\n\n00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:48.545\nin America the same way it did 50 years ago,\n\n00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:50.642\nbased on instinct and experience,\n\n00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:52.497\nand make it into one that runs\n\n00:11:52.497 --> 00:11:54.966\non data and analytics.\n\n00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:56.887\nNow, the great news about all this,\n\n00:11:56.887 --> 00:11:58.504\nand we have a ton of work left to do,\n\n00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:00.361\nand we have a lot of culture to change,\n\n00:12:00.361 --> 00:12:02.107\nbut the great news about all of it\n\n00:12:02.107 --> 00:12:03.975\nis that we know it works.\n\n00:12:03.975 --> 00:12:06.128\nIt's why Google is Google,\n\n00:12:06.128 --> 00:12:08.590\nand it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball\n\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.371\nto win games.\n\n00:12:10.371 --> 00:12:12.108\nThe great news for us as well\n\n00:12:12.108 --> 00:12:14.004\nis that it's the way that we can transform\n\n00:12:14.004 --> 00:12:16.325\nthe American criminal justice system.\n\n00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:18.682\nIt's how we can make our streets safer,\n\n00:12:18.682 --> 00:12:20.981\nwe can reduce our prison costs,\n\n00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.048\nand we can make our system much fairer\n\n00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:24.773\nand more just.\n\n00:12:24.773 --> 00:12:26.935\nSome people call it data science.\n\n00:12:26.935 --> 00:12:29.236\nI call it moneyballing criminal justice.\n\n00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:31.040\nThank you.\n\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.133\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Want to be an activist? Start with your toys", "duration": "322", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mckenna_pope_want_to_be_an_activist_start_with_your_toys", "transcript": "I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old, and when I was 13, I convinced one of the largest toy companies, toymakers, in the world, Hasbro, to change the way that they marketed one of their most best-selling products.So allow me to tell you about it. So I have a brother, Gavin. When this whole shebang happened, he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions, or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an Easy-Bake Oven. Right? I mean, we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly.But then he started to realize something. In the commercials, and on the  boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple, very gender-specific colors to females, right? So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef, because that was something that girls did. Girls cooked; boys didn't, or so was the message that Hasbro was sending.And this got me thinking, God, I wish there was a way that I could change this, that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it. And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. And so I created a petition along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors.So this petition started to take off \u2014 humongously fast, you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. In three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition.(Applause)Thank you.So, needless to say, it was crazy. Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy-Bake Oven product to me in black, silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\" That thing was amazing.What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist, I could change something, that even as a kid, or maybe  even especially as a kid, my voice mattered, and your voice matters too. I want to let you know it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me, because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family, and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. And actually, I have some examples, because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? So, let's see. From user name Liquidsore29 \u2014 interesting user names we have here\u2014 \"Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.\" Liquidsore29, really? Really? Okay. How about from Whiteboy77AGS: \"People always need something to (female dog) about.\" From Jeffrey Gutierrez: \"OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention.\"So it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, people don't care, people think it's a waste of time, and people are going to be disrespectful  to me and my family. It hurt me, and it made me think, what's the point of making change in the future?But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on, say it with me. One, two, three: Haters gonna hate. So let your haters hate, you know what, and make your change, because I know you can. I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change, and I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you  can do and that you believe in, and you can trade it across all these social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through  YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been  hearing about all day today, you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1915, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:15.071\nI'm McKenna Pope.

boys aren't.\n\n00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:23.689\nAnd this discouraged my brother a lot.\n\n00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.266\nHe thought that he wasn't\nsupposed to want to be a chef,\n\n00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.123\nbecause that was something that girls did.\n\n00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:30.628\nGirls cooked;

And one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us, and today I want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity.But first, what do we call complexity? What is complex? Well, complex is not complicated. Something complicated comprises many small parts, all different, and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery. On the opposite, a complex system is made of many, many similar parts, and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior. Complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple, individual rules, and this results in emergent properties. The behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only. As Aristotle wrote, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. But from Aristotle, let's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems.These are Scottish terriers. In the beginning, the system is disorganized. Then comes a perturbation: milk. Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens. The pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction.So it's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges. I call this simplifying complexity, and it's what we do at the chair of systems design at ETH Zurich. We collect data on animal populations, analyze complex patterns, try to explain them. It requires physicists who work with biologists, with mathematicians and computer scientists, and it is their interaction that produces cross-boundary competence to solve these problems. So again, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In a way, collaboration is another example of a complex system.And you may be asking yourself which side I'm on, biology or physics? In fact, it's a little different, and to explain, I need to tell you a short story about myself. When I was a child, I loved to build stuff, to create complicated machines. So I set out to study electrical engineering and robotics, and my end-of-studies project was about building a robot called ER-1 \u2014 it looked like this\u2014 that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground. It was very, very complicated, but it worked beautifully in our test room, and on demo day, professors had  assembled to grade the project. So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room. It turned out, the light in that room was slightly different. The robot's vision system got confused. At the first bend in the line, it left its course, and crashed into a wall. We had spent weeks building it, and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room. That's when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine, the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected. And I decided that, in fact, I didn't really want to create complicated stuff. I wanted to understand complexity, the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom.Which brings us to bats. Bechstein's bats are a common species of European bats. They are very social animals. Mostly they roost, or sleep, together. And they live in maternity colonies, which means that every spring, the females meet after the winter hibernation, and they stay together for about six months to rear their young, and they all carry a very small chip, which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes, we know where she is, and more importantly, we know with whom she is. So I study roosting associations in bats, and this is what it looks like. During the day, the bats roost in a number of sub-groups in different boxes. It could be that on one day, the colony is split between two boxes, but on another day, it could be together in a single box, or split between three or more boxes, and that all seems rather erratic, really. It's called fission-fusion dynamics, the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups.So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony. Okay? So that's what this picture looks like. In this network, all the circles are nodes, individual bats, and the lines between them are social bonds, associations between individuals. It turns out this is a very interesting picture. This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission-fusion dynamics. We call them cryptic social units. Even more interesting, in fact: Every year, around October, the colony splits up, and all bats hibernate separately, but year after year, when the bats come together again in the spring, the communities stay the same.So these bats remember their friends for a really long time. With a brain the size of a peanut, they maintain individualized, long-term social bonds, We didn't know that was possible. We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that, but compared to bats, they have huge brains. So how could it be that the bats maintain this complex, stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities?And this is where complexity brings an answer. To understand this system, we built a computer model of roosting, based on simple, individual rules, and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony. It's a mathematical model, but it's not complicated. What the model told us is that, in a nutshell, each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends, and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them. Simple, individual rules. This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats.But it gets better. Between 2010 and 2011, the colony lost more than two thirds of its members, probably due to the very cold winter. The next spring, it didn't form two communities like every year, which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small. Instead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit, which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years. What we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this. All they do is follow simple association rules, and from this simplicity emerges social complexity which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure. And I find this incredible.Now I want to tell you another story, but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. This is where meerkats live. I'm sure you know meerkats. They're fascinating creatures. They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy. There is one dominant pair, and many subordinates, some acting as sentinels, some acting as babysitters, some teaching pups, and so on. What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together, and what this has to do with their social structure. And there's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats. In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road. On this road there are cars, so it's dangerous. But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another. So we asked, how exactly do they do this? We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road, but when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road, she gives way to the subordinates, a manner of saying, \"Go ahead, tell me if it's safe.\" What I didn't know, in fact, was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.So I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road. It's a simplistic model. Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment. They simply move together. When these particles get to the road, they sense some kind of obstacle, and they bounce against it. The only difference between the dominant female, here in red, and the other individuals, is that for her, the height of the obstacle, which is in fact the risk perceived from the road, is just slightly higher, and this tiny difference in the individual's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe, that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first. George Box, who was an English statistician, once wrote, \"All models are false, but some models are useful.\" And in fact, this model is obviously false, because in reality, meerkats are anything but random particles. But it's also useful, because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group. So again, that's simplifying complexity.I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species. When the dominant female gives way to a subordinate, it's not out of courtesy. In fact, the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group. If she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk. So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response. These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old, and they're adapting it to a modern risk, in this case a road built by humans. They adapt very simple rules, and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat.In the end, it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash, or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road, or it may be another species. My message here \u2014 and it's not a complicated one, but a simple one of wonder and hope \u2014 my message here is that animals show extraordinary social complexity, and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment. In three words, in the animal kingdom, simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience.Thank you.(Applause) Dania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas, for this great start. Little bit nervous? Nicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks. DG: Okay, great. I'm sure a  lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about \u2014 the bats, meerkats \u2014 and humans. You brought some examples: The females are the social ones, the females are the dominant ones, I'm not sure who thinks how. But is it okay to do these associations? Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species? NP: Well, I would say there are also counter-examples to these stereotypes. For examples, in sea horses or in koalas, in fact, it is the males who take care of the young always. And the lesson is that it's often difficult, and sometimes even a bit dangerous, to draw parallels between humans and animals. So that's it. DG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.

months\n\n00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:39.188\nto rear their young,\n\n00:04:39.188 --> 00:04:41.993\nand they all carry a very small chip,\n\n00:04:41.993 --> 00:04:43.864\nwhich means that every time one of them\n\n00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:46.921\nenters one of these specially equipped bat boxes,\n\n00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:48.564\nwe know where she is,\n\n00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:49.733\nand more importantly,\n\n00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:52.296\nwe know with whom she is.\n\n00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:55.990\nSo I study roosting associations in bats,\n\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.435\nand this is what it looks like.\n\n00:04:58.435 --> 00:05:00.877\nDuring the day, the bats roost\n\n00:05:00.877 --> 00:05:03.181\nin a number of sub-groups in different boxes.\n\n00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:05.110\nIt could be that on one day,\n\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.330\nthe colony is split between two boxes,\n\n00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.630\nbut on another day,\n\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.871\nit could be together in a single box,\n\n00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.187\nor split between three or more boxes,\n\n00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:16.114\nand that all seems rather erratic, really.\n\n00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:19.317\nIt's called fission-fusion dynamics,\n\n00:05:19.317 --> 00:05:21.030\nthe property for an animal group\n\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.208\nof regularly splitting and merging\n\n00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:24.869\ninto different subgroups.\n\n00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:27.431\nSo what we do is take all these data\n\n00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.093\nfrom all these different days\n\n00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:30.597\nand pool them together\n\n00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:33.214\nto extract a long-term association pattern\n\n00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:35.719\nby applying techniques with network analysis\n\n00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.340\nto get a complete picture\n\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.877\nof the social structure of the colony.\n\n00:05:39.877 --> 00:05:44.142\nOkay? So that's what this picture looks like.\n\n00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:46.536\nIn this network, all the circles\n\n00:05:46.536 --> 00:05:49.313\nare nodes, individual bats,\n\n00:05:49.313 --> 00:05:50.896\nand the lines between them\n\n00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:54.560\nare social bonds, associations between individuals.\n\n00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.238\nIt turns out this is a very interesting picture.\n\n00:05:57.238 --> 00:05:59.220\nThis bat colony is organized\n\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.088\nin two different communities\n\n00:06:01.088 --> 00:06:02.927\nwhich cannot be predicted\n\n00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:05.176\nfrom the daily fission-fusion dynamics.\n\n00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:08.726\nWe call them cryptic social units.\n\n00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:10.342\nEven more interesting, in fact:\n\n00:06:10.342 --> 00:06:12.706\nEvery year, around October,\n\n00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.267\nthe colony splits up,\n\n00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:16.965\nand all bats hibernate separately,\n\n00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:18.426\nbut year after year,\n\n00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:21.499\nwhen the bats come together again in the spring,\n\n00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.089\nthe communities stay the same.\n\n00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.809\nSo these bats remember their friends\n\n00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:28.639\nfor a really long time.\n\n00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.113\nWith a brain the size of a peanut,\n\n00:06:31.113 --> 00:06:33.238\nthey maintain individualized,\n\n00:06:33.238 --> 00:06:35.380\nlong-term social bonds,\n\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.104\nWe didn't know that was possible.\n\n00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:38.863\nWe knew that primates\n\n00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:41.431\nand elephants and dolphins could do that,\n\n00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:44.059\nbut compared to bats, they have huge brains.\n\n00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:46.458\nSo how could it be\n\n00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:48.409\nthat the bats maintain this complex,\n\n00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:50.097\nstable social structure\n\n00:06:50.097 --> 00:06:53.629\nwith such limited cognitive abilities?\n\n00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.518\nAnd this is where complexity brings an answer.\n\n00:06:56.518 --> 00:06:58.659\nTo understand this system,\n\n00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:01.456\nwe built a computer model of roosting,\n\n00:07:01.456 --> 00:07:03.474\nbased on simple, individual rules,\n\n00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:05.909\nand simulated thousands and thousands of days\n\n00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.928\nin the virtual bat colony.\n\n00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:10.052\nIt's a mathematical model,\n\n00:07:10.052 --> 00:07:12.006\nbut it's not complicated.\n\n00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:15.104\nWhat the model told us is that, in a nutshell,\n\n00:07:15.104 --> 00:07:18.290\neach bat knows a few other colony members\n\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.778\nas her friends, and is just slightly more likely\n\n00:07:20.778 --> 00:07:23.288\nto roost in a box with them.\n\n00:07:23.288 --> 00:07:25.732\nSimple, individual rules.\n\n00:07:25.732 --> 00:07:27.444\nThis is all it takes to explain\n\n00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:29.833\nthe social complexity of these bats.\n\n00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.551\nBut it gets better.\n\n00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:34.399\nBetween 2010 and 2011,\n\n00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:37.852\nthe colony lost more than two thirds of its members,\n\n00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:40.838\nprobably due to the very cold winter.\n\n00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:43.982\nThe next spring, it didn't form two communities\n\n00:07:43.982 --> 00:07:45.253\nlike every year,\n\n00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:47.456\nwhich may have led the whole colony to die\n\n00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:49.551\nbecause it had become too small.\n\n00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:54.924\nInstead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit,\n\n00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:57.656\nwhich allowed the colony to survive that season\n\n00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:00.760\nand thrive again in the next two years.\n\n00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.538\nWhat we know is that the bats\n\n00:08:02.538 --> 00:08:05.445\nare not aware that their colony is doing this.\n\n00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:08.991\nAll they do is follow simple association rules,\n\n00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.340\nand from this simplicity\n\n00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.781\nemerges social complexity\n\n00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:15.621\nwhich allows the colony to be resilient\n\n00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.602\nagainst dramatic changes\nin the population structure.\n\n00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:21.296\nAnd I find this incredible.\n\n00:08:21.296 --> 00:08:23.380\nNow I want to tell you another story,\n\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.935\nbut for this we have to travel from Europe\n\n00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:27.983\nto the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.\n\n00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:30.010\nThis is where meerkats live.\n\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.510\nI'm sure you know meerkats.\n\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.616\nThey're fascinating creatures.\n\n00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:36.605\nThey live in groups with a\nvery strict social hierarchy.\n\n00:08:36.605 --> 00:08:38.064\nThere is one dominant pair,\n\n00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:39.446\nand many subordinates,\n\n00:08:39.446 --> 00:08:41.160\nsome acting as sentinels,\n\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.497\nsome acting as babysitters,\n\n00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:44.394\nsome teaching pups, and so on.\n\n00:08:44.394 --> 00:08:47.715\nWhat we do is put very small GPS collars\n\n00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:49.240\non these animals\n\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.115\nto study how they move together,\n\n00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:54.832\nand what this has to do with their social structure.\n\n00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:56.322\nAnd there's a very interesting example\n\n00:08:56.322 --> 00:08:59.038\nof collective movement in meerkats.\n\n00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.405\nIn the middle of the reserve which they live in\n\n00:09:01.405 --> 00:09:02.614\nlies a road.\n\n00:09:02.614 --> 00:09:05.847\nOn this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.\n\n00:09:05.847 --> 00:09:08.131\nBut the meerkats have to cross it\n\n00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.705\nto get from one feeding place to another.\n\n00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:15.456\nSo we asked, how exactly do they do this?\n\n00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:17.292\nWe found that the dominant female\n\n00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:19.913\nis mostly the one who leads the group to the road,\n\n00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:23.185\nbut when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road,\n\n00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:25.536\nshe gives way to the subordinates,\n\n00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:27.313\na manner of saying,\n\n00:09:27.313 --> 00:09:29.995\n\"Go ahead, tell me if it's safe.\"\n\n00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:31.659\nWhat I didn't know, in fact,\n\n00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:34.801\nwas what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow\n\n00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:37.726\nfor this change at the edge of the group to happen\n\n00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:41.576\nand if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.\n\n00:09:41.576 --> 00:09:45.567\nSo I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats\n\n00:09:45.567 --> 00:09:47.480\ncrossing a simulated road.\n\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.352\nIt's a simplistic model.\n\n00:09:49.352 --> 00:09:52.192\nMoving meerkats are like random particles\n\n00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:54.414\nwhose unique rule is one of alignment.\n\n00:09:54.414 --> 00:09:56.820\nThey simply move together.\n\n00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.004\nWhen these particles get to the road,\n\n00:10:00.004 --> 00:10:01.946\nthey sense some kind of obstacle,\n\n00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:04.030\nand they bounce against it.\n\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.186\nThe only difference\n\n00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:07.228\nbetween the dominant female, here in red,\n\n00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:08.713\nand the other individuals,\n\n00:10:08.713 --> 00:10:11.267\nis that for her, the height of the obstacle,\n\n00:10:11.267 --> 00:10:13.772\nwhich is in fact the risk perceived from the road,\n\n00:10:13.772 --> 00:10:15.721\nis just slightly higher,\n\n00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:17.382\nand this tiny difference\n\n00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:19.220\nin the individual's rule of movement\n\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.666\nis sufficient to explain what we observe,\n\n00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:24.226\nthat the dominant female\n\n00:10:24.226 --> 00:10:25.660\nleads her group to the road\n\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.330\nand then gives way to the others\n\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.193\nfor them to cross first.\n\n00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:33.844\nGeorge Box, who was an English statistician,\n\n00:10:33.844 --> 00:10:36.806\nonce wrote, \"All models are false,\n\n00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:38.865\nbut some models are useful.\"\n\n00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:42.062\nAnd in fact, this model is obviously false,\n\n00:10:42.062 --> 00:10:46.030\nbecause in reality, meerkats are\nanything but random particles.\n\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.667\nBut it's also useful,\n\n00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:50.416\nbecause it tells us that extreme simplicity\n\n00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:53.774\nin movement rules at the individual level\n\n00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:56.125\ncan result in a great deal of complexity\n\n00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:58.063\nat the level of the group.\n\n00:10:58.063 --> 00:11:02.119\nSo again, that's simplifying complexity.\n\n00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:03.567\nI would like to conclude\n\n00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:06.384\non what this means for the whole species.\n\n00:11:06.384 --> 00:11:08.048\nWhen the dominant female\n\n00:11:08.048 --> 00:11:09.614\ngives way to a subordinate,\n\n00:11:09.614 --> 00:11:11.731\nit's not out of courtesy.\n\n00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:13.238\nIn fact, the dominant female\n\n00:11:13.238 --> 00:11:15.757\nis extremely important for the cohesion of the group.\n\n00:11:15.757 --> 00:11:19.269\nIf she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.\n\n00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:21.505\nSo this behavior of risk avoidance\n\n00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:24.306\nis a very old evolutionary response.\n\n00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:28.175\nThese meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic\n\n00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:30.408\nthat is thousands of generations old,\n\n00:11:30.408 --> 00:11:32.822\nand they're adapting it to a modern risk,\n\n00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:36.147\nin this case a road built by humans.\n\n00:11:36.147 --> 00:11:38.542\nThey adapt very simple rules,\n\n00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:40.831\nand the resulting complex behavior\n\n00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:43.787\nallows them to resist human encroachment\n\n00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.235\ninto their natural habitat.\n\n00:11:46.235 --> 00:11:48.037\nIn the end,\n\n00:11:48.037 --> 00:11:50.737\nit may be bats which change their social structure\n\n00:11:50.737 --> 00:11:53.121\nin response to a population crash,\n\n00:11:53.121 --> 00:11:54.520\nor it may be meerkats\n\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.722\nwho show a novel adaptation to a human road,\n\n00:11:57.722 --> 00:12:00.407\nor it may be another species.\n\n00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:03.200\nMy message here -- and it's not a complicated one,\n\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.964\nbut a simple one of wonder and hope --\n\n00:12:05.964 --> 00:12:09.057\nmy message here is that animals\n\n00:12:09.057 --> 00:12:11.481\nshow extraordinary social complexity,\n\n00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.922\nand this allows them to adapt\n\n00:12:13.922 --> 00:12:17.403\nand respond to changes in their environment.\n\n00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:20.171\nIn three words, in the animal kingdom,\n\n00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:22.945\nsimplicity leads to complexity\n\n00:12:22.945 --> 00:12:24.428\nwhich leads to resilience.\n\n00:12:24.428 --> 00:12:26.712\nThank you.\n\n00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:33.392\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:42.652 --> 00:12:44.605\nDania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas,\n\n00:12:44.605

Your food will be served shortly.(Applause)Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, and I've been making animated flip books since I was three years old. At that age, I also learned about what an animator was. There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don't know about. When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV, I immediately said, \"That's what I want to be.\" I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud, but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.Animation and art has always been my first love. It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for \"Malicious Dishes.\" There was a virus on my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it, and all of a sudden, I just thought, what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer? Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things? And thus, \"Malicious Dishes\" was born.At four years old, my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again. That started my love for technology. I built my first website myself in HTML, and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.I'm also working on an animated series called \"The Pollinators.\" It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they're so important. If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators, then all creatures, including ourselves, that depend on these plants, would starve. So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team. (Applause) (Foot stomp) (Music) (Roar) Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known! I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators! (Music)Thank you. (Applause)All of my animations start with ideas, but what are ideas? Ideas can spark a movement. Ideas are opportunities and innovation. Ideas truly are what make the world go round. If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be where we are now with technology, medicine, art, culture, and how we even live our lives. At eight years old, I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas, and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet. (Laughter) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories. I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before then. I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did, even my business. I would find different fabrics around the house, and say, \"This could be a scarf or a hat,\" and I had all these ideas for designs. I noticed when I wore my creations, people would stop me and say, \"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?\" And I thought, I can start my own business.Now I didn't have any business plans at only eight years old. I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back. My mom taught me how to sew, and on my back porch, I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon, and I would write down the names and the price of each item. I started making more items like hats, scarves and bags. Soon, my items began selling all over the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and more.Now, I had a lot to learn about my business, like branding and marketing, staying engaged with my customers, and seeing what sold the most and the least. Soon, my business really started to take off. Then one day, Forbes magazine  contacted me when I was 10 years old. (Laughter) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article.Now a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly? I've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little. My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment. I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet, so I started doing my own research, and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed, there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment. For example, the grinding of materials, or the dumping of dried powder materials. These actions can pollute the air, making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it. So when I started my business, I knew two things: All of my items had to be eco-friendly, and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations. (Applause) I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business, but also a sustainable future. I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow.We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and that makes me even more passionate to save it. But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. It takes to get it through your hearts, because when you get it through your heart, that is when movements are sparked. That is when opportunities and innovation are created, and that is why ideas come to life.Thank you, and peace and blessings.(Applause)Thank you.

They would come into the emergency room with what the police would call \"a lovers' quarrel,\" and I would see a woman who was beaten, I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and swollen eyes. And as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera, we would take her picture, we would wait 90 seconds, and we would give her the photograph. And she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court. We were making what was invisible visible.I've been doing this for 30 years. I've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children. And for all those years, I've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable, that it is learned, and if it's learned, it can be un-learned, and it can be prevented. (Applause)Why do I believe this? Because it's true. It is absolutely true. Between 1993 and 2010, domestic violence among adult women in the United States has gone down by 64 percent, and that is great news. (Applause)Sixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there? Our eyes were wide open. Thirty years ago, women were beaten, they were stalked, they were raped, and no one talked about it. There was no justice. And as an activist, that was not good enough. And so step one on this journey is we organized, and we created this extraordinary underground network of amazing women who opened shelters, and if they didn't open a shelter, they opened their home so that women and children could be safe. And you know what else we did? We had bake sales, we had car washes, and we did everything we could do to fundraise, and then at one point we said, you know, it's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people's lives. Right? (Applause)And so, step number two, we knew we needed to change the laws. And so we went to Washington, and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation. And I remember walking through the halls of the U.S. Capitol, and I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose, and I couldn't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation. I was probably 30 and naive. But I heard about a congressman who had a very, very different point of view. Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation? He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. Ladies and gentlemen, that was in 1984 in the United States, and I wish I had Twitter. (Laughter)Ten years later, after lots of hard work, we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act, which is a life-changing act that has saved so many lives. (Applause) Thank you. I was proud to be part of that work, and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities.And you know what else it did? It collected data. And I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data. In fact, I am a data nerd. I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here. I am a data nerd, and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar, that the program works, and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.And I also want to say one other thing: We are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters. It is about economic empowerment for women, it is about healing kids who are hurt, and it is about prevention with a capital P.And so, step number three on this journey: We know, if we're going to keep making this progress, we're going to have to turn up the volume, we're going to have to increase the visibility, and we're going to have to engage the public. And so knowing that, we went to the Advertising Council, and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign. And we looked around the world to Canada and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa, and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence. Take a look at one of our spots.(Video) Man: Where's dinner?Woman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so\u2014Man: What is this? Pizza. Woman: If you had just called me, I would have known\u2014Man: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza? Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud. Please don't\u2014Let go of me!Man: Get in the kitchen! Woman: No! Help!Man: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman)That's what hurts! That's what hurts! (Breaking glass)Woman: Help me![\"Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse?\"]Esta Soler: As we were in the process of releasing this campaign, O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his wife and her friend. We learned that he had a long history of domestic violence. The media became fixated. The story of domestic violence went from the back page, but actually from the no-page, to the front page. Our ads blanketed the airwaves, and women, for the first time, started to tell their stories. Movements are about moments, and we seized this moment. And let me just put this in context. Before 1980, do you have any idea how many articles were in The New York Times on domestic violence? I'll tell you: 158. And in the 2000s, over 7,000. We were obviously making a difference.But we were still missing a critical element. So, step four: We needed to engage men. We couldn't solve this problem with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines. And I already told you I'm a data nerd. National polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation. So we wondered, how can we include men? How can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls? And a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said, \"You want men to talk about violence against women and girls. Men don't talk.\" (Laughter) I apologize to the men in the audience. I know you do. But he said, \"Do you know what they do do? They do talk to their kids. They talk to their kids as parents, as coaches.\" And that's what we did. We met men where they were at and we built a program. And then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life. And he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships. And all of a sudden, he looked at the back of the room, and he saw his daughter, and he called out his daughter's name, Michaela, and he said, \"Michaela, come up here.\" And she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy, and she got up there, and he said, \"Sit down next to me.\" She sat right down next to him. He gave her this big hug, and he said, \"People ask me why I do this work. I do this work because I'm her dad, and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her.\" And as a parent, I get it. I get it, knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so under-reported. We've done a lot for adult women. We've got to do a better job for our kids. We just do. We have to. (Applause)We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. Technology has been our friend. The mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women, and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube and all the social media helps us organize and tell our story in a powerful way. And so those of you in this audience who have helped build those applications and those platforms, as an organizer, I say, thank you very much. Really. I clap for you. (Applause)I'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life, the Optimist Club. You can't make that one up. And it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my DNA. I have been doing this work for over 30 years, and I am convinced, now more than ever, in the capacity of human beings to change. I believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality, and I also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition.

Now, how to photograph it ...", "duration": "584", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_berkenstock_the_world_is_one_big_dataset_now_how_to_photograph_it", "transcript": "Five years ago, I was a Ph.D. student living two lives. In one, I used NASA supercomputers to design next-generation spacecraft, and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies. As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses, mostly of facilities, industrial facilities around the world. And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together. And one day, I was thinking about how all data has a location, and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face. Although I was a satellite engineer, I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery in my work.Now, like most of us, I'd been online, I'd see my house, so I thought, I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up some of these facilities. And what I found really surprised me. The pictures that I was finding were years out of date, and because of that, it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today. But I was intrigued. I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today, but there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis. How much oil is stored in all of China? How much corn is being produced? How many ships are in all of our world's ports? Now, in theory, all of these questions could be answered by imagery, but not if it's old. And if this data was so valuable, then how come I couldn't get my hands on more recent pictures?So the story begins over 50 years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites. And today, there's a handful of the great, great grandchildren of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and I see on a daily basis comes. During this period, launching things into space, just the rocket to get the satellite up there, has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, and that's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do, you cram as much functionality in there as possible. All of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive, now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy. Because they are so expensive, there aren't very many of them. Because there aren't very many of them, the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old.I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally, but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected, some friends and I put together a dataset of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between 2000 and 2010. As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world are barely seen, less than once a year, and even the areas that are seen most frequently, those in red, are seen at best once a quarter. Now as aerospace engineering grad students, this chart cried out to us as a challenge. Why do these things have to be so expensive? Does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets? Wasn't there a way to build a smaller, simpler, new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging?I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites, but fortunately we had help. In the late 1990s, a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space. This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites. This dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of 100, and suddenly we could afford to experiment, to take a little bit of risk, and to realize a lot of innovation. And a new generation of engineers and scientists, mostly out of universities, began launching these very small, breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats. And these were built with electronics obtained from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.Now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and I began a series of sketches of our own satellite design. And I can't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things, but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset, of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy, of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found, it just seemed boring to go work on anything else.And so we moved into a cramped, windowless office in Palo Alto, and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab. The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing. In space, size drives cost, and we had worked with these very small, breadbox-sized satellites in school, but as we began to better understand the laws of physics, we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited, because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture you can take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope, and these satellites had a very small, very constrained volume. And we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this. Although this was the low-cost option, quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable. So about three or four weeks later, we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed, and they told us that back in the 1970s, the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff \u2014 that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution, being able to see objects one meter in size, they had found that they could not just get very high-quality images, but get a lot of them at an affordable price. From our own computer simulations, we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy, for the first time, being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis, while conveniently still not being able to see individuals. We had found our compromise. We would have to build something larger than the original breadbox, now more like a mini-fridge, but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck. So now we had our constraint. The laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum-sized telescope that we could build.What came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible, basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb. The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope. Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner, similar to a Xerox machine, and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures, scanning row by row by row to build the complete image. Now people use these because they get a lot of light, which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image. The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing. You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target from over 600 miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second, which requires an awesome degree of complexity. So instead, we turned to a new generation of video sensors, originally created for use in night vision goggles. Instead of taking a single, high quality image, we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames, but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high-quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground, at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system. And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well, and day by day, our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units.A few short weeks ago, we packed up SkySat 1, put our signatures on it, and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth. Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks. And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect.So why do all of this? Why build these satellites? Well, it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency, and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come. We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier, and beyond economic data, unlocking the human story, moment by moment. For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid, it just doesn't get much better than that.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1919, "subtitle":

best once a quarter.\n\n00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.513\nNow as aerospace engineering grad students,\n\n00:03:20.513 --> 00:03:23.941\nthis chart cried out to us as a challenge.\n\n00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:27.396\nWhy do these things have to be so expensive?\n\n00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:30.131\nDoes a single satellite really have to cost\n\n00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:34.894\nthe equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?\n\n00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:37.057\nWasn't there a way to build a smaller,\n\n00:03:37.057 --> 00:03:40.229\nsimpler, new satellite design that could enable\n\n00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.247\nmore timely imaging?\n\n00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:45.698\nI realize that it does sound a little bit crazy\n\n00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:47.209\nthat we were going to go out and just\n\n00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.056\nbegin designing satellites,\n\n00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:51.019\nbut fortunately we had help.\n\n00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.954\nIn the late 1990s, a couple of professors\n\n00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:57.435\nproposed a concept for radically reducing the price\n\n00:03:57.435 --> 00:03:59.207\nof putting things in space.\n\n00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:01.318\nThis was hitchhiking small satellites\n\n00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:04.334\nalongside much larger satellites.\n\n00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:07.243\nThis dropped the cost of putting objects up there\n\n00:04:07.243 --> 00:04:09.241\nby over a factor of 100,\n\n00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:12.327\nand suddenly we could afford to experiment,\n\n00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:13.795\nto take a little bit of risk,\n\n00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.061\nand to realize a lot of innovation.\n\n00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.150\nAnd a new generation of engineers and scientists,\n\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.749\nmostly out of universities,\n\n00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.092\nbegan launching these very small,\n\n00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:25.683\nbreadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.\n\n00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:28.086\nAnd these were built with electronics obtained\n\n00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:31.984\nfrom RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.\n\n00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:34.824\nNow it was using the lessons\nlearned from these early missions\n\n00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:37.519\nthat my friends and I began a series of sketches\n\n00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.208\nof our own satellite design.\n\n00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:41.992\nAnd I can't remember a specific day\n\n00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:43.852\nwhere we made a conscious decision\n\n00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:46.487\nthat we were actually going to\ngo out and build these things,\n\n00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:48.917\nbut once we got that idea in our minds\n\n00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.078\nof the world as a dataset,\n\n00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:53.568\nof being able to capture millions of data points\n\n00:04:53.568 --> 00:04:56.621\non a daily basis describing the global economy,\n\n00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.141\nof being able to unearth billions of connections\n\n00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:02.306\nbetween them that had never before been found,\n\n00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:03.954\nit just seemed boring\n\n00:05:03.954 --> 00:05:06.861\nto go work on anything else.\n\n00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:09.834\nAnd so we moved into a cramped,\n\n00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:12.813\nwindowless office in Palo Alto,\n\n00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.780\nand began working to take our design\n\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.718\nfrom the drawing board into the lab.\n\n00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:20.376\nThe first major question we had to tackle\n\n00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:22.710\nwas just how big to build this thing.\n\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.893\nIn space, size drives cost,\n\n00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:27.906\nand we had worked with these very small,\n\n00:05:27.906 --> 00:05:30.000\nbreadbox-sized satellites in school,\n\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.551\nbut as we began to better\nunderstand the laws of physics,\n\n00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:34.673\nwe found that the quality of pictures\n\n00:05:34.673 --> 00:05:37.757\nthose satellites could take was very limited,\n\n00:05:37.757 --> 00:05:39.461\nbecause the laws of physics dictate\n\n00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.567\nthat the best picture you\ncan take through a telescope\n\n00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:44.806\nis a function of the diameter of that telescope,\n\n00:05:44.806 --> 00:05:46.468\nand these satellites had a very small,\n\n00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:48.174\nvery constrained volume.\n\n00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:49.969\nAnd we found that the best picture we would\n\n00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.454\nhave been able to get looked something like this.\n\n00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:54.699\nAlthough this was the low-cost option,\n\n00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.372\nquite frankly it was just too blurry\n\n00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:59.941\nto see the things that make\nsatellite imagery valuable.\n\n00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:02.087\nSo about three or four weeks later,\n\n00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:04.904\nwe met a group of engineers randomly\n\n00:06:04.904 --> 00:06:06.545\nwho had worked on the first\n\n00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:08.986\nprivate imaging satellite ever developed,\n\n00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:11.104\nand they told us that back in the 1970s,\n\n00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.286\nthe U.S. government had found a powerful\n\n00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:14.929\noptimal tradeoff --\n\n00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:18.017\nthat in taking pictures at right\nabout one meter resolution,\n\n00:06:18.017 --> 00:06:20.901\nbeing able to see objects one meter in size,\n\n00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.592\nthey had found that they could not\njust get very high-quality images,\n\n00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.485\nbut get a lot of them at an affordable price.\n\n00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.461\nFrom our own computer simulations,\n\n00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:30.466\nwe quickly found that one meter really was\n\n00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:32.230\nthe minimum viable product\n\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.309\nto be able to see the drivers of our global economy,\n\n00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:36.870\nfor the first time, being able to count\n\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.591\nthe ships and cars and shipping\ncontainers and trucks\n\n00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.415\nthat move around our world on a daily basis,\n\n00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:46.219\nwhile conveniently still not\nbeing able to see individuals.\n\n00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:47.840\nWe had found our compromise.\n\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.444\nWe would have to build something larger\n\n00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:51.007\nthan the original breadbox,\n\n00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:52.658\nnow more like a mini-fridge,\n\n00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:55.419\nbut we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.\n\n00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.043\nSo now we had our constraint.\n\n00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.800\nThe laws of physics dictated\n\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.124\nthe absolute minimum-sized\ntelescope that we could build.\n\n00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:06.178\nWhat came next was making the rest of the satellite\n\n00:07:06.178 --> 00:07:07.919\nas small and as simple as possible,\n\n00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.571\nbasically a flying telescope with four walls\n\n00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.512\nand a set of electronics smaller than a phone book\n\n00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:16.950\nthat used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.\n\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.850\nThe big challenge became actually taking\n\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.048\nthe pictures through that telescope.\n\n00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:24.092\nTraditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,\n\n00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:25.853\nsimilar to a Xerox machine,\n\n00:07:25.853 --> 00:07:28.253\nand as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,\n\n00:07:28.253 --> 00:07:30.449\nscanning row by row by row\n\n00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.124\nto build the complete image.\n\n00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:35.128\nNow people use these because they get a lot of light,\n\n00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:36.959\nwhich means less of the noise you see\n\n00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:39.710\nin a low-cost cell phone image.\n\n00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.071\nThe problem with them is they require\n\n00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:44.311\nvery sophisticated pointing.\n\n00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:46.857\nYou have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target\n\n00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:48.609\nfrom over 600 miles away\n\n00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:50.841\nwhile moving at more than\nseven kilometers a second,\n\n00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:53.590\nwhich requires an awesome degree of complexity.\n\n00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.027\nSo instead, we turned to a new\ngeneration of video sensors,\n\n00:07:57.027 --> 00:08:00.118\noriginally created for use in night vision goggles.\n\n00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:03.017\nInstead of taking a single, high quality image,\n\n00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:04.404\nwe could take a videostream\n\n00:08:04.404 --> 00:08:07.327\nof individually noisier frames,\n\n00:08:07.327 --> 00:08:09.071\nbut then we could recombine\n\n00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:10.537\nall of those frames together\n\n00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:12.533\ninto very high-quality images\n\n00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:15.126\nusing sophisticated pixel processing techniques\n\n00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:16.647\nhere on the ground,\n\n00:08:16.647 --> 00:08:19.784\nat a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.\n\n00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:20.937\nAnd we applied this technique\n\n00:08:20.937 --> 00:08:23.911\nto many of the other systems on the satellite as well,\n\n00:08:23.911 --> 00:08:26.751\nand day by day, our design evolved\n\n00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:30.240\nfrom CAD to prototypes\n\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.128\nto production units.\n\n00:08:33.128 --> 00:08:34.785\nA few short weeks ago,\n\n00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:36.636\nwe packed up SkySat 1,\n\n00:08:36.636 --> 00:08:38.409\nput our signatures on it,\n\n00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.632\nand waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.\n\n00:08:40.632 --> 00:08:44.113\nToday, it's sitting in its final launch configuration\n\n00:08:44.113 --> 00:08:47.174\nready to blast off in a few short weeks.\n\n00:08:47.174 --> 00:08:49.516\nAnd soon, we'll turn our attention to launching\n\n00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:52.547\na constellation of 24 or more of these satellites\n\n00:08:52.547 --> 00:08:55.097\nand beginning to build the scalable analytics\n\n00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:57.436\nthat will allow us to unearth the insights\n\n00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:00.625\nin the petabytes of data we will collect.\n\n00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:04.598\nSo why do all of this? Why build these satellites?\n\n00:09:04.598 --> 00:09:07.209\nWell, it turns out imaging satellites\n\n00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:10.919\nhave a unique ability to provide global transparency,\n\n00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:13.545\nand providing that transparency on a timely basis\n\n00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:16.956\nis simply an idea whose time has come.\n\n00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:20.479\nWe see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier,\n\n00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:22.243\nand beyond economic data,\n\n00:09:22.243 --> 00:09:25.844\nunlocking the human story, moment by moment.\n\n00:09:25.844 --> 00:09:27.407\nFor a data scientist\n\n00:09:27.407 --> 00:09:30.157\nthat just happened to go to space camp as a kid,\n\n00:09:30.157 --> 00:09:32.872\nit just doesn't get much better than that.\n\n00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:35.087\nThank you.\n\n00:09:35.087 --> 00:09:39.221\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How architectural innovations migrate across borders", "duration": "794", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/teddy_cruz_how_architectural_innovations_migrate_across_borders", "transcript": "The urban explosion of the last years of economic boom also produced dramatic marginalization, resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world. This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today's urban crisis. But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental. It's particularly a cultural crisis, a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing, unable to challenge the oil-hungry, selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption, from southern California to New York to Dubai. So I just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings and, in fact, depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations, that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance, but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana-San Diego border region, which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect.This is the wall, the border wall, that separates San Diego and Tijuana, Latin America and the United States, a physical emblem of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities, jurisdictions and resources across the world. In this border region, we find some of the wealthiest real estate, as I once found in the edges of San Diego, barely 20 minutes away from some of the poorest  settlements in Latin America. And while these two cities have the same population, San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana in the last decades, immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density, which are at the center of today's discussion about environmental sustainability. So I've been arguing in the last years that, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of San Diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability, that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization.What do I mean by the informal in this case? I'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization. I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom-up, whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana that build themselves, in fact, with the waste of San Diego, or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades.So I've been interested as an artist in the measuring, the observation, of many of the trans-border informal flows across this border: in one direction, from south to north, the flow of immigrants into the United States, and from north to south the flow of waste from southern California into Tijuana. I'm referring to the recycling of these old post-war bungalows that Mexican contractors bring to the border as American developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades. So these are houses waiting to cross the border. Not only people cross the border here, but entire chunks of one city move to the next, and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames, they leave the first floor to become the second to be in-filled with more house, with a small business. This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice. But not only houses, also small debris from one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana. Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls. But look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency. They have figured out how to peel off the tire, how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall. Or the garage doors that are brought from San Diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of Tijuana.So while, as an architect, this is a very compelling thing to witness, this creative intelligence, I also want to keep myself in check. I don't want to romanticize poverty. I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness, that informality here, the informal, is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists, that this is about a bottom-up urbanization that performs. See here, buildings are not important just for their looks, but, in fact, they are important for what they can do. They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources.So while waste flows southbound, people go north in search of dollars, and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the United States, particularly in San Diego. And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization \u2014 I mean, on steroids \u2014 with the small programs, social and economic. I'm referring to how immigrants, when they come to these neighborhoods, they begin to alter the one-dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems, as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage, or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family. This socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new, inclusive and more equitable land use policies. So many stories emerge from these dynamics of alteration of space, such as \"the informal Buddha,\" which tells the story of a small house that saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico, but it was retrofitted in the end into a Buddhist temple, and in so doing, this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small, or a micro, socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.So these action neighborhoods, as I call them, really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do, in fact, with belonging to the nation-state, and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city.As an artist, I've been interested, in fact, in the visualization of citizenship, the gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories, in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces. This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night, a few months ago, decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park. With shovels in hand, they started to dig. Two weeks later, the police stopped them. They barricaded the place, and the teenagers were evicted, and the teenagers decided to fight back, not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process. The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space. They found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under Caltrans territoy. Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway, so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them. They were lucky, they said, because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality. They were also lucky, they said, because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction, between port authority, airport authority, two city districts, and a review board. All these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space. With this knowledge, these teenagers as skaters confronted the city. They came to the city attorney's office. The city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO, and of course they didn't know what an NGO was. They had to talk to their friends in Seattle who had gone through the same experience. And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise, to organize budgets, to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city, expanding it to other categories. At the end, the teenagers won the case with that evidence, and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway.Now for many of you, this story might seem trivial or naive. For me as an architect, it has become a fundamental narrative, because it begins to teach me that this micro-community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long-term sustainability. They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border, they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool, because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city. In that act, that informal, bottom-up act of transgression, really began to trickle up to transform top-down policy.Now this journey from the bottom-up to the transformation of the top-down is where I find hope today. And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations with space and with policy in many cities in the world, in primarily the urgency of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance, social organization, and infrastructure, really is at the center of the new formation of democratic politics of the urban. It is, in fact, this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city. I want to say this and emphasize it, because this is the only way I see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

tonight\n\n00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:46.132\nby suggesting that this urban crisis\n\n00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:50.012\nis not only economic or environmental.\n\n00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:52.910\nIt's

really want to share with you a reflection\n\n00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:23.240\nthat the future of cities today\n\n00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:25.947\ndepends less on buildings\n\n00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:28.362\nand, in fact, depends more\n\n00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:33.112\non the fundamental reorganization\nof socioeconomic relations,\n\n00:01:33.112 --> 00:01:35.116\nthat the best ideas in the

abundance,\n\n00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:48.004\nbut in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity\n\n00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.844\nfrom which an urgent imagination\n\n00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:54.868\ncan really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.\n\n00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:58.448\nAnd let me illustrate what I mean\n\n00:01:58.448 --> 00:02:02.353\nby understanding or engaging sites of conflict\n\n00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:06.434\nas harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you\n\n00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:08.967\nto the Tijuana-San Diego border region,\n\n00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:13.172\nwhich has been the laboratory to\nrethink my practice as an architect.\n\n00:02:13.172 --> 00:02:15.684\nThis is the wall, the border wall,\n\n00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:18.195\nthat separates San Diego and Tijuana,\n\n00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:21.036\nLatin America and the United States,\n\n00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:23.073\na physical emblem\n\n00:02:23.073 --> 00:02:25.723\nof

00:02:33.802\nand resources across the world.\n\n00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:36.505\nIn this border region, we find\n\n00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:38.922\nsome of the wealthiest real estate,\n\n00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:41.389\nas I once found in the edges of San Diego,\n\n00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.613\nbarely 20 minutes away\n\n00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:47.739\nfrom some of the poorest \nsettlements in Latin America.\n\n00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.102\nAnd while these two cities have the same population,\n\n00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:54.938\nSan Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana\n\n00:02:54.938 -->

00:03:03.885\nbetween sprawl and density,\n\n00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.876\nwhich are at the center of today's discussion\n\n00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:08.704\nabout environmental sustainability.\n\n00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:11.436\nSo I've been arguing in the last years\n\n00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:15.141\nthat, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot\n\n00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:16.802\nto the sprawls of San Diego\n\n00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:20.332\nwhen it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,\n\n00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:22.751\nthat we should pay attention and learn\n\n00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.064\nfrom the many migrant communities\n\n00:03:25.064 --> 00:03:27.579\non both sides of this border wall\n\n00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.916\nso that we can translate

just talking about\n\n00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:41.581\nthe compendium of social practices of adaptation\n\n00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:44.420\nthat enable many of these migrant communities\n\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.974\nto transgress imposed political and economic recipes\n\n00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:50.527\nof urbanization.\n\n00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:53.777\nI'm talking simply about the creative

in fact,\nwith the waste of San Diego,\n\n00:04:03.093 --> 00:04:05.851\nor the many migrant neighborhoods\nin Southern California\n\n00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:08.927\nthat have begun to be retrofitted with difference\n\n00:04:08.927 --> 00:04:10.584\nin the last decades.\n\n00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.792\nSo I've been interested as an artist\n\n00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:15.376\nin the measuring, the observation,\n\n00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:17.648\nof many of the trans-border informal flows\n\n00:04:17.648 --> 00:04:19.338\nacross this border:\n\n00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:21.775\nin one direction, from south to north,\n\n00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:24.368\nthe flow of immigrants into the United States,\n\n00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:27.377\nand from north to south the flow of waste\n\n00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:30.408\nfrom southern California into Tijuana.\n\n00:04:30.408 --> 00:04:32.676\nI'm referring to the recycling\n\n00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:36.128\nof these old post-war bungalows\n\n00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:39.587\nthat Mexican contractors bring to the border\n\n00:04:39.587 --> 00:04:42.432\nas American developers are disposing of them\n\n00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:45.000\nin the process of building a more inflated version\n\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.076\nof suburbia in the last decades.\n\n00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:49.991\nSo these are houses waiting to cross the border.\n\n00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.343\nNot only people cross the border here,\n\n00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:55.610\nbut entire chunks of one city move to the next,\n\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.504\nand when these houses are placed\non top of these steel frames,\n\n00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:02.081\nthey leave the first floor to become the second\n\n00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.135\nto be in-filled with more house,\n\n00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:05.793\nwith a small business.\n\n00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:08.670\nThis layering of spaces and economies\n\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.952\nis very interesting to notice.\n\n00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:13.467\nBut not only houses, also small debris\n\n00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:15.814\nfrom one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.\n\n00:05:15.814 --> 00:05:18.200\nProbably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires\n\n00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.829\nthat are used in the slums to build retaining walls.\n\n00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:23.182\nBut look at what people have done here in conditions\n\n00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:25.410\nof socioeconomic emergency.\n\n00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.571\nThey have figured out how to peel off the tire,\n\n00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.936\nhow to thread it and interlock it\n\n00:05:30.936 --> 00:05:35.064\nto construct a more efficient retaining wall.\n\n00:05:35.064 --> 00:05:38.276\nOr the garage doors that are brought\n\n00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:40.784\nfrom San Diego in trucks\n\n00:05:40.784 --> 00:05:45.513\nto become the new skin of emergency housing\n\n00:05:45.513 --> 00:05:47.352\nin many of these slums\n\n00:05:47.352 --> 00:05:49.682\nsurrounding the edges of Tijuana.\n\n00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.098\nSo while, as an architect,\n\n00:05:51.098 --> 00:05:53.025\nthis is a very compelling thing to witness,\n\n00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:54.719\nthis creative intelligence,\n\n00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.732\nI also want to keep myself in check.\n\n00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:58.768\nI don't want to romanticize poverty.\n\n00:05:58.768 --> 00:06:00.759\nI just want to suggest\n\n00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.900\nthat this informal urbanization\n\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.499\nis not just the image of precariousness,\n\n00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.581\nthat informality here, the informal,\n\n00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:14.111\nis really a set of socioeconomic\nand political procedures\n\n00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.820\nthat we could translate as artists,\n\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.165\nthat this is about a bottom-up urbanization\n\n00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:20.690\nthat performs.\n\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.516\nSee here, buildings are not important\n\n00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.479\njust for their looks,\n\n00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.920\nbut, in fact, they are important for what they can do.\n\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.019\nThey truly perform as they transform through time\n\n00:06:32.034 --> 00:06:34.182\nand as communities negotiate\n\n00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:37.691\nthe spaces and boundaries and resources.\n\n00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:40.812\nSo while waste flows southbound,\n\n00:06:40.812 --> 00:06:43.340\npeople go north in search of dollars,\n\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.875\nand most of my research has had to do\n\n00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:49.770\nwith the impact of immigration\n\n00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.244\nin the alteration of the homogeneity\n\n00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:54.570\nof many neighborhoods in the United States,\n\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.534\nparticularly in San Diego.\n\n00:06:56.534 --> 00:06:58.919\nAnd I'm talking about how this begins to suggest\n\n00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.572\nthat the future of Southern California\n\n00:07:01.572 --> 00:07:04.095\ndepends on the retrofitting\n\n00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:07.302\nof the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids --\n\n00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.790\nwith the small programs,\n\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.566\nsocial and economic.\n\n00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:13.671\nI'm referring to how immigrants,\n\n00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:15.469\nwhen they come to these neighborhoods,\n\n00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:18.520\nthey begin to alter the one-dimensionality\n\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.502\nof parcels and properties\n\n00:07:20.502 --> 00:07:24.889\ninto more socially and\neconomically complex systems,\n\n00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.626\nas they begin to plug an\ninformal economy into a garage,\n\n00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.940\nor as they build an illegal granny flat\n\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.442\nto support an extended family.\n\n00:07:33.442 --> 00:07:38.517\nThis socioeconomic entrepreneurship\n\n00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:41.620\non the ground within these neighborhoods\n\n00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.166\nreally begins to suggest ways of translating that\n\n00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:49.313\ninto new, inclusive and more equitable\n\n00:07:49.313 --> 00:07:51.352\nland use policies.\n\n00:07:51.352 --> 00:07:54.083\nSo many stories emerge from these dynamics\n\n00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.944\nof alteration of space,\n\n00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.792\nsuch as &amp;quot;the informal Buddha,&amp;quot;\n\n00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:01.365\nwhich tells the story of a small house\n\n00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:04.366\nthat saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,\n\n00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:06.370\nbut it was retrofitted in the end\n\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.620\ninto a Buddhist temple,\n\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.849\nand in so doing,\n\n00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:13.105\nthis small house transforms or mutates\n\n00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:14.803\nfrom a singular dwelling\n\n00:08:14.803 --> 00:08:17.625\ninto a small, or a micro, socioeconomic\n\n00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:21.581\nand cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.\n\n00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:24.328\nSo these action neighborhoods, as I call them,\n\n00:08:24.328 --> 00:08:26.356\nreally become the inspiration\n\n00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:29.752\nto imagine other interpretations of citizenship\n\n00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:31.932\nthat have less to do, in fact,\n\n00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:33.914\nwith belonging to the nation-state,\n\n00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:37.760\nand more with upholding the notion of citizenship\n\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.654\nas a creative act\n\n00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:42.505\nthat reorganizes institutional protocols\n\n00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.835\nin the spaces of the city.\n\n00:08:44.835 --> 00:08:47.690\nAs an artist, I've been interested, in

order to narrativize the relationship\n\n00:08:57.052 --> 00:09:00.182\nbetween social processes and spaces.\n\n00:09:00.182 --> 00:09:03.301\nThis is a story of a group of teenagers\n\n00:09:03.301

skateboard park.\n\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.511\nWith shovels in hand, they started to dig.\n\n00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.368\nTwo weeks later, the police stopped them.\n\n00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:20.069\nThey barricaded the place,\n\n00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:22.021\nand the teenagers were evicted,\n\n00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:24.734\nand the teenagers decided to fight back,\n\n00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:27.201\nnot with bank cards or slogans\n\n00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:29.954\nbut with constructing a critical process.\n\n00:09:29.954 --> 00:09:32.669\nThe first thing they did was to recognize\n\n00:09:32.669 --> 00:09:35.649\nthe specificity of political jurisdiction\n\n00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:38.376\ninscribed in that empty space.\n\n00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:40.454\nThey found out that they had been lucky\n\n00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.268\nbecause they had not begun to dig\n\n00:09:42.268 --> 00:09:44.651\nunder Caltrans territoy.\n\n00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:47.883\nCaltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,\n\n00:09:47.883 --> 00:09:50.448\nso it would have been very\ndifficult to negotiate with them.\n\n00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:52.328\nThey were lucky, they said, because they began\n\n00:09:52.328 --> 00:09:54.735\nto dig under an arm of the freeway\n\n00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:56.998\nthat belongs to the local municipality.\n\n00:09:56.998 --> 00:09:58.897\nThey were also lucky, they said,\n\n00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:00.635\nbecause they began to dig in a sort of\n\n00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:02.977\nBermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,\n\n00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:06.454\nbetween port authority, airport authority,\n\n00:10:06.454 --> 00:10:09.267\ntwo city districts, and a review board.\n\n00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:12.045\nAll these red lines are the invisible\n\n00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:14.623\npolitical institutions that were inscribed\n\n00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:17.657\nin that leftover empty space.\n\n00:10:17.657 --> 00:10:20.612\nWith this knowledge, these teenagers\n\n00:10:20.612 --> 00:10:23.295\nas skaters confronted the city.\n\n00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:25.449\nThey came to the city attorney's office.\n\n00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:27.398\nThe city attorney told them\n\n00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:29.294\nthat in order to continue the negotiation\n\n00:10:29.294 --> 00:10:31.237\nthey had to become an NGO,\n\n00:10:31.237 --> 00:10:33.498\nand of course they didn't know what an NGO was.\n\n00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:36.437\nThey had to talk to their friends in Seattle\n\n00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:38.348\nwho had gone through the same experience.\n\n00:10:38.348 --> 00:10:40.532\nAnd they began to realize the necessity\n\n00:10:40.532 --> 00:10:42.871\nto organize themselves even deeper\n\n00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:47.005\nand began to fundraise, to organize budgets,\n\n00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:49.329\nto really be aware of all the knowledge\n\n00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:52.562\nembedded in the urban code in San Diego\n\n00:10:52.562 --> 00:10:54.780\nso that they could begin to redefine\n\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.600\nthe very meaning of public space in the city,\n\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.092\nexpanding it to other categories.\n\n00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:03.727\nAt the end, the teenagers won the case\n\n00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:06.200\nwith that evidence, and they were able\n\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.815\nto construct their skateboard park\n\n00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:10.425\nunder that freeway.\n\n00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:12.870\nNow for many of you, this story\n\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.110\nmight seem trivial or naive.\n\n00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.059\nFor me as an architect, it has become\n\n00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:19.397\na fundamental narrative,\n\n00:11:19.397 --> 00:11:21.250\nbecause it begins to teach me\n\n00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.205\nthat this micro-community\n\n00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:26.697\nnot only designed another category of public space\n\n00:11:26.697 --> 00:11:30.502\nbut they also designed the socioeconomic protocols\n\n00:11:30.502 --> 00:11:33.599\nthat were necessary to be inscribed in that space\n\n00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:36.560\nfor its long-term sustainability.\n\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.045\nThey also taught me\n\n00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:40.080\nthat similar to the migrant communities\n\n00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.609\non both sides of the border,\n\n00:11:41.609 --> 00:11:45.326\nthey engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,\n\n00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:47.130\nbecause they had to produce a process\n\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.747\nthat enabled them to reorganize resources\n\n00:11:50.747 --> 00:11:52.581\nand the politics of the city.\n\n00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:55.106\nIn that act, that informal,\n\n00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:57.361\nbottom-up act of transgression,\n\n00:11:57.361 --> 00:11:59.510\nreally began to trickle up\n\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.628\nto transform top-down policy.\n\n00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:07.131\nNow this journey from the bottom-up\n\n00:12:07.131 --> 00:12:09.311\nto the transformation of the top-down\n\n00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:11.829\nis where I find hope today.\n\n00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:16.078\nAnd I'm thinking of how these modest alterations\n\n00:12:16.078 --> 00:12:19.021\nwith space and with policy\n\n00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:21.046\nin many

"Intelligence \u2014 what is it? If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed, one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that \"the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.\" Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this, intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science, like Alan Turing. However, if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that [fly], you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines. And so, several years ago, I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.Let's take a step back. Let's first begin with a thought experiment. Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence, but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives, so you're able to watch the Earth over millions, even billions of years. And you observe a really strange effect. You observe that, over the course of the millennia, Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point, and that at some point, corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth. Now of course, as earthlings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves. We're trying to prevent an impact. But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that. And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.So in this program that I undertook several years ago, I looked at a variety of different threads across science, across a variety of disciplines, that were pointing, I think, towards a single, underlying mechanism for intelligence. In cosmology, for example, there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures. In game play, for example, in Go \u2014 everyone remembers in 1997 when IBM's Deep Blue beat  Garry Kasparov at chess \u2014 fewer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so, the game of Go, arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor, has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason: the best techniques right now for computers playing Go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play. Finally, in robotic motion planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks. And so, taking all of these different threads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads? Is there a single equation for intelligence?And the answer, I believe, is yes. [\"F = T \u2207 S\u03c4\"] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc\u00b2 for intelligence that I've seen. So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, tau. In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped. Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open. And so, given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this? How predictive is it? Does it predict human-level intelligence? Does it predict artificial intelligence? So I'm going to show you now a video that will, I think, demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation.(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or \"entropy,\" over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves. But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship? What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long-term entropy, but actually emerges directly from it? To find out, we developed a software engine called Entropica, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in. Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games, and even earn money trading stocks, all without being instructed to do so. Here are some examples of Entropica in action.Just like a human standing upright without falling over, here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart. This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal. It simply decided on its own to balance the pole. This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies. Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces, here we see that Entropica, again on its own initiative, was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk, representing a tool, to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position. This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture. In addition, just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task. This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields.Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains. For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself, illustrating its potential for gaming. Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected. This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care, energy, and intelligence. Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships, successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the same token, Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.Finally, here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy-low, sell-high strategy on a simulated range traded stock, successfully growing assets under management exponentially. This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance.Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation, which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action.Now, there's a profound irony here. Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot, the play \"RUR,\" there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a cybernetic revolt. The machines would rise up against us. One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse. It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world. It's quite the opposite, that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence, that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control-grabbing, rather than vice versa.Another important consequence is goal seeking. I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework? And the answer is, the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense: just like you would travel through a tunnel, a bottleneck in your future path space, in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on, or just like you would invest in a financial security, reducing your short-term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term, goal seeking emerges directly from a long-term drive to increase future freedom of action.Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together. My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1922, "subtitle":

theory that explains how,\n\n00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:41.916\nup until a certain point in time,\n\n00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:46.365\nasteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet\n\n00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:49.596\nmysteriously stop doing that.\n\n00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:53.800\nAnd so I claim that this is the same question\n\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.798\nas understanding the physical nature of intelligence.\n\n00:02:57.798 --> 00:03:01.680\nSo in this program that I\nundertook several years ago,\n\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.445\nI looked at a variety of different threads\n\n00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:07.607\nacross science, across a variety of disciplines,\n\n00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:09.499\nthat were pointing, I think,\n\n00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.047\ntowards a single, underlying mechanism\n\n00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:13.628\nfor intelligence.\n\n00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:16.174\nIn cosmology, for example,\n\n00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:18.921\nthere have been a variety of\ndifferent threads of evidence\n\n00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:22.328\nthat our universe appears to be finely tuned\n\n00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:24.481\nfor the development of intelligence,\n\n00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:26.870\nand, in particular, for the development\n\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.756\nof universal states\n\n00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:32.854\nthat maximize the diversity of possible futures.\n\n00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:35.198\nIn game play, for example, in Go --\n\n00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:38.223\neveryone remembers in 1997\n\n00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:42.174\nwhen IBM's Deep Blue beat \nGarry Kasparov at chess --\n\n00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:43.697\nfewer people are aware\n\n00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:45.715\nthat in the past 10 years or so,\n\n00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:46.913\nthe game of Go,\n\n00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:48.869\narguably a much more challenging game\n\n00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.294\nbecause it has a much higher branching factor,\n\n00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:52.996\nhas also started to succumb\n\n00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:54.861\nto computer game players\n\n00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:56.434\nfor the same reason:\n\n00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:59.234\nthe best techniques right now\nfor computers playing Go\n\n00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:02.930\nare techniques that try to maximize future options\n\n00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.944\nduring game play.\n\n00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:08.525\nFinally, in robotic motion planning,\n\n00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:10.707\nthere have been a variety of recent techniques\n\n00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:12.609\nthat have tried to take advantage\n\n00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.755\nof abilities of robots to maximize\n\n00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.261\nfuture freedom of action\n\n00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.358\nin order to accomplish complex tasks.\n\n00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:22.713\nAnd so, taking all of these different threads\n\n00:04:22.713 --> 00:04:24.335\nand putting them together,\n\n00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:26.975\nI asked, starting several years ago,\n\n00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.825\nis there an underlying mechanism for intelligence\n\n00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:31.498\nthat we can factor out\n\n00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:33.272\nof all of these different threads?\n\n00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:37.865\nIs there a single equation for intelligence?\n\n00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:41.236\nAnd the answer, I believe, is yes.\n[\"F = T \u2207 S\u03c4\"]\n\n00:04:41.236 --> 00:04:43.149\nWhat you're seeing is probably\n\n00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.443\nthe closest equivalent to an E = mc\u00b2\n\n00:04:46.443 --> 00:04:49.273\nfor intelligence that I've seen.\n\n00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:50.975\nSo what you're seeing here\n\n00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:53.644\nis a statement of correspondence\n\n00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:58.079\nthat intelligence is a force, F,\n\n00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.729\nthat acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.\n\n00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.104\nIt acts to maximize future freedom of action,\n\n00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.732\nor keep options open,\n\n00:05:06.732 --> 00:05:08.957\nwith some strength T,\n\n00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:13.734\nwith the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,\n\n00:05:13.734 --> 00:05:16.284\nup to some future time horizon, tau.\n\n00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:19.493\nIn short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.\n\n00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:22.548\nIntelligence tries to maximize\nfuture freedom of action\n\n00:05:22.548 --> 00:05:25.221\nand keep options open.\n\n00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.654\nAnd so, given this one equation,\n\n00:05:27.654 --> 00:05:30.186\nit's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?\n\n00:05:30.186 --> 00:05:31.537\nHow predictive is it?\n\n00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:33.672\nDoes it predict human-level intelligence?\n\n00:05:33.672 --> 00:05:36.490\nDoes it predict artificial intelligence?\n\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.532\nSo I'm going to show you now a video\n\n00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:41.952\nthat will, I think, demonstrate\n\n00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:44.240\nsome of the amazing applications\n\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.559\nof just this single equation.\n\n00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:48.538\n(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology\n\n00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:50.585\nhas suggested that universes that produce\n\n00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:54.066\nmore disorder, or \"entropy,\" over their lifetimes\n\n00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:56.544\nshould tend to have more favorable conditions\n\n00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:59.560\nfor the existence of intelligent\nbeings such as ourselves.\n\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.134\nBut what if that tentative cosmological connection\n\n00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:03.977\nbetween entropy and intelligence\n\n00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:05.748\nhints at a deeper relationship?\n\n00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:08.312\nWhat if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate\n\n00:06:08.312 --> 00:06:10.156\nwith the production of long-term entropy,\n\n00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:12.474\nbut actually emerges directly from it?\n\n00:06:12.474 --> 00:06:14.880\nTo find out, we developed a software engine\n\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.383\ncalled Entropica, designed to maximize\n\n00:06:17.383 --> 00:06:19.151\nthe production of long-term entropy\n\n00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:21.727\nof any system that it finds itself in.\n\n00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:23.882\nAmazingly, Entropica was able to pass\n\n00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:27.338\nmultiple animal intelligence\ntests, play human games,\n\n00:06:27.338 --> 00:06:29.484\nand even earn money trading stocks,\n\n00:06:29.484 --> 00:06:31.595\nall without being instructed to do so.\n\n00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:34.113\nHere are some examples of Entropica in action.\n\n00:06:34.113 --> 00:06:37.318\nJust like a human standing\nupright without falling over,\n\n00:06:37.318 --> 00:06:38.548\nhere we see Entropica\n\n00:06:38.548 --> 00:06:41.433\nautomatically balancing a pole using a cart.\n\n00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:43.445\nThis behavior is remarkable in part\n\n00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.776\nbecause we never gave Entropica a goal.\n\n00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:48.933\nIt simply decided on its own to balance the pole.\n\n00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:51.065\nThis balancing ability will have appliactions\n\n00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:52.462\nfor humanoid robotics\n\n00:06:52.462 --> 00:06:54.977\nand human assistive technologies.\n\n00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:56.978\nJust as some animals can use objects\n\n00:06:56.978 --> 00:06:58.420\nin their environments as tools\n\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.407\nto reach into narrow spaces,\n\n00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:02.289\nhere we see that Entropica,\n\n00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.127\nagain on its own initiative,\n\n00:07:04.127 --> 00:07:07.037\nwas able to move a large\ndisk representing an animal\n\n00:07:07.037 --> 00:07:09.382\naround so as to cause a small disk,\n\n00:07:09.382 --> 00:07:12.153\nrepresenting a tool, to reach into a confined space\n\n00:07:12.153 --> 00:07:13.690\nholding a third disk\n\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.662\nand release the third disk\nfrom its initially fixed position.\n\n00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:18.851\nThis tool use ability will have applications\n\n00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:21.210\nfor smart manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.154\nIn addition, just as some other animals\n\n00:07:23.154 --> 00:07:25.850\nare able to cooperate by pulling\nopposite ends of a rope\n\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.903\nat the same time to release food,\n\n00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:30.198\nhere we see that Entropica is able to accomplish\n\n00:07:30.198 --> 00:07:32.186\na model version of that task.\n\n00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:34.708\nThis cooperative ability has interesting implications\n\n00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:38.143\nfor economic planning and a variety of other fields.\n\n00:07:38.143 --> 00:07:40.214\nEntropica is broadly applicable\n\n00:07:40.214 --> 00:07:42.157\nto a variety of domains.\n\n00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.599\nFor example, here we see it successfully\n\n00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:47.158\nplaying a game of pong against itself,\n\n00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:49.501\nillustrating its potential for gaming.\n\n00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:51.420\nHere we see Entropica orchestrating\n\n00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.259\nnew connections on a social network\n\n00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:56.019\nwhere friends are constantly falling out of touch\n\n00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:58.875\nand successfully keeping\nthe network well connected.\n\n00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:01.173\nThis same network orchestration ability\n\n00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:03.501\nalso has applications in health care,\n\n00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.733\nenergy, and intelligence.\n\n00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:08.818\nHere we see Entropica directing the paths\n\n00:08:08.818 --> 00:08:10.304\nof a fleet of ships,\n\n00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:13.479\nsuccessfully discovering and\nutilizing the Panama Canal\n\n00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:15.937\nto globally extend its reach from the Atlantic\n\n00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:17.466\nto the Pacific.\n\n00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:19.193\nBy the same token, Entropica\n\n00:08:19.193 --> 00:08:20.813\nis broadly applicable to problems\n\n00:08:20.813 --> 00:08:26.115\nin autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.\n\n00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.161\nFinally, here we see Entropica\n\n00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:30.884\nspontaneously discovering and executing\n\n00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:32.951\na buy-low, sell-high strategy\n\n00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:35.129\non a simulated range traded stock,\n\n00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:37.460\nsuccessfully growing assets under management\n\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.884\nexponentially.\n\n00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:40.192\nThis risk management ability\n\n00:08:40.192 --> 00:08:42.679\nwill have broad applications in finance\n\n00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:46.007\nand insurance.\n\n00:08:46.007 --> 00:08:48.098\nAlex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen\n\n00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:52.490\nis that a variety of signature human intelligent\n\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.247\ncognitive behaviors\n\n00:08:54.247 --> 00:08:57.078\nsuch as tool use and walking upright\n\n00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.107\nand social cooperation\n\n00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:02.079\nall follow from a single equation,\n\n00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:04.011\nwhich drives a system\n\n00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:07.922\nto maximize its future freedom of action.\n\n00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.929\nNow, there's a profound irony here.\n\n00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:12.953\nGoing back to the beginning\n\n00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:16.226\nof the usage of the term robot,\n\n00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:19.129\nthe play \"RUR,\"\n\n00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:21.364\nthere was always a concept\n\n00:09:21.364 --> 00:09:24.590\nthat if we developed machine intelligence,\n\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.617\nthere would be a cybernetic revolt.\n\n00:09:27.617 --> 00:09:31.168\nThe machines would rise up against us.\n\n00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:33.487\nOne major consequence of this work\n\n00:09:33.487 --> 00:09:36.256\nis that maybe all of these decades,\n\n00:09:36.256 --> 00:09:39.232\nwe've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt\n\n00:09:39.232 --> 00:09:41.243\nin reverse.\n\n00:09:41.243 --> 00:09:44.522\nIt's not that machines first become intelligent\n\n00:09:44.522 --> 00:09:46.537\nand then megalomaniacal\n\n00:09:46.537 --> 00:09:48.761\nand try to take over the world.\n\n00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:50.195\nIt's quite the opposite,\n\n00:09:50.195 --> 00:09:53.101\nthat the urge to take control\n\n00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.362\nof all possible futures\n\n00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:57.480\nis a more fundamental principle\n\n00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.843\nthan that of intelligence,\n\n00:09:58.843 --> 00:10:02.543\nthat general intelligence may in fact emerge\n\n00:10:02.543 --> 00:10:06.102\ndirectly from this sort of control-grabbing,\n\n00:10:06.102 --> 00:10:10.287\nrather than vice versa.\n\n00:10:10.287 --> 00:10:14.056\nAnother important consequence is goal seeking.\n\n00:10:14.056 --> 00:10:18.416\nI'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals\n\n00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:20.036\nfollow from this sort of framework?\n\n00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.064\nAnd the answer is, the ability to seek goals\n\n00:10:23.064 --> 00:10:24.946\nwill follow directly from this\n\n00:10:24.946 --> 00:10:26.780\nin the following sense:\n\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.645\njust like you would travel through a tunnel,\n\n00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:32.150\na bottleneck in your future path space,\n\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.021\nin order to achieve many other\n\n00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.042\ndiverse objectives later on,\n\n00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:38.414\nor just like you would invest\n\n00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:40.201\nin a financial security,\n\n00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:42.438\nreducing your short-term liquidity\n\n00:10:42.438 --> 00:10:44.838\nin order to increase your wealth over the long term,\n\n00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:47.175\ngoal seeking emerges directly\n\n00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:48.904\nfrom a long-term drive\n\n00:10:48.904 --> 00:10:52.941\nto increase future freedom of action.\n\n00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:56.469\nFinally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,\n\n00:10:56.469 --> 00:11:00.141\nonce wrote that if human civilization were destroyed\n\n00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:02.034\nand you could pass only a single concept\n\n00:11:02.034 --> 00:11:03.405\non to our descendants\n\n00:11:03.405 --> 00:11:05.712\nto help them rebuild civilization,\n\n00:11:05.712 --> 00:11:07.398\nthat concept should be\n\n00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:09.250\nthat all matter around us\n\n00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.573\nis made out of tiny elements\n\n00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:14.081\nthat attract each other when they're far apart\n\n00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:17.411\nbut repel each other when they're close together.\n\n00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:19.192\nMy equivalent of that statement\n\n00:11:19.192 --> 00:11:20.460\nto pass on to descendants\n\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.172\nto help them build artificial intelligences\n\n00:11:23.172 --> 00:11:26.121\nor to help them understand human intelligence,\n\n00:11:26.121 --> 00:11:27.388\nis the following:\n\n00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:29.441\nIntelligence should be viewed\n\n00:11:29.441 --> 00:11:30.854\nas a physical process\n\n00:11:30.854 --> 00:11:33.819\nthat tries to maximize future freedom of action\n\n00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:37.435\nand avoid constraints in its own future.\n\n00:11:37.435 --> 00:11:38.793\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:42.793\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Art that craves your attention", "duration": "536", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/aparna_rao_art_that_craves_your_attention", "transcript": "Hi. So today, I'd like to share some works in progress. Since we are still realizing these works, we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery, still. So I'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we're looking for through each of the works.So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes. A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room, and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall. Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer, they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry. (Laughter) So this is the sketch of the two states. One is total chaos. The other is absolute order. And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state. This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions. One is the altar tablets of the 15th century, and the other is about 100 years ago, Malevich's abstract compositions. So I'm just going to take you to a video. To give you a sense of scale, the largest panel is about two meters high. That's about this much.  And the smallest one is an A4. So a viewer enters the space, and they snap to attention. And after a while, if the viewer continues to remain in the space, the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again, until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement, when they will again snap to attention. (Laughter) So here it appears as if it's the viewer that's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels, but it could also be the other way around, that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant.So this brings me to a quieter, small work called Handheld. The viewer sees a piece of paper that's mounted on the far end of the wall, but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper, that's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood. The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly, as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time, and somehow are not managing to. So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera. So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips. One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera. And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view. So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel. So here's a video. You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet. But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper. That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them.The next work is Decoy. This is a cardboard model, so the object is about as tall as I am. It has a rounded body, two arms, and a very tall, head-like antenna, and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself. So when a viewer passes by, it sort of tilts from side to side, and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer. So here is the first test scenario. You see the two movements integrated, and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation. But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention, it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get. (Laughter) So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy. It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines. Because we are always working from a very personal space, we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance, at least. And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention, but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help. The next work is an object, that's also a kind of sound instrument. In the shape of an amphitheater that's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage. So from where I'm standing, each of you appears to be this big, and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision. Seated in this audience are 996 small figures. They're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will. This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap, how hard, for how long, how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others, and if they want to contribute to innovation. So when the viewer steps in front of the audience, there will be a response. It could be a few claps or a strong applause, and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage, and again the audience will respond. It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience, or it could be a very loud ovation. So to us, I think we're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it, an instrument. So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied, nuanced musical or sound patterns, but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response. So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved. It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it. So here if you see we're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands. So here's a small visual animation, as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension. And here is a prototype. So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.Okay, this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners. It comes out of the idea of a window. This is an actual window in our studio, and as you can see, it's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections. So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides. This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures. They're also made up of three different sizes, as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain. Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks. So in contrast to this very tight grid, we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality, as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path. So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they're oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content, until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall. So to us, this work also presents its own contradiction. These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid, which is like a prison, but also a fortress, because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world. So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration, and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype. So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement. So it's really quite small. You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand. So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio, and here it is.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1921, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:15.911\nHi.

century,\n\n00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.273\nand the other is about 100 years ago,\n\n00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:11.229\nMalevich's abstract compositions.\n\n00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.245\nSo I'm just going to take you to a video.\n\n00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:14.618\nTo give you a sense of scale,\n\n00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:16.833\nthe largest panel is about two meters high.\n\n00:01:16.833 -->

attention.\n\n00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:25.947\nAnd after a while, if the viewer continues\n\n00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:27.675\nto remain in the space,\n\n00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:29.663\nthe panels will sort of become immune\n\n00:01:29.663 --> 00:01:31.376\nto the presence of the viewer\n\n00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:34.411\nand become lax and autonomous again,\n\n00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.786\nuntil they sort of sense a presence\nin the room or a movement,\n\n00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:40.485\nwhen they will again snap to attention.\n\n00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:41.964\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:44.363\nSo here it appears as if it's the viewer\n\n00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:47.608\nthat's sort of instigating the sense\nof order among the panels,\n\n00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.633\nbut it could also be the other way around,\n\n00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.977\nthat the panels are so stuck within\n\n00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.971\ntheir preconditioned behaviors\n\n00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:59.499\nthat they sort of thrust the\nviewer with the role of a tyrant.\n\n00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.997\nSo this brings me to a quieter, small work\n\n00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:03.566\ncalled Handheld.\n\n00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:05.300\nThe viewer sees a piece of paper\n\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.770\nthat's mounted on the far end of the wall,\n\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.398\nbut when you

00:02:15.928\nby two small hands\n\n00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:18.195\nthat appear to be carved with a great deal\n\n00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:21.668\nof attention and care from a small block of

two hands are trying\n\n00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:30.489\nto hold the paper very still\n\n00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.668\nfor a long period of time,\n\n00:02:32.668 --> 00:02:35.603\nand somehow are not managing to.\n\n00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:37.576\nSo this instability in the movement\n\n00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:41.094\nvery closely resembles the unsteady nature\n\n00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.656\nof images seen through a handheld camera.\n\n00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:46.344\nSo here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.\n\n00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:47.764\nOne is through a still camera\n\n00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:49.842\nand the other is through a handheld camera.\n\n00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:52.443\nAnd you immediately see how the unsteady nature\n\n00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:55.487\nof the video suggests the presence\n\n00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:57.989\nof an observer and a subjective point of view.\n\n00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.818\nSo we've just removed the camera\n\n00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:02.099\nand transferred that movement onto the panel.\n\n00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.616\nSo here's a video.\n\n00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:06.071\nYou have to imagine the other hand.\nIt's not there yet.\n\n00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:08.818\nBut to us, we're sort of trying to evoke\n\n00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:12.357\na self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person\n\n00:03:12.357 -->

00:03:27.352\nin front of them.\n\n00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.512\nThe next work is Decoy.\n\n00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:31.300\nThis is a cardboard model, so the object\n\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.204\nis about as tall as I am.\n\n00:03:33.204 --> 00:03:35.093\nIt has a rounded body, two arms,\n\n00:03:35.093 --> 00:03:37.304\nand a very tall, head-like antenna,\n\n00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:41.201\nand its sole purpose is to\nattract attention towards itself.\n\n00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.987\nSo when a viewer passes by,\n\n00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:45.802\nit sort of tilts from side to side,\n\n00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:47.975\nand moves its arms more and more frantically\n\n00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:51.342\nas the person gets closer.\n\n00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:53.866\nSo here is the first test scenario.\n\n00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.755\nYou see the two movements integrated,\n\n00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:57.744\nand the object seems to be employing\n\n00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:02.816\nits entire being in this expression of desperation.\n\n00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:05.480\nBut the idea is that once it's\ngot the person's attention,\n\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.552\nit's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.\n\n00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:12.666\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.698\nSo this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.\n\n00:04:15.698 --> 00:04:17.815\nIt appears to be mass-manufactured\n\n00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:19.517\nlike it came out of a factory\n\n00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:21.794\nlike vacuum cleaners and washing machines.\n\n00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:23.297\nBecause we are always working\n\n00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:24.705\nfrom a very personal space,\n\n00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:27.132\nwe like how this consumer aesthetic\n\n00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:29.204\nsort of depersonalizes the object\n\n00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:30.935\nand gives us a bit of distance\n\n00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:32.855\nin its appearance, at least.\n\n00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.195\nAnd so to us this is a kind of sinister being\n\n00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:37.314\nwhich is trying to distract you from the things\n\n00:04:37.314

the size of an audience\n\n00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:54.072\nas perceived from somebody from the stage.\n\n00:04:54.072 --> 00:04:55.686\nSo from where I'm standing,\n\n00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.348\neach of you appears to be this big,\n\n00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:59.401\nand the audience sort of takes the entire\n\n00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:01.414\nfield of my vision.\n\n00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:05.376\nSeated in this audience are 996 small figures.\n\n00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:07.562\nThey're mechanically enabled to clap\n\n00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:09.332\nof their own free will.\n\n00:05:09.332 --> 00:05:11.365\nThis means that each of them can decide\n\n00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:12.945\nif and when they want to clap,\n\n00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.577\nhow hard, for how long,\n\n00:05:14.577 --> 00:05:18.264\nhow they want to be influenced by\nthose around them or influence others,\n\n00:05:18.264 --> 00:05:22.244\nand if they want to contribute to innovation.\n\n00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:24.761\nSo when the viewer steps in front of the audience,\n\n00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:26.445\nthere will be a response.\n\n00:05:26.445 --> 00:05:29.043\nIt could be a few claps or a strong applause,\n\n00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:31.227\nand then nothing happens until the viewer\n\n00:05:31.227 --> 00:05:34.303\nleaves the stage, and again\nthe audience will respond.\n\n00:05:34.303 --> 00:05:36.628\nIt could be anything from a few feeble claps\n\n00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.310\nfrom members in the audience,\n\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.638\nor it could be a very loud ovation.\n\n00:05:42.638 --> 00:05:44.600\nSo to us, I think we're really looking\n\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.897\nat an audience as its own object\n\n00:05:46.897 --> 00:05:48.613\nor its own organism\n\n00:05:48.613 --> 00:05:52.363\nthat's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,\n\n00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:53.743\nan instrument.\n\n00:05:53.743 --> 00:05:55.499\nSo the viewer can play it\n\n00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:57.935\nby eliciting quite complex and varied,\n\n00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:00.631\nnuanced musical or sound patterns,\n\n00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:02.907\nbut cannot really provoke the audience\n\n00:06:02.907 --> 00:06:05.295\ninto any particular kind of response.\n\n00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:08.039\nSo there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness\n\n00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.280\nand uneasiness involved.\n\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.389\nIt also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.\n\n00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.509\nSo here if you see we're quite excited about\n\n00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.331\nthe image of the head splitting\nto form the two hands.\n\n00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:22.242\nSo here's a small visual animation,\n\n00:06:22.242 --> 00:06:26.574\nas if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing\n\n00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:28.601\nagainst each other to kind of make sense\n\n00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:31.136\nof the duality and the tension.\n\n00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:33.704\nAnd here is a prototype.\n\n00:06:33.704 --> 00:06:38.506\nSo we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.\n\n00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:41.509\nOkay, this is the last work.\nIt's called the Framerunners.\n\n00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.028\nIt comes out of the idea of a window.\n\n00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:46.339\nThis is an actual window in our studio,\n\n00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.257\nand as you can see, it's made up of three\n\n00:06:48.257 --> 00:06:50.539\ndifferent thicknesses of wooden sections.\n\n00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.812\nSo we used the same window vocabulary\n\n00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.639\nto construct our own frame or grid\n\n00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.581\nthat's suspended in the room and that can\n\n00:06:57.581 --> 00:06:59.394\nbe viewed from two sides.\n\n00:06:59.394 --> 00:07:02.368\nThis grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.\n\n00:07:02.368 --> 00:07:04.933\nThey're also made up of three different sizes,\n\n00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:07.359\nas if to suggest a kind of perspective\n\n00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.070\nor landscape on the single plain.\n\n00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.515\nEach of these figures can also run backward\n\n00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.080\nand forward in the track\n\n00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.637\nand hide behind two adjacent tracks.\n\n00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.747\nSo in contrast to this very tight grid,\n\n00:07:19.747 --> 00:07:22.168\nwe wanted to give these figures a very comical\n\n00:07:22.168 --> 00:07:24.257\nand slapstick-like quality,\n\n00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:26.096\nas if a puppeteer has taken them\n\n00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:28.837\nand physically animated them down the path.\n\n00:07:28.837 --> 00:07:31.117\nSo we like the idea of these figures\n\n00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.653\nsort of skipping along\n\n00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:34.741\nlike they're oblivious and carefree\n\n00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:37.289\nand happy-go-lucky and content,\n\n00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.489\nuntil they sort of sense a movement from the viewer\n\n00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:44.757\nand they will hide behind the fastest wall.\n\n00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:48.591\nSo to us, this work also presents\nits own contradiction.\n\n00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:50.415\nThese figures are sort of entrapped\n\n00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:52.562\nwithin this very strong grid,\n\n00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:55.318\nwhich is like a prison, but also a fortress,\n\n00:07:55.318 --> 00:07:57.252\nbecause it allows them to be oblivious\n\n00:07:57.252 --> 00:07:59.957\nand naive and carefree and quite oblivious\n\n00:07:59.957 --> 00:08:02.526\nof the external world.\n\n00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:05.331\nSo all these real life qualities that I talk about\n\n00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:07.613\nare sort of translated to a very specific\n\n00:08:07.613 --> 00:08:09.374\ntechnical configuration,\n\n00:08:09.374 --> 00:08:11.417\nand we were very lucky to collaborate\n\n00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:14.585\nwith ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.\n\n00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:16.850\nSo you see they extracted the motion cogs\n\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.940\nfrom our animations and created a wiggle\n\n00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.894\nthat integrated the head-bobbing movement\n\n00:08:20.894 --> 00:08:22.662\nand the back-and-forth movement.\n\n00:08:22.662 --> 00:08:24.184\nSo it's really quite small.\n\n00:08:24.184 --> 00:08:26.476\nYou can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.\n\n00:08:26.476 --> 00:08:28.287\nSo imagine our excitement when we saw it\n\n00:08:28.287 --> 00:08:31.452\nreally working in the studio, and here it is.\n\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.217\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:38.765\nThank you.\n\n00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:48.748\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Does the media have a \"duty of care\"?", "duration": "641", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_puttnam_what_happens_when_the_media_s_priority_is_profit", "transcript": "I'd like to start, if I may, with the story of the Paisley snail. On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928, May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city, and there at the Wellmeadow Caf\u00e9, she had a Scots ice cream float, a mix of ice cream and ginger beer bought for her by a friend. The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle labeled \"D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley.\" She drank some of the ice cream float, but as the remaining ginger beer was poured into her tumbler, a decomposed snail floated to the surface of her glass. Three days later, she was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock.The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed set a very important legal precedent: Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer, was held to have a clear duty of care towards May Donoghue, even though there was no contract between them, and, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink. One of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this: You must take care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor. Indeed, one wonders that without a duty of care, how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business.Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story, because it's an important principle. Last year, the Hansard Society, a nonpartisan charity which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics published, alongside their annual audit of political engagement, an additional section devoted entirely to politics and the media. Here are a couple of rather depressing observations from that survey. Tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers, relative even to those who read no newspapers whatsoever. Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers. They're not just less politically engaged. They are consuming media that reinforces their negative evaluation of politics, thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical attitude to democracy and their own role within it. Little wonder that the report concluded that in this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids, appear not to be living up to the importance of their role in our democracy.Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously challenge that view. But if Hansard are right, and they usually are, then we've got a very serious problem on our hands, and it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes focusing upon.Since the Paisley snail, and especially over the past decade or so, a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion of a duty of care as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society. Generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another, either physically, mentally or economically. This is principally focused on obvious areas, such as our empathetic response to children and young people, to our service personnel, and to the elderly and infirm. It is seldom, if ever, extended to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government, to the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality are fundamental to the process of building and embedding an informed, participatory democracy. And the more you think about it, the stranger that is.A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of England. It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360. As I walked through their impressive, glass-covered atrium, in front of me, emblazoned on the wall in letters of fire was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction: If it's not true, don't say it; if it's not right, don't do it. The head teacher saw me staring at it, and he said, \"Oh, that's our school motto.\" On the train back to London, I couldn't get it out of my mind. I kept thinking, can it really have taken us over 2,000 years to come to terms with that simple notion as being our minimum expectation of each other? Isn't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values? After all, the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence, and that being the case, can we be really comfortable with the thought that we're in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them? Could anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence, that the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen would be likely to undermine or even damage our inherently fragile democratic settlement.Now there will be those who will argue that this could all too easily drift into a form of censorship, albeit self-censorship, but I don't buy that argument. It has to be possible to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social responsibilities.Let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker. Throughout that career, I never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what he or she believed to be a decent set of values for their own life, their own family, and the future of the society in which we all live. I'd go further. A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit. As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well-honed professional skills. Obviously this is not a mandated duty, but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger, it strikes me as being utterly inescapable.We should always remember that our notion of individual freedom and its partner, creative freedom, is comparatively new in the history of Western ideas, and for that reason, it's often undervalued and can be very quickly undermined. It's a prize easily lost, and once lost, once surrendered, it can prove very, very hard to reclaim. And its first line of defense has to be our own standards, not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation, our own standards and our own integrity. Our integrity as we deal with those with whom we work and our own standards as we operate within society. And these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda. They're part of a collective responsibility, the responsibility of the artist or the journalist to deal with the world as it really is, and this, in turn, must go hand in hand with the responsibility of those governing society to also face up to that world, and not to be tempted to misappropriate the causes of its ills. Yet, as has become strikingly clear over the last couple of years, such responsibility has to a very great extent been abrogated by large sections of the media. And as a consequence, across the Western world, the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned, older demographic, along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young, taken together, these and other similarly contemporary aberrations are threatening to squeeze the life out of active, informed debate and engagement, and I stress active.The most ardent of libertarians might argue that Donoghue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it. But most of us, I think, accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care, and the key word here is reasonable. Judges must ask, did they take reasonable care and could they have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions? Far from signifying overbearing state power, it's that small common sense test of reasonableness that I'd like us to apply to those in the media who, after all, set the tone and the content for much of our democratic discourse.Democracy, in order to work, requires that reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate difficult, sometimes complex issues, and they do so in an atmosphere which strives for the type of understanding that leads to, if not agreement, then at least a productive and workable compromise. Politics is about choices, and within those choices, politics is about priorities. It's about reconciling conflicting preferences wherever and whenever possibly based on fact. But if the facts themselves are distorted, the resolutions are likely only to create further conflict, with all the stresses and strains on society that inevitably follow. The media have to decide: Do they see their role as being to inflame or to inform? Because in the end, it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership.Fifty years ago this week, President John F. Kennedy made two epoch-making speeches, the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights. The first led almost immediately to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, both of which represented giant leaps forward. Democracy, well-led and well-informed, can achieve very great things, but there's a precondition. We have to trust that those making those decisions are acting in the best interest not of themselves but of the whole of the people. We need factually-based options, clearly laid out, not those of a few powerful and potentially manipulative corporations pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas, but accurate, unprejudiced information with which to make our own judgments. If we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives for our children and our children's children, we need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible that duty of care for a vibrant, and hopefully a lasting, democracy. Thank you very much for listening to me.

Hansard are right, and they usually are,\n\n00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:48.647\nthen we've got a very serious problem on our hands,\n\n00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:51.282\nand it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes\n\n00:02:51.282 --> 00:02:53.311\nfocusing upon.\n\n00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:54.994\nSince the Paisley snail,\n\n00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:57.458\nand especially over the past decade or so,\n\n00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.377\na great deal of thinking has been developed\n\n00:02:59.377 --> 00:03:01.236\naround the notion of a duty of care\n\n00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:03.775\nas it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.\n\n00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:06.519\nGenerally a duty of care arises when one individual\n\n00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.253\nor a group of individuals undertakes an activity\n\n00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:11.783\nwhich has the potential to cause harm to another,\n\n00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:14.497\neither physically, mentally or economically.\n\n00:03:14.497 --> 00:03:16.968\nThis is principally focused on obvious areas,\n\n00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:20.010\nsuch as our empathetic response\nto children and young people,\n\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.736\nto our service personnel, and\nto the elderly and infirm.\n\n00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:26.929\nIt is seldom, if ever, extended\nto equally important arguments\n\n00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:31.179\naround the fragility of our\npresent system of government,\n\n00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.688\nto the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality\n\n00:03:34.688 --> 00:03:36.832\nare fundamental to the process of building\n\n00:03:36.832 --> 00:03:38.561\nand embedding an informed,\n\n00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.318\nparticipatory democracy.\n\n00:03:41.318 --> 00:03:42.739\nAnd the more you think about it,\n\n00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.570\nthe stranger that is.\n\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.032\nA couple of years ago, I had the pleasure\n\n00:03:46.032 --> 00:03:47.786\nof opening a brand new school\n\n00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:49.357\nin the northeast of England.\n\n00:03:49.357 --> 00:03:52.896\nIt had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.\n\n00:03:52.896 --> 00:03:54.748\nAs I walked through their impressive,\n\n00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:56.123\nglass-covered atrium,\n\n00:03:56.123 --> 00:03:57.941\nin front of me, emblazoned on the wall\n\n00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.489\nin letters of fire\n\n00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.590\nwas Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:\n\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.445\nIf it's not true, don't say it;\n\n00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.528\nif it's not right, don't do it.\n\n00:04:08.528 --> 00:04:10.516\nThe head teacher saw me staring at it,\n\n00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.308\nand he said, \"Oh, that's our school motto.\"\n\n00:04:13.308 --> 00:04:15.035\nOn the train back to London,\n\n00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:16.889\nI couldn't get it out of my mind.\n\n00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.448\nI kept thinking, can it really have taken us\n\n00:04:19.448 --> 00:04:21.659\nover 2,000 years to come to terms\n\n00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.524\nwith that simple notion\n\n00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:26.476\nas being our minimum expectation of each other?\n\n00:04:26.476 --> 00:04:29.084\nIsn't it time that we develop this concept\n\n00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:30.753\nof a duty of care\n\n00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:33.179\nand extended it to include a care\n\n00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:36.443\nfor our shared but increasingly\nendangered democratic values?\n\n00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.300\nAfter all, the absence of a duty of care\n\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.890\nwithin many professions\n\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.393\ncan all too easily amount to\naccusations of negligence,\n\n00:04:42.393 --> 00:04:45.500\nand that being the case, can we be\nreally comfortable with the thought\n\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.801\nthat we're in effect being negligent\n\n00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:50.592\nin respect of the health of our own societies\n\n00:04:50.592 --> 00:04:53.327\nand the values that necessarily underpin them?\n\n00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:56.322\nCould anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,\n\n00:04:56.322 --> 00:04:59.578\nthat the same media which\nHansard so roundly condemned\n\n00:04:59.578 --> 00:05:02.865\nhave taken sufficient care to avoid behaving\n\n00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:06.307\nin ways which they could reasonably have foreseen\n\n00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:08.408\nwould be likely to undermine or even damage\n\n00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:11.242\nour inherently fragile democratic settlement.\n\n00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:13.263\nNow there will be those who will argue\n\n00:05:13.263 --> 00:05:15.036\nthat this could all too easily drift into a form\n\n00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:17.043\nof censorship, albeit self-censorship,\n\n00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:18.999\nbut I don't buy that argument.\n\n00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.058\nIt has to be possible\n\n00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:23.158\nto balance freedom of expression\n\n00:05:23.158 --> 00:05:26.365\nwith wider moral and social responsibilities.\n\n00:05:26.365 --> 00:05:28.216\nLet me explain why by taking the example\n\n00:05:28.216 --> 00:05:31.119\nfrom my own career as a filmmaker.\n\n00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:32.926\nThroughout that career, I never accepted\n\n00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.553\nthat a filmmaker should set about putting\n\n00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:37.603\ntheir own work outside or above what he or she\n\n00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.553\nbelieved to be a decent set of values\n\n00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:42.902\nfor their own life, their own family,\n\n00:05:42.902 --> 00:05:46.493\nand the future of the society in which we all live.\n\n00:05:46.493 --> 00:05:47.817\nI'd go further.\n\n00:05:47.817 --> 00:05:51.111\nA responsible filmmaker should\nnever devalue their work\n\n00:05:51.111 --> 00:05:53.155\nto a point at which it becomes less than true\n\n00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:56.595\nto the world they themselves wish to inhabit.\n\n00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:59.981\nAs I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers\n\n00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:02.505\nare all required to face up to the social expectations\n\n00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:06.260\nthat come with combining the\nintrinsic power of their medium\n\n00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.634\nwith their well-honed professional skills.\n\n00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:12.521\nObviously this is not a mandated duty,\n\n00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:15.003\nbut for the gifted filmmaker\nand the responsible journalist\n\n00:06:15.003 --> 00:06:18.812\nor even blogger, it strikes me\nas being utterly inescapable.\n\n00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:21.422\nWe should always remember that our notion\n\n00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.313\nof individual freedom and\nits partner, creative freedom,\n\n00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:26.108\nis comparatively new\n\n00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:28.370\nin the history of Western ideas,\n\n00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.288\nand for that reason, it's often undervalued\n\n00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:32.651\nand can be very quickly undermined.\n\n00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:34.878\nIt's a prize easily lost,\n\n00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:36.641\nand once lost, once surrendered,\n\n00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:39.958\nit can prove very, very hard to reclaim.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.483\nAnd its first line of defense\n\n00:06:41.483 --> 00:06:43.834\nhas to be our own standards,\n\n00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:47.573\nnot those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,\n\n00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.396\nour own standards and our own integrity.\n\n00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:51.390\nOur integrity as we deal with those\n\n00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.938\nwith whom we work\n\n00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:56.563\nand our own standards as we operate within society.\n\n00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:58.033\nAnd these standards of ours\n\n00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:01.298\nneed to be all of a piece with\na sustainable social agenda.\n\n00:07:01.298 --> 00:07:03.411\nThey're part of a collective responsibility,\n\n00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.541\nthe responsibility of the artist or the journalist\n\n00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:07.915\nto deal with the world as it really is,\n\n00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:10.364\nand this, in turn, must go hand in hand\n\n00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:12.782\nwith the responsibility of those governing society\n\n00:07:12.782 --> 00:07:14.859\nto also face up to that world,\n\n00:07:14.859 --> 00:07:17.219\nand not to be tempted to misappropriate\n\n00:07:17.234 --> 00:07:19.811\nthe causes of its ills.\n\n00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:22.457\nYet, as has become strikingly clear\n\n00:07:22.457 --> 00:07:24.525\nover the last couple of years,\n\n00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:26.559\nsuch responsibility has to a very great extent\n\n00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.602\nbeen abrogated by large sections of the media.\n\n00:07:29.602 --> 00:07:31.542\nAnd as a consequence, across the Western world,\n\n00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:34.841\nthe over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest\n\n00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:37.226\nand their appeal to a largely disillusioned,\n\n00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:38.615\nolder demographic,\n\n00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:40.823\nalong with the apathy and obsession with the trivial\n\n00:07:40.823 -->

I stress active.\n\n00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:57.285\nThe most ardent of libertarians might argue\n\n00:07:57.285 --> 00:08:00.279\nthat Donoghue v. Stevenson should\nhave been thrown out of court\n\n00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.397\nand that Stevenson would eventually\nhave gone out of business\n\n00:08:02.397 --> 00:08:05.814\nif he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.\n\n00:08:05.814 --> 00:08:09.228\nBut most of us, I think, accept some small role\n\n00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:12.306\nfor the state to enforce a duty of care,\n\n00:08:12.306 --> 00:08:14.978\nand the key word here is reasonable.\n\n00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:18.558\nJudges must ask, did they take reasonable care\n\n00:08:18.558 --> 00:08:19.973\nand could they have reasonably foreseen\n\n00:08:19.973 --> 00:08:22.171\nthe consequences of their actions?\n\n00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:25.153\nFar from signifying overbearing state power,\n\n00:08:25.153 --> 00:08:28.678\nit's that small common sense test of reasonableness\n\n00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:31.337\nthat I'd like us to apply to those in the media\n\n00:08:31.337 --> 00:08:33.608\nwho, after all, set the tone and the content\n\n00:08:33.608 --> 00:08:36.925\nfor much of our democratic discourse.\n\n00:08:36.925 --> 00:08:39.645\nDemocracy, in order to work, requires that\n\n00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:42.593\nreasonable men and women take\nthe time to understand and debate\n\n00:08:42.593 --> 00:08:44.925\ndifficult, sometimes complex issues,\n\n00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:47.218\nand they do so in an atmosphere which strives\n\n00:08:47.218 --> 00:08:49.617\nfor the type of understanding that leads to,\n\n00:08:49.617 --> 00:08:51.684\nif not agreement, then at least a productive\n\n00:08:51.684 --> 00:08:54.051\nand workable compromise.\n\n00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:56.408\nPolitics is about choices,\n\n00:08:56.408 --> 00:09:00.399\nand within those choices, politics is about priorities.\n\n00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.937\nIt's about reconciling conflicting preferences\n\n00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:08.153\nwherever and whenever possibly based on fact.\n\n00:09:08.153 --> 00:09:10.624\nBut if the facts themselves are distorted,\n\n00:09:10.624 --> 00:09:14.347\nthe resolutions are likely only\nto create further conflict,\n\n00:09:14.347 --> 00:09:16.234\nwith all the stresses and strains on society\n\n00:09:16.234 --> 00:09:18.450\nthat inevitably follow.\n\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.397\nThe media have to decide:\n\n00:09:20.397 --> 00:09:23.571\nDo they see their role as being to inflame\n\n00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:25.901\nor to inform?\n\n00:09:25.901 --> 00:09:28.763\nBecause in the end, it comes down to a combination\n\n00:09:28.763 --> 00:09:31.254\nof trust and leadership.\n\n00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:33.831\nFifty years ago this week,\nPresident John F.

How to rethink environmental folklore", "duration": "1087", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/leyla_acaroglu_paper_beats_plastic_how_to_rethink_environmental_folklore", "transcript": "So imagine, you're in the supermarket, you're buying some groceries, and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag. Which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment?Most people do pick the paper. Okay, let's think of why. It's brown to start with. Therefore, it must be good for the environment. It's biodegradable. It's reusable. In some cases, it's recyclable. So when people are looking at the plastic bag, it's likely they're thinking of something like this, which we all know is absolutely terrible, and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages. But people are often not thinking of something like this, which is the other end of the spectrum. When we produce materials, we need to extract them from the environment, and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts.You see, what happens is, when we need to make complex choices, us humans like really simple solutions, and so we often ask for simple solutions. And I work in design. I advise designers and innovators around sustainability, and everyone always says to me, \"Oh Leyla, I just want the eco-materials.\"And I say, \"Well, that's very complex, and we'll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco-material means, because everything at some point comes from nature, and it's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact. So what happens is, we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions. So I like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore. It's either the little voice at the back of your head, or it's that gut feeling you get when you've done the right thing, so when you've picked the paper bag or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car. And environmental folklore is a really important thing because we're trying to do the right thing. But how do we know if we're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment?So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences, the things we've heard from other people. It doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework. And this is really hard, because we live in incredibly complex systems. We have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society, We have the industrial systems, which is essentially the entire economy, and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system, and, I would argue, the most important, the ecosystem. And you see, the choices that we make as an individual, but the choices that we make in every single job that we have, no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order, has an impact on all of these systems. And the thing is that we have to find ways if we're actually going to address sustainability of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains. What we need to do is we need to learn to do more with less. We have an increasing population, and everybody likes their mobile phones, especially in this situation here. So we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face.And that's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in. So essentially, everything that is created goes through a series of life cycle stages, and we use this scientific process called life cycle assessment, or in America, you guys say life cycle analysis, in order to have a clearer picture of how everything that we do in the technical part of those systems affects the natural environment. So we go all the way back to the extraction of raw materials, and then we look at manufacturing, we look at packaging and transportation, use, and end of life, and at every single one of these stages, the things that we do have an interaction with the natural environment, and we can monitor how that interaction is actually affecting the systems and services that make life on Earth possible. And through doing this, we've learned some absolutely fascinating things. And we've busted a bunch of myths.So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot. It's used a lot in marketing, and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation when we're talking about sustainability, and that's the word biodegradability. Now biodegradability is a material property; it is not a definition of environmental benefits. Allow me to explain. When something natural, something that's made from a cellulose fiber like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste, or even a piece of paper, when something natural ends up in the natural environment, it degrades normally. Its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, but this is a net situation. Most natural things don't actually end up in nature. Most of the things, the waste that  we produce, end up in landfill. Landfill is a different environment. In landfill, those same carbon molecules degrade in a different way, because a landfill is anaerobic. It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot. Those same molecules, they become methane, and methane is a 25 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So our old lettuces and products that we have thrown out that are made out of biodegradable materials, if they end up in landfill, contribute to climate change. You see, there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power, displacing the need for fossil fuel power, but we need to be smart about this. We need to identify how we can start to leverage these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems. Because right now, what people do is they turn around and they say, \"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper because that is better for the environment.\" But if you're throwing it in the bin, and your local landfill facility is just a normal one, then we're having what's called a double negative.I'm a product designer by trade. I then did social science. And so I'm absolutely fascinated by consumer goods and how the consumer goods that we have kind of become immune to that fill our lives have an impact on the natural environment. And these guys are, like, serial offenders, and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator. Now America has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators. In the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot on average, the standard size of a refrigerator. And the problem is, they're so big now, it's easier for us to buy more food that we can't eat or find. I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years, all right? And so what happens is, we waste more food. And as I was just explaining, food waste is a problem. In fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent of food purchased for the home is wasted. Half of the world's produced food is wasted. That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food. It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum. And I blame it on the refrigerator, well, especially in Western cultures, because it makes it easier. I mean, there's a lot of complex systems going on here. I don't want to make it so simplistic.But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this, and one of the features of it is the crisper drawer. You all got crisper drawers? The drawer that you put your lettuces in? Lettuces have a habit of going soggy in the crisper drawers, don't they? Yeah? Soggy lettuces? In the U.K., this is such a problem that there was a government report a few years ago that actually said the second biggest offender of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce. It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report. Okay? So this is a problem, people. These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left, right and center because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp. Okay. You need a tight environment. You need, like, an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally. But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer with a slightly better seal. Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed. Don't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that. But essentially, this is a big problem. Because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system, not only do we have that impact  I just explained at the end of life, but we actually have had to grow that lettuce. The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical. We've had to clear land. We've had to plant seeds, phosphorus, fertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight. All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system, which makes it a far bigger environmental impact than the loss of the energy from the fridge. So we need to design things like this far better if we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems. We could start with the crisper drawer and the size. For those of you in the room who do design fridges, that would be great.The problem is, imagine if we actually started to reconsider  how we designed things. So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity, but we actually haven't really changed the design of them that much since the 1950s. A little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes, cold boxes that we store stuff in. So imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those problems. This is design-led system change, design dictating the way in which the system can be far more sustainable. Forty percent food waste is a major problem. Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that.Another item that I find fascinating is the electric tea kettle, which I found out that you don't do tea kettles in this country, really, do you? But that's really big in the U.K. Ninety-seven percent of households in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle. So they're very popular. And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm or a designer, and they were designing one of these, and they wanted to do it eco, they'd usually ask me two things. They'd say, \"Leyla, how do I make it technically efficient?\" Because obviously energy's a problem with this product. Or, \"How do I make it green materials? How do I make the materials green in the manufacturing?\" Would you ask me those questions? They seem logical, right? Yeah. Well I'd say, \"You're looking at the wrong problems.\" Because the problem is with use. It's with how people use the product. Sixty-five percent of Brits admit to over-filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea. All of this extra water that's being boiled requires energy, and it's been calculated that in one day of extra energy use from boiling kettles is enough to light all of the streetlights in England for a night.But this is the thing. This is what I call a product-person failure. But we've got a product-system failure going on with these little guys, and they're so ubiquitous, you  don't even notice they're there. And this guy over here, though, he does. He's named Simon. Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K. He has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody's homes. He's also watching television. The reason is because there's a unique phenomenon that happens in the U.K. the moment that very popular TV shows end. The minute the ad break comes on, this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from France, because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time. (Laughter) 1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic. So imagine if you designed kettles, you actually found a way to solve these system failures, because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system, just because the product hasn't thought about the problem that it's going to have when it exists in the world. Now, I looked at a number of kettles available on the market, and found the minimum fill lines, so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there, was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water just to make one cup of tea. So this kettle here is an example of one where it actually has two reservoirs. One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder. The user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled, which means, because we're all lazy, you only fill exactly what you need. And this is what I call behavior-changing products: products, systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front.Now, this is a technology arena, so obviously these things are quite popular, but I think if we're going to keep designing, buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do, which is astronomically high, there are seven billion people who live in the world right now. There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year. Every single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones roll off production lines, and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate. One hundred fifty-two million phones  were thrown out in the U.S. last year; only 11 percent were recycled. I'm from Australia. We have a population of 22 million \u2014 don't laugh \u2014 and it's been reported that 22 million phones are in people's drawers. We need to find ways of solving the problems around this, because these things are so complicated. They have so much locked up inside them. Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore? There's a number of highly complex and valuable materials embodied inside these things, so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly, because this is otherwise what happens. This is a community in Ghana, and e-waste is reported, or electronic waste is reported by the U.N. as being up to 50 million tons trafficked. This is how they get the gold and the other valuable materials out. They burn the electronic waste in open spaces. These are communities, and this is happening all over the world. And because we don't see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers, as businesspeople, as consumers, then these kinds of externalities happen, and these are people's lives. So we need to find smarter, more systems-based, innovative solutions to these problems, if we're going to start to live sustainably within this world.So imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone, your new one because you replaced your old one \u2014 after 15 to 18 months is the average time that people replace their phones, by the way \u2014 so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing, then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems. The people who produce these phones, and some of which I'm sure are in the room right now, could potentially look at doing what we call closed-loop systems, or product system services, so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand's not going to go anywhere, so you design the product to solve the problem. Design for disassembly, design for light-weighting. We heard some of those kinds of strategies being used in the Tesla Motors car today. These kinds of approaches are not hard, but understanding the system and then looking for viable, market-driven consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering the sustainability agenda, because I hate to break it to you all: Consumption is the biggest problem. But design is one of the best solutions.These kinds of products are everywhere. By identifying alternative ways of doing things, we can actually start to innovate, and I say actually start to innovate. I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative. But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter, as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions, because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products, they're participating in these major problems. So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do.If you just had paper or plastic \u2014 obviously reusable is far more beneficial \u2014 then the paper is worse, and the paper is worse because it weighs four to 10 times more than the plastic, and when we actually compare, from a life cycle perspective, a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper, the paper is far better, but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not  done with a kilo of each material. It's done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper. Because functionality defines environmental impact, and I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco-materials. I say, there's only a few materials that you should completely avoid. The rest of them, it's all about application, and at the end of the day, everything we design and produce in the economy or buy as consumers is done so for function. We want something, therefore we buy it. So breaking things back down and delivering smartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing, everything, all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life, we can start to actually find really innovative solutions.And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently  who I work with, a senior designer. I said, \"How come you're not doing  sustainability? I know you know this.\" And he said, \"Well, recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client, and turned and he said to me, 'I know it's going to cost less, I know it's going to sell more, but we're not pioneers, because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'\"I think we've got a roomful of pioneers, and I hope there are far more pioneers out there, because we need to solve these problems.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1926, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:15.313\nSo imagine, you're in the supermarket,\n\n00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:16.894\nyou're buying some groceries,\n\n00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:18.519\nand you get given the option\n\n00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.154\nfor a plastic or a paper shopping bag.\n\n00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.344\nWhich one do you choose if you want to do\n\n00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:26.760\nthe right thing by the environment?\n\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.641\nMost people do pick the paper.\n\n00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:29.869\nOkay, let's think of why.\n\n00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.562\nIt's brown to start with.\n\n00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.038\nTherefore, it must be good for the environment.\n\n00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:35.556\nIt's biodegradable.

likely they're thinking of something like this,\n\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.613\nwhich we all know is absolutely terrible,\n\n00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:47.829\nand we should be avoiding at all

this,\n\n00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:56.993\nwhich is the other end of the spectrum.\n\n00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:59.760\nWhen we produce materials,\n\n00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.390\nwe need to extract them

--> 00:01:09.447\nto make complex choices,\n\n00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:11.868\nus humans like really simple solutions,\n\n00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:14.484\nand so we often ask for simple solutions.\n\n00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:15.957\nAnd I work in design.\n\n00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:17.468\nI advise designers\n\n00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:19.733\nand innovators around

say, \"Well, that's very complex,\n\n00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:27.322\nand we'll have to spend four hours talking about\n\n00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:29.237\nwhat exactly an eco-material

of intuitive framework\n\n00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:43.660\nwhen we make decisions.\n\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.990\nSo I like to call that intuitive framework\n\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.585\nour environmental folklore.\n\n00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:51.342\nIt's either the little voice\nat the back of your head,\n\n00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:53.614\nor it's that gut feeling you get\n\n00:01:53.614 -->

car.\n\n00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:02.816\nAnd environmental folklore is a really important thing\n\n00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:05.264\nbecause we're trying to do the right thing.\n\n00:02:05.264 -->

environmental folklore is\n\n00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:22.043\nit tends to be based on our experiences,\n\n00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:23.774\nthe things we've heard from other people.\n\n00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:26.414\nIt doesn't tend to be based\non any scientific framework.\n\n00:02:26.414 --> 00:02:28.081\nAnd this is really hard, because we live\n\n00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.101\nin incredibly complex systems.\n\n00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:31.821\nWe have the human systems\n\n00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:33.587\nof how we communicate and interrelate\n\n00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:36.102\nand have our whole constructed society,\n\n00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:39.995\nWe have the industrial systems,\nwhich is essentially the entire economy,\n\n00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:41.848\nand then all of that has to operate\n\n00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:43.373\nwithin the biggest system,\n\n00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:45.465\nand, I would argue, the most important,\n\n00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.121\nthe ecosystem.\n\n00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:48.983\nAnd you see, the choices that we make\n\n00:02:48.983 --> 00:02:50.416\nas an individual,\n\n00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:51.727\nbut the choices that we

00:02:59.557\nhas an impact on all of these systems.\n\n00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:01.892\nAnd the thing is that we have to find ways\n\n00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:03.831\nif we're actually going to address

environmental gains.\n\n00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:14.155\nWhat we need to do is we need to learn\n\n00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.231\nto do more with less.\n\n00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:18.122\nWe have an increasing population,\n\n00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:19.956\nand everybody likes their mobile phones,\n\n00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:22.071\nespecially in this situation here.\n\n00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:26.126\nSo we need to find innovative ways of solving\nsome of these problems that we face.\n\n00:03:26.126 --> 00:03:29.321\nAnd that's where this process called\nlife cycle thinking comes in.\n\n00:03:29.324 --> 00:03:32.011\nSo essentially, everything that is created\n\n00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.522\ngoes through a series of life cycle stages,\n\n00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:36.384\nand we use this scientific process\n\n00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:38.108\ncalled life cycle assessment,\n\n00:03:38.108 --> 00:03:40.849\nor in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,\n\n00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.396\nin order to have a clearer picture of how\n\n00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:48.202\neverything that we do in the\ntechnical part of those systems\n\n00:03:48.202 --> 00:03:49.983\naffects the natural environment.\n\n00:03:49.983 --> 00:03:51.953\nSo we go all the way back\n\n00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:54.156\nto the extraction of raw materials,\n\n00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:55.973\nand then we look at manufacturing,\n\n00:03:55.973 --> 00:03:57.832\nwe look at packaging and transportation,\n\n00:03:57.832 --> 00:03:59.482\nuse, and end of life,\n\n00:03:59.482 --> 00:04:02.399\nand at every single one of these stages,\n\n00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:03.918\nthe things that we do\n\n00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:05.749\nhave an interaction with the natural environment,\n\n00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.237\nand we can monitor how that interaction\n\n00:04:08.237 --> 00:04:11.967\nis actually affecting the systems and services\n\n00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:13.882\nthat make life on Earth possible.\n\n00:04:13.882 --> 00:04:15.518\nAnd through doing this,\n\n00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:19.808\nwe've learned some absolutely fascinating things.\n\n00:04:19.808 --> 00:04:21.521\nAnd we've busted a bunch of myths.\n\n00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:26.509\nSo to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.\n\n00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.242\nIt's used a lot in marketing,\n\n00:04:28.242 --> 00:04:30.242\nand it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation\n\n00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:32.175\nwhen we're talking about sustainability,\n\n00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:34.621\nand that's the word biodegradability.\n\n00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:39.569\nNow biodegradability is a material property;\n\n00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.817\nit is not a definition of environmental benefits.\n\n00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:44.720\nAllow me to explain.\n\n00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.412\nWhen something natural,\n\n00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:48.373\nsomething that's made from a cellulose fiber\n\n00:04:48.373 --> 00:04:51.901\nlike a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,\n\n00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:54.189\nor even a piece of paper,\n\n00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.003\nwhen something natural ends up\n\n00:04:56.003 --> 00:04:58.626\nin the natural environment, it degrades normally.\n\n00:04:58.626 --> 00:05:00.490\nIts little carbon molecules that it stored up\n\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.627\nas it was growing are naturally released\n\n00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:05.207\nback into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,\n\n00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:07.181\nbut this is a net situation.\n\n00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.546\nMost natural things\n\n00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:10.153\ndon't actually end up in nature.\n\n00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:13.564\nMost of the things, the waste that \nwe produce, end up in landfill.\n\n00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:15.966\nLandfill is a different environment.\n\n00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.409\nIn landfill, those same carbon molecules\n\n00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:19.927\ndegrade in a different way,\n\n00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:21.839\nbecause a landfill is anaerobic.\n\n00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.257\nIt's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.\n\n00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:27.605\nThose same molecules, they become methane,\n\n00:05:27.605 --> 00:05:30.523\nand methane is a 25 times more potent\n\n00:05:30.523 --> 00:05:33.376\ngreenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\n\n00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:36.129\nSo our old lettuces and products\n\n00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.708\nthat we have thrown out that are made\n\n00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:39.278\nout of biodegradable materials,\n\n00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:41.013\nif they end up in landfill,\n\n00:05:41.013 --> 00:05:43.039\ncontribute to climate change.\n\n00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.431\nYou see, there are facilities now\n\n00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:46.135\nthat can actually capture that methane\n\n00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:47.573\nand generate power,\n\n00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:50.364\ndisplacing the need for fossil fuel power,\n\n00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:51.829\nbut we need to be smart about this.\n\n00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:54.994\nWe need to identify how we can start to leverage\n\n00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:57.298\nthese types of things that are already happening\n\n00:05:57.298 --> 00:05:59.166\nand start to design systems and services\n\n00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:01.049\nthat alleviate these problems.\n\n00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:04.294\nBecause right now, what people do\nis they turn around and they say,\n\n00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:06.853\n\"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper\n\n00:06:06.853 --> 00:06:08.780\nbecause that is better for the environment.\"\n\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.198\nBut if you're throwing it in the bin,\n\n00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:11.661\nand your local landfill facility\n\n00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.082\nis just a normal one,\n\n00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:18.988\nthen we're having what's called a double negative.\n\n00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:22.152\nI'm a product designer by trade.\n\n00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:23.344\nI then did social science.\n\n00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:24.761\nAnd so I'm absolutely fascinated\n\n00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.760\nby consumer goods and how the consumer goods\n\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.882\nthat we have kind of become immune to\n\n00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:30.120\nthat fill our lives\n\n00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.928\nhave an impact on the natural environment.\n\n00:06:31.928 --> 00:06:34.541\nAnd these guys are, like, serial offenders,\n\n00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:36.404\nand I'm pretty sure everyone in this room\n\n00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:38.034\nhas a refrigerator.\n\n00:06:38.034 --> 00:06:39.666\nNow America has this amazing ability\n\n00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.675\nto keep growing refrigerators.\n\n00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:43.653\nIn the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot\n\n00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.501\non average, the standard size\n\n00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:47.130\nof a refrigerator.\n\n00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.589\nAnd the problem is, they're so big now,\n\n00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:51.783\nit's easier for us to buy more food\n\n00:06:51.783 --> 00:06:53.774\nthat we can't eat or find.\n\n00:06:53.774 --> 00:06:55.400\nI mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator\n\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.610\nthat have been there for years, all right?\n\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.246\nAnd so what happens is, we waste more food.\n\n00:07:00.246 --> 00:07:03.591\nAnd as I was just explaining,\nfood waste is a problem.\n\n00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:06.953\nIn fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent\n\n00:07:06.953 --> 00:07:09.528\nof food purchased for the home is wasted.\n\n00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:13.863\nHalf of the world's produced food is wasted.\n\n00:07:13.863 --> 00:07:16.516\nThat's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.\n\n00:07:16.516 --> 00:07:21.053\nIt's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.\n\n00:07:21.053 --> 00:07:23.057\nAnd I blame it on the refrigerator,\n\n00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:24.585\nwell, especially in Western cultures,\n\n00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:26.435\nbecause it makes it easier.\n\n00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:28.827\nI mean, there's a lot of complex\nsystems going on here.\n\n00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:30.765\nI don't want to make it so simplistic.\n\n00:07:30.765 --> 00:07:33.715\nBut the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,\n\n00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:35.573\nand one of the features of it\n\n00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:37.535\nis the crisper drawer.\n\n00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:39.036\nYou all got crisper drawers?\n\n00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:40.971\nThe drawer that you put your lettuces in?\n\n00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:42.891\nLettuces have a habit of going soggy\n\n00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:44.687\nin the crisper drawers, don't they?\n\n00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:46.097\nYeah? Soggy lettuces?\n\n00:07:46.097 --> 00:07:48.097\nIn the U.K., this is such a problem\n\n00:07:48.097 --> 00:07:49.795\nthat there was a government report a few years ago\n\n00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:52.815\nthat actually said the second biggest offender\n\n00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:55.232\nof wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.\n\n00:07:55.232 --> 00:07:57.650\nIt was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.\n\n00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.863\nOkay? So this is a problem, people.\n\n00:07:59.863 --> 00:08:01.973\nThese poor little lettuces are getting thrown out\n\n00:08:01.973 --> 00:08:03.845\nleft, right and center because the crisper drawers\n\n00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:06.604\nare not designed to actually keep things crisp.\n\n00:08:06.604 --> 00:08:08.813\nOkay. You need a tight environment.\n\n00:08:08.813 --> 00:08:10.943\nYou need, like, an airless environment\n\n00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:13.668\nto prevent the degrading that\nwould happen naturally.\n\n00:08:13.668 --> 00:08:15.620\nBut the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer\n\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.328\nwith a slightly better seal.\n\n00:08:17.328 --> 00:08:19.415\nAnyway, I'm clearly obsessed.\n\n00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:22.140\nDon't ever invite me over because I'll just\nstart going through your refrigerator\n\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.658\nand looking at all sorts of things like that.\n\n00:08:23.658 --> 00:08:25.577\nBut essentially, this is a big problem.\n\n00:08:25.577 --> 00:08:28.536\nBecause when we lose something\nlike the lettuce from the system,\n\n00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:32.072\nnot only do we have that impact \nI just explained at the end of life,\n\n00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:34.728\nbut we actually have had to grow that lettuce.\n\n00:08:34.728 --> 00:08:37.999\nThe life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.\n\n00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:39.417\nWe've had to clear land.\n\n00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:41.574\nWe've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,\n\n00:08:41.574 --> 00:08:43.698\nfertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.\n\n00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:45.786\nAll of the embodied impacts in that lettuce\n\n00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:47.498\nget lost from the system,\n\n00:08:47.498 --> 00:08:50.109\nwhich makes it a far bigger environmental impact\n\n00:08:50.109 --> 00:08:53.793\nthan the loss of the energy from the fridge.\n\n00:08:53.793 --> 00:08:57.058\nSo we need to design things like this far better\n\n00:08:57.058 --> 00:09:00.239\nif we're going to start addressing\nserious environmental problems.\n\n00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.890\nWe could start with the crisper drawer and the size.\n\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.642\nFor those of you in the room who do design fridges,\n\n00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:05.135\nthat would be great.\n\n00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:08.233\nThe problem is, imagine if we\n\n00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:10.883\nactually started to reconsider \nhow we designed things.\n\n00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:14.490\nSo I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,\n\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.588\nbut we actually haven't really changed the design\n\n00:09:16.588 --> 00:09:19.259\nof them that much since the 1950s.\n\n00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:22.484\nA little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,\n\n00:09:22.484 --> 00:09:24.406\ncold boxes that we store stuff in.\n\n00:09:24.406 --> 00:09:26.226\nSo imagine if we actually really started\n\n00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:28.971\nto identify these problems and use that\n\n00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:32.908\nas the foundation for finding innovative and elegant\n\n00:09:32.908 --> 00:09:36.261\ndesign solutions that will solve those problems.\n\n00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:38.486\nThis is design-led system change,\n\n00:09:38.486 --> 00:09:42.196\ndesign dictating the way in which the system\n\n00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:44.961\ncan be far more sustainable.\n\n00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:47.055\nForty percent food waste is a major problem.\n\n00:09:47.055 --> 00:09:51.120\nImagine if we designed fridges that halved that.\n\n00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.471\nAnother item that I find fascinating\n\n00:09:53.471 --> 00:09:54.724\nis the electric tea kettle,\n\n00:09:54.724 --> 00:09:56.117\nwhich I found out that\n\n00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:59.368\nyou don't do tea kettles in\nthis country, really, do you?\n\n00:09:59.368 --> 00:10:01.456\nBut that's really big in the U.K.\n\n00:10:01.456 --> 00:10:03.689\nNinety-seven percent of households\n\n00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:06.621\nin the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.\n\n00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:08.228\nSo they're very popular.\n\n00:10:08.228 --> 00:10:11.028\nAnd, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm\n\n00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:13.280\nor a designer, and they were designing one of these,\n\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.519\nand they wanted to do it eco,\n\n00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:16.437\nthey'd usually ask me two things.\n\n00:10:16.437 --> 00:10:19.481\nThey'd say, \"Leyla, how do I\nmake it technically efficient?\"\n\n00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:22.769\nBecause obviously energy's\na problem with this product.\n\n00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:25.834\nOr, \"How do I make it green materials?\n\n00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:28.744\nHow do I make the materials green\n\n00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:30.566\nin the manufacturing?\"\n\n00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:32.369\nWould you ask me those questions?\n\n00:10:32.369 --> 00:10:35.168\nThey seem logical, right? Yeah.\n\n00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:37.727\nWell I'd say, \"You're looking at the wrong problems.\"\n\n00:10:37.727 --> 00:10:39.885\nBecause the problem is with use.\n\n00:10:39.885 --> 00:10:42.560\nIt's with how people use the product.\n\n00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.395\nSixty-five percent of Brits\n\n00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:46.739\nadmit to over-filling their kettle\n\n00:10:46.739 --> 00:10:49.325\nwhen they only need one cup of tea.\n\n00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:52.068\nAll of this extra water that's being boiled\n\n00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:56.036\nrequires energy, and it's been calculated\n\n00:10:56.036 --> 00:10:59.074\nthat in one day of extra energy use\n\n00:10:59.074 --> 00:11:00.617\nfrom boiling kettles\n\n00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:03.259\nis enough to light all of the streetlights\n\n00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:05.882\nin England for a night.\n\n00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:08.000\nBut this is the thing.\n\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.914\nThis is what I call a product-person failure.\n\n00:11:09.914 --> 00:11:12.660\nBut we've got a product-system failure\ngoing on with these little guys,\n\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.570\nand they're so ubiquitous, you \ndon't even notice they're there.\n\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.783\nAnd this guy over here, though, he does.\nHe's named Simon.\n\n00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:22.090\nSimon works for the national\nelectricity company in the U.K.\n\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.232\nHe has a very important job of monitoring\n\n00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:26.671\nall of the electricity coming into the system\n\n00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:28.084\nto make sure there is enough\n\n00:11:28.084 --> 00:11:30.012\nso it powers everybody's homes.\n\n00:11:30.012 --> 00:11:32.116\nHe's also watching television.\n\n00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:34.089\nThe reason is because there's a unique\n\n00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.907\nphenomenon that happens in the U.K.\n\n00:11:35.907 --> 00:11:39.945\nthe moment that very popular TV shows end.\n\n00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:42.183\nThe minute the ad break comes on,\n\n00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:44.020\nthis man has to rush\n\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.076\nto buy nuclear power from France,\n\n00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:49.965\nbecause everybody turns their kettles on\n\n00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:52.030\nat the same time.\n\n00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.276\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:54.276 --> 00:12:00.261\n1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.\n\n00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.830\nSo imagine if you designed kettles,\n\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.570\nyou actually found a way to\nsolve these system failures,\n\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.235\nbecause this is a huge amount of pressure\n\n00:12:09.235 --> 00:12:10.626\non the system,\n\n00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:14.062\njust because the product hasn't\nthought about the problem\n\n00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:15.925\nthat it's going to have when it exists in the world.\n\n00:12:15.925 --> 00:12:18.593\nNow, I looked at a number of\nkettles available on the market,\n\n00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:20.615\nand found the minimum fill lines,\n\n00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.381\nso the little piece of information that tells you\n\n00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:23.938\nhow much you need to put in there,\n\n00:12:23.938 --> 00:12:26.857\nwas between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water\n\n00:12:26.857 --> 00:12:30.290\njust to make one cup of tea.\n\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.575\nSo this kettle here is an example of one where\n\n00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:35.111\nit actually has two reservoirs.\n\n00:12:35.113 --> 00:12:37.298\nOne's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.\n\n00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.623\nThe user actually has to push that button\n\n00:12:39.623 --> 00:12:41.191\nto get their hot water boiled,\n\n00:12:41.191 --> 00:12:42.957\nwhich means, because we're all lazy,\n\n00:12:42.957 --> 00:12:44.799\nyou only fill exactly what you need.\n\n00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:47.123\nAnd this is what I call behavior-changing products:\n\n00:12:47.123 --> 00:12:49.235\nproducts, systems or services\n\n00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:53.094\nthat intervene and solve these problems up front.\n\n00:12:53.094 --> 00:12:55.744\nNow, this is a technology arena,\n\n00:12:55.744 --> 00:12:57.805\nso obviously these things are quite popular,\n\n00:12:57.805 --> 00:12:59.773\nbut I think if we're going to keep\n\n00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:02.359\ndesigning, buying and using and throwing out\n\n00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:04.271\nthese kinds of products at the rate we currently do,\n\n00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:06.520\nwhich is astronomically high,\n\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.354\nthere are seven billion people\n\n00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:09.764\nwho live in the world right now.\n\n00:13:09.764 --> 00:13:11.951\nThere are six billion mobile phone subscriptions\n\n00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:15.617\nas of last year.\n\n00:13:15.617 --> 00:13:19.139\nEvery single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones\n\n00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:20.392\nroll off production lines,\n\n00:13:20.392 --> 00:13:22.463\nand some companies report their production rate\n\n00:13:22.463 --> 00:13:24.813\nas being greater than the human birth rate.\n\n00:13:24.813 --> 00:13:27.943\nOne hundred fifty-two million phones \nwere thrown out in the U.S. last year;\n\n00:13:27.943 --> 00:13:29.827\nonly 11 percent were recycled.\n\n00:13:29.827 --> 00:13:33.185\nI'm from Australia. We have a\npopulation of 22 million -- don't laugh --\n\n00:13:33.185 --> 00:13:36.258\nand it's been reported that 22 million phones\n\n00:13:36.258 --> 00:13:38.865\nare in people's drawers.\n\n00:13:38.865 --> 00:13:42.586\nWe need to find ways of solving\nthe problems around this,\n\n00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:45.483\nbecause these things are so complicated.\n\n00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:48.789\nThey have so much locked up inside them.\n\n00:13:48.789 --> 00:13:52.552\nGold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now\n\n00:13:52.552 --> 00:13:56.169\nto get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones\n\n00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.397\nthan it is out of a ton of gold ore?\n\n00:13:59.397 --> 00:14:01.787\nThere's a number of highly complex and valuable\n\n00:14:01.787 --> 00:14:03.388\nmaterials embodied inside these things,\n\n00:14:03.388 --> 00:14:05.846\nso we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,\n\n00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:08.010\nbecause this is otherwise what happens.\n\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.684\nThis is a community in Ghana,\n\n00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:11.942\nand e-waste is reported, or electronic waste\n\n00:14:11.942 --> 00:14:13.918\nis reported by the U.N.\n\n00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:16.950\nas being up to 50 million tons trafficked.\n\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.264\nThis is how they get the gold\n\n00:14:18.264 --> 00:14:19.798\nand the other valuable materials out.\n\n00:14:19.798 --> 00:14:21.736\nThey burn the electronic waste\n\n00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.767\nin open spaces.\n\n00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:26.902\nThese are communities, and this\nis happening all over the world.\n\n00:14:26.902 --> 00:14:29.449\nAnd because we don't see the ramifications\n\n00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:31.278\nof the choices that we make as designers,\n\n00:14:31.278 --> 00:14:33.748\nas businesspeople, as consumers,\n\n00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.361\nthen these kinds of externalities happen,\n\n00:14:35.361 --> 00:14:37.663\nand these are people's lives.\n\n00:14:37.663 --> 00:14:42.111\nSo we need to find smarter, more systems-based,\n\n00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:45.027\ninnovative solutions to these problems,\n\n00:14:45.027 --> 00:14:48.803\nif we're going to start to live\nsustainably within this world.\n\n00:14:48.803 --> 00:14:52.776\nSo imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,\n\n00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:54.466\nyour new one because you replaced your old one --\n\n00:14:54.466 --> 00:14:56.841\nafter 15 to 18 months is the average time\n\n00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:58.945\nthat people replace their phones, by the way \u2014\n\n00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:01.930\nso if we're going to keep this kind of expedient\n\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.168\nmobile phone replacing, then we should\n\n00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:06.217\nbe looking at closing the loop on these systems.\n\n00:15:06.217 --> 00:15:08.128\nThe people who produce these phones,\n\n00:15:08.128 --> 00:15:09.957\nand some of which I'm sure\nare in the room right now,\n\n00:15:09.957 --> 00:15:12.635\ncould potentially look at doing what\nwe call closed-loop systems,\n\n00:15:12.635 --> 00:15:14.203\nor product system services,\n\n00:15:14.203 --> 00:15:16.465\nso identifying that there is a market demand\n\n00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:18.282\nand that market demand's not going to go anywhere,\n\n00:15:18.282 --> 00:15:21.335\nso you design the product to solve the problem.\n\n00:15:21.335 --> 00:15:23.674\nDesign for disassembly, design for light-weighting.\n\n00:15:23.674 --> 00:15:26.040\nWe heard some of those kinds of strategies\n\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.899\nbeing used in the Tesla Motors car today.\n\n00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:31.011\nThese kinds of approaches are not hard,\n\n00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:32.869\nbut understanding the system\n\n00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:36.400\nand then looking for viable, market-driven\n\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.383\nconsumer demand alternatives\n\n00:15:38.383 --> 00:15:40.934\nis how we can start radically altering\n\n00:15:40.934 --> 00:15:42.741\nthe sustainability agenda,\n\n00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.612\nbecause I hate to break it to you all:\n\n00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:47.415\nConsumption is the biggest problem.\n\n00:15:47.415 --> 00:15:52.677\nBut design is one of the best solutions.\n\n00:15:52.677 --> 00:15:54.861\nThese kinds of products are everywhere.\n\n00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:57.529\nBy identifying alternative ways of doing things,\n\n00:15:57.529 --> 00:15:59.124\nwe can actually start to innovate,\n\n00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.517\nand I say actually start to innovate.\n\n00:16:00.517 --> 00:16:03.002\nI'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.\n\n00:16:03.002 --> 00:16:05.356\nBut in the regards to using sustainability\n\n00:16:05.356 --> 00:16:08.043\nas a parameter, as a criteria\n\n00:16:08.043 --> 00:16:12.260\nfor fueling systems-based solutions,\n\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.165\nbecause as I've just demonstrated\nwith these simple products,\n\n00:16:15.165 --> 00:16:18.556\nthey're participating in these major problems.\n\n00:16:18.556 --> 00:16:20.711\nSo we need to look across the entire life\n\n00:16:20.711 --> 00:16:22.333\nof the things that we do.\n\n00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:24.048\nIf you just had paper or plastic --\n\n00:16:24.048 --> 00:16:26.812\nobviously reusable is far more beneficial --\n\n00:16:26.812 --> 00:16:30.283\nthen the paper is worse,\n\n00:16:30.283 --> 00:16:32.329\nand the paper is worse because it weighs\n\n00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:34.433\nfour to 10 times more than the plastic,\n\n00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:36.800\nand when we actually compare,\nfrom a life cycle perspective,\n\n00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.490\na kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,\n\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.136\nthe paper is far better,\n\n00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:43.676\nbut the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag\n\n00:16:43.676 --> 00:16:47.291\nto carry your groceries home is not \ndone with a kilo of each material.\n\n00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:49.260\nIt's done with a very small amount of plastic\n\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.953\nand quite a lot more paper.\n\n00:16:50.953 --> 00:16:53.911\nBecause functionality defines environmental impact,\n\n00:16:53.911 --> 00:16:56.744\nand I said earlier that the designers\nalways ask me for the eco-materials.\n\n00:16:56.744 --> 00:16:59.768\nI say, there's only a few materials\nthat you should completely avoid.\n\n00:16:59.789 --> 00:17:01.688\nThe rest of them, it's all about application,\n\n00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.707\nand at the end of the day, everything\nwe design and produce in the economy\n\n00:17:04.707 --> 00:17:07.047\nor buy as consumers is done so for function.\n\n00:17:07.047 --> 00:17:09.164\nWe want something, therefore we buy it.\n\n00:17:09.164 --> 00:17:12.320\nSo breaking things back down and delivering\n\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.319\nsmartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions\n\n00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.116\nthat take into consideration the entire system\n\n00:17:19.116 --> 00:17:22.211\nand the entire life of the thing, everything,\n\n00:17:22.211 --> 00:17:25.047\nall the way back to the extraction\nthrough to the end of life,\n\n00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:27.849\nwe can start to actually find\nreally innovative solutions.\n\n00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.919\nAnd I'll just leave you with one very quick thing\n\n00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:33.776\nthat a designer said to me recently \nwho I work with, a senior designer.\n\n00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:36.874\nI said, \"How come you're not doing \nsustainability? I know you know this.\"\n\n00:17:36.874 --> 00:17:40.886\nAnd he said, \"Well, recently I pitched\na sustainability project to a client,\n\n00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:42.827\nand turned and he said to me,\n\n00:17:42.827 --> 00:17:44.592\n'I know it's going to cost less,\n\n00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:46.210\nI know it's going to sell more,\n\n00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.683\nbut we're not pioneers, because\npioneers have arrows in their backs.'\"\n\n00:17:50.683 --> 00:17:52.900\nI think we've got a roomful of pioneers,\n\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.954\nand I hope there are far more pioneers out there,\nbecause we need to solve these problems.\n\n00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:57.392\nThank you.\n\n00:17:57.392 --> 00:18:02.168\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The investment logic for sustainability", "duration": "739", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_mcknett_the_investment_logic_for_sustainability", "transcript": "The world is changing in some really profound ways, and I worry that investors aren't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change, especially when it comes to sustainability. And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things, like environmental and social issues and corporate governance. I think it's reckless to ignore these things, because doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns. And here's something that may surprise you: the balance of power to really influence sustainability rests with institutional investors, the large investors like pension funds, foundations and endowments. I believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think, better-performing than you believe, and more important than we can imagine.Let me remind you what we already know. We have a population that's both growing and aging; we have seven billion souls today heading to 10 billion at the end of the century; we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished; and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing. Now clearly, these are environmental and social issues, but that's not all. They're economic issues, and that makes them relevant to risk and return. And they are really complex and they can seem really far off, that the temptation may be to do this: bury our heads in the sand and not think about it. Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home. (Laughter)But it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today are fit for purpose tomorrow. We know that investors, when they look at a company and decide whether to invest, they look at financial data, metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share, valuation \u2014 you know, the really sexy stuff. And these things are fundamental, of course, but they're not enough. Investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call ESG: environment, social and governance. Environment includes energy consumption, water availability, waste and pollution, just making efficient uses of resources. Social includes human capital, things like employee engagement and innovation capacity, as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights. And governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors. See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff. But ESG is the measure of sustainability, and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process. It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet, and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes.So if sustainability matters financially today, and all signs indicate more tomorrow, is the private sector paying attention? Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are. They started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success. About 80 percent of global CEOs see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation and leading to competitive advantage in their industries. But 93 percent see ESG as the future, or as important to the future of their business. So the views of CEOs are clear. There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.So how are companies actually leveraging ESG to drive hard business results? One example is near and dear to our hearts. In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications to the cloud environment, and we retired another 85. We virtualized our operating system environments, and we completed numerous automation projects. Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace, and they reduce our real estate footprint, and they yield savings of 23 million dollars in operating costs annually, and avoid the emissions of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon. That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars off the road. So awesome, right? Another example is Pentair. Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate, and about a decade ago, they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business. That's a really big bet. Why did they do that? Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans, there's more growth in water than in power tools, and this company has their sights set on what they call \"the new New World.\" That's four billion middle class people demanding food, energy and water.Now, you may be asking yourself, are these just isolated cases? I mean, come on, really? Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially? The answer that may surprise you is yes. The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others. In blue, we see the MSCI World. It's an index of large companies from developed markets across the world. And in gold, we see a subset of companies rated as having the best ESG performance. Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff. So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more. In some cases, there may be outperformance from ESG. In blue, we see the performance of the 500 largest global companies, and in gold, we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management. Now over almost eight years, they've outperformed by about two thirds. So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation. But it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns.So if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm? Are investors, particularly institutional investors, engaged? Well, some are, and a few are really at the vanguard. Hesta. Hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in Australia, with assets of 22 billion [dollars]. They believe that ESG has the potential to impact risks and returns, so incorporating it into the investment process is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members, core to their duty. You gotta love the Aussies, right? CalPERS is another example. CalPERS is the pension fund for public employees in California, and with assets of 244 billion [dollars], they are the second largest in the U.S. and the sixth largest in the world. Now, they're moving toward 100 percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated ESG across the entire fund. Why? They believe it's critical to superior long-term returns, full stop. In their own words, \"long-term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital: financial, human, and physical. This is why we are concerned with ESG.\"Now, I do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job, and not all of them see it this way. Often I hear, \"We are required to maximize returns, so we don't do that here,\" or, \"We don't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements.\" The one that just really gets under my skin is, \"If you want to do something about that, just make money, give the profits to charities.\" It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.I mean, let me clarify something right here. Companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet. They don't have indefinite social obligations, and prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability. They're compatible. So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here. But institutional investors are the x-factor in sustainability. Why do they hold the key? The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money. (Laughter) A lot of it. I mean, a really lot of it. The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars. The global bond market, 78 trillion. That's 133 trillion combined. That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S. That's the world's largest economy. That's some serious freaking firepower.So we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges, like fresh water, clean air, feeding 10 billion mouths, if institutional investors integrated ESG into investment. What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them? What if we work and save and invest, only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now? What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?Now a fair question might be, what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent, something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice? Well, President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on: \"There are risks and costs to a program of action, but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.\" I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this, but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus, the odds that it's not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we'll get in a car accident. Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter) But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen, right? So by investing sustainably we're doing two things. We're creating insurance, reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy, and at the same time, in the short term, we're not sacrificing performance. [Man in comic: \"What if it's a big hoax  and we create a better world for nothing?\"]Good, you like it. I like it too. (Laughter) I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue. I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.

00:03:33.545\nand sustainable outcomes.\n\n00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:36.709\nSo if sustainability matters financially today,\n\n00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.201\nand all signs indicate more tomorrow,\n\n00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:42.699\nis the private sector paying attention?\n\n00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:48.680\nWell, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.\n\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.246\nThey started to see sustainability\n\n00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:54.490\nnot just as important but crucial to business success.\n\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.904\nAbout 80 percent of global CEOs\n\n00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:00.995\nsee sustainability as the root to growth in innovation\n\n00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:03.388\nand leading to competitive advantage\n\n00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.112\nin their industries.\n\n00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:08.285\nBut 93 percent see ESG as the future,\n\n00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:11.334\nor as important to the future of their business.\n\n00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.551\nSo the views of CEOs are clear.\n\n00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:17.738\nThere's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.\n\n00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:21.266\nSo how are companies actually leveraging ESG\n\n00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:24.068\nto drive hard business results?\n\n00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:26.589\nOne example is near and dear to our hearts.\n\n00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:30.023\nIn 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications\n\n00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:31.669\nto the cloud environment,\n\n00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.098\nand we retired another 85.\n\n00:04:34.098 --> 00:04:36.804\nWe virtualized our operating system environments,\n\n00:04:36.804 --> 00:04:40.267\nand we completed numerous automation projects.\n\n00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.799\nNow these initiatives create\na more mobile workplace,\n\n00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.583\nand they reduce our real estate footprint,\n\n00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:48.223\nand they yield savings of 23 million dollars\n\n00:04:48.223 --> 00:04:51.223\nin operating costs annually,\n\n00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:53.059\nand avoid the emissions\n\n00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.509\nof a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.\n\n00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.542\nThat's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars\n\n00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:02.331\noff the road.\n\n00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:04.970\nSo awesome, right?\n\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.934\nAnother example is Pentair.\n\n00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:10.263\nPentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,\n\n00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:11.843\nand about a decade

00:05:22.551\nThat's a really big bet.

We want more.

Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age, our size, even our lifestyle and personality. In the words of the poet Longfellow, \"the human voice is the organ of the soul.\" As a speech scientist, I'm fascinated by how the voice is produced, and I have an idea for how it can be engineered. That's what I'd like to share with you.I'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize.(Recording) Stephen Hawking: \"I would have thought it was fairly obvious what I meant.\"Rupal Patel: That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking. What you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition. In fact, all of these individuals may be using the same voice, and that's because there's only a few options available. In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans who are unable to speak, and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate. Now that's millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices, including Professor Hawking, who uses an American-accented voice. This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago, and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices, different devices, but the same voice. And I looked around and I saw this happening all around me, literally hundreds of individuals using a handful of voices, voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities. We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man. So why then the same prosthetic voice? It really struck me, and I wanted to do something about this.I'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has, two people actually, who have severe speech disorders. I want you to take a listen to how they sound. They're saying the same utterance.(First voice)(Second voice) You probably didn't understand what they said, but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities.So what I wanted to do next is, I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them, voices that could be customized for them. So I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell. Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis, and what he'd been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together pre-recorded samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them. These are people who had lost their voice later in life. We didn't have the luxury of pre-recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder. But I thought, there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over.So we decided to do exactly that. We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation, to create custom-crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities. We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D., for vocal identity.Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it, I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay? So first, we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development. Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults. We've all experienced this. Fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source, which is the vibrations generated by your voice box, which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract. These are the chambers of your head and neck that vibrate, and they actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels. So the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech. And that happens in one individual.Now I told you earlier that I'd spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder, and what I've found is that even though their filters were impaired, they were able to modulate their source: the pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice. These are called prosody, and I've been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved. So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity, I had this idea. Why don't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like, because it's preserved, and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size, because they can articulate speech, and then mix them? Because when we mix them, we can get a voice that's as clear as our surrogate talker \u2014 that's the person we borrowed the filter from\u2014 and is similar in identity to our target talker. It's that simple. That's the science behind what we're doing.So once you have that in mind, how do you go about building this voice? Well, you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate. It's not such an ominous thing. Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this.(Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs.I love to sleep.The sky is blue without clouds.RP: Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours, and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say, but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. The more speech you have, the better sounding voice you're going to have. Once you have those recordings, what we need to do is we have to parse these recordings into little snippets of speech, one- or two-sound combinations, sometimes even whole words that start populating a dataset or a database. We're going to call this database a voice bank. Now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank, we can now say any new utterance, like, \"I love chocolate\" \u2014 everyone needs to be able to say that\u2014 fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance.(Video) Voice: I love chocolate.RP: So that's speech synthesis. It's called concatenative synthesis, and that's what we're using. That's not the novel part. What's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman.This is Samantha. I met her when she was nine, and since then, my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice. We first had to find a surrogate donor, and then we had to have Samantha produce some utterances. What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds, but that's enough for us to extract her source characteristics. What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's six. She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's beautiful. It's exactly that. Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this.(Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah.RP: So now, Samantha can say this.(Video) Samantha: This voice is only for me. I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends.RP: Thank you. (Applause)I'll never forget the gentle smile that spread across her face when she heard that voice for the first time. Now there's millions of people around the world like Samantha, millions, and we've only begun to scratch the surface. What we've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S. who have donated their voices, and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices. But there's so much more work to be done. For Samantha, her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. And as a scientist, I'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have real-world impact. What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level. I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages, coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. To do that as a first step, we've put together this website, VocaliD.org, as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors, as expertise donors, in whatever way to make this vision a reality.They say that giving blood can save lives. Well, giving your voice can change lives. All we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker, and as little as a vowel from our target talker, to create a unique vocal identity.So that's the science behind what we're doing. I want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work. About five years ago, we built our very first voice for a little boy named William. When his mom first heard this voice, she said, \"This is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak.\" And then I saw William typing a message on his device. I wondered, what was he thinking? Imagine carrying around someone else's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice. Imagine that.This is what William said: \"Never heard me before.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1928, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.677 -->

00:00:54.438\nRupal Patel: That was the voice\n\n00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:56.524\nof Professor Stephen Hawking.\n\n00:00:56.524 --> 00:01:00.373\nWhat you may not know is that same voice\n\n00:01:00.373 --> 00:01:02.851\nmay also be used by this little girl\n\n00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.548\nwho is unable to speak\n\n00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:07.145\nbecause of a neurological condition.\n\n00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:09.213\nIn fact, all of these individuals\n\n00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:11.225\nmay be using the same voice,\n\n00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:14.782\nand that's because there's\nonly a few options available.\n\n00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:19.099\nIn the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans\n\n00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.709\nwho are unable to speak,\n\n00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.331\nand many of whom use computerized devices\n\n00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:24.853\nto communicate.\n\n00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:28.332\nNow that's millions of people worldwide\n\n00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:29.984\nwho are using generic voices,\n\n00:01:29.984 --> 00:01:31.430\nincluding Professor Hawking,\n\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.263\nwho uses an American-accented voice.\n\n00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.591\nThis lack of individuation of the synthetic voice\n\n00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:41.007\nreally hit home\n\n00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:43.479\nwhen I was at an assistive technology conference\n\n00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.329\na few years ago,\n\n00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.933\nand I recall walking into an exhibit hall\n\n00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.977\nand seeing a little girl and a grown man\n\n00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.893\nhaving a conversation using their devices,\n\n00:01:54.893 --> 00:01:59.177\ndifferent devices, but the same voice.\n\n00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:01.086\nAnd I looked around and I saw this happening\n\n00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:05.276\nall around me, literally hundreds of individuals\n\n00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:08.014\nusing a handful of voices,\n\n00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.105\nvoices that didn't fit their bodies\n\n00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:13.187\nor their personalities.\n\n00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:15.914\nWe wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl\n\n00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:19.310\nwith the prosthetic limb of a grown man.\n\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.614\nSo why then the same prosthetic voice?\n\n00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:23.905\nIt really struck me,\n\n00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:27.056\nand I wanted to do something about this.\n\n00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:29.009\nI'm going to play you now a sample\n\n00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.297\nof someone who has, two people actually,\n\n00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:34.065\nwho have severe speech disorders.\n\n00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:37.295\nI want you to take a listen to how they sound.\n\n00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:39.652\nThey're saying the same utterance.\n\n00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:42.084\n(First voice)\n\n00:02:42.084 --> 00:02:45.701\n(Second voice)\n\n00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:48.113\nYou probably didn't understand what they said,\n\n00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:49.967\nbut I hope that you heard\n\n00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:54.250\ntheir unique vocal identities.\n\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.063\nSo what I wanted to do next is,\n\n00:02:57.063 --> 00:02:59.447\nI wanted to find out how we could harness\n\n00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:01.268\nthese residual vocal abilities\n\n00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:03.284\nand build a technology\n\n00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:05.427\nthat could be customized for them,\n\n00:03:05.427 --> 00:03:07.856\nvoices that could be customized for them.\n\n00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:10.541\nSo I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell.\n\n00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.604\nDr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis,\n\n00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:15.637\nand what he'd been doing is building\n\n00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:17.518\npersonalized voices for people\n\n00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:19.615\nby putting together\n\n00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:21.765\npre-recorded samples of their voice\n\n00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:24.644\nand reconstructing a voice for them.\n\n00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:26.356\nThese are people who had lost their voice\n\n00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:28.267\nlater in life.\n\n00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:29.661\nWe didn't have the luxury\n\n00:03:29.661 --> 00:03:31.435\nof pre-recorded samples of speech\n\n00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:33.727\nfor those born with speech disorder.\n\n00:03:33.727 --> 00:03:36.264\nBut I thought, there had to be a way\n\n00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:38.208\nto reverse engineer a voice\n\n00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:40.499\nfrom whatever little is left over.\n\n00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.213\nSo we decided to do exactly that.\n\n00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:46.616\nWe set out with a little bit of funding\nfrom the National Science Foundation,\n\n00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:50.181\nto create custom-crafted voices that captured\n\n00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:51.717\ntheir unique vocal identities.\n\n00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:54.920\nWe call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D.,\n\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.953\nfor vocal identity.\n\n00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:59.627\nNow before I get into the details of how\n\n00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:01.675\nthe voice is made and let you listen to it,\n\n00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:05.025\nI need to give you a real quick\nspeech science lesson. Okay?\n\n00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:08.184\nSo first, we know that the voice is changing\n\n00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:11.038\ndramatically over the course of development.\n\n00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:13.128\nChildren sound different from teens\n\n00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.591\nwho sound different from adults.\n\n00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.233\nWe've all experienced this.\n\n00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:20.596\nFact number two is that speech\n\n00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:23.149\nis a combination of the source,\n\n00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:26.628\nwhich is the vibrations generated by your voice box,\n\n00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:28.567\nwhich are then pushed through\n\n00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.004\nthe rest of the vocal tract.\n\n00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.488\nThese are the chambers of your head and neck\n\n00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:34.727\nthat vibrate,\n\n00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:36.837\nand they actually filter that source sound\n\n00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:39.374\nto produce consonants and vowels.\n\n00:04:39.374 --> 00:04:43.234\nSo the combination of source and filter\n\n00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:45.864\nis how we produce speech.\n\n00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:48.890\nAnd that happens in one individual.\n\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.516\nNow I told you earlier that I'd spent\n\n00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:53.541\na good part of my career\n\n00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.994\nunderstanding and studying\n\n00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.952\nthe source characteristics of people\n\n00:04:57.952 --> 00:05:00.253\nwith severe speech disorder,\n\n00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:01.718\nand what I've found\n\n00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:05.084\nis that even though their filters were impaired,\n\n00:05:05.084 --> 00:05:08.045\nthey were able to modulate their source:\n\n00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:11.307\nthe pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.\n\n00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:14.675\nThese are called prosody, and\nI've been documenting for years\n\n00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:16.952\nthat the prosodic abilities of these individuals\n\n00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:18.527\nare preserved.\n\n00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:22.614\nSo when I realized that those same cues\n\n00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:25.383\nare also important for speaker identity,\n\n00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:27.398\nI had this idea.\n\n00:05:27.398 --> 00:05:29.914\nWhy don't we take the source\n\n00:05:29.914 --> 00:05:32.127\nfrom the person we want the voice to sound like,\n\n00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:33.590\nbecause it's preserved,\n\n00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.725\nand borrow the filter\n\n00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:38.954\nfrom someone about the same age and size,\n\n00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.376\nbecause they can articulate speech,\n\n00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:43.167\nand then mix them?\n\n00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:44.954\nBecause when we mix them,\n\n00:05:44.954 --> 00:05:46.652\nwe can get a voice that's as clear\n\n00:05:46.652 --> 00:05:48.406\nas our surrogate talker --\n\n00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:51.001\nthat's the person we borrowed the filter from\u2014\n\n00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:55.650\nand is similar in identity to our target talker.\n\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.077\nIt's that simple.\n\n00:05:57.077 --> 00:06:00.011\nThat's the science behind what we're doing.\n\n00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:03.544\nSo once you have that in mind,\n\n00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:05.802\nhow do you go about building this voice?\n\n00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:07.282\nWell, you have to find someone\n\n00:06:07.282 --> 00:06:09.682\nwho is willing to be a surrogate.\n\n00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:11.946\nIt's not such an ominous thing.\n\n00:06:11.946 --> 00:06:13.469\nBeing a surrogate donor\n\n00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.257\nonly requires you to say a few hundred\n\n00:06:16.257 --> 00:06:18.499\nto a few thousand utterances.\n\n00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.502\nThe process goes something like this.\n\n00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:22.692\n(Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs.\n\n00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:24.617\nI love to sleep.\n\n00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:28.499\nThe sky is blue without clouds.\n\n00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.501\nRP: Now she's going to go on like this\n\n00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:32.420\nfor about three to four hours,\n\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.425\nand the idea is not for her to say everything\n\n00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:37.470\nthat the target is going to want to say,\n\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.865\nbut the idea is to cover all the different combinations\n\n00:06:40.865 --> 00:06:44.136\nof the sounds that occur in the language.\n\n00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:45.774\nThe more speech you have,\n\n00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:48.079\nthe better sounding voice you're going to have.\n\n00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:49.752\nOnce you have those recordings,\n\n00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:51.165\nwhat we need to do\n\n00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:53.883\nis we have to parse these recordings\n\n00:06:53.883 --> 00:06:56.332\ninto little snippets of speech,\n\n00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.669\none- or two-sound combinations,\n\n00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.552\nsometimes even whole words\n\n00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:05.068\nthat start populating a dataset or a database.\n\n00:07:05.068 --> 00:07:08.785\nWe're going to call this database a voice bank.\n\n00:07:08.785 --> 00:07:10.881\nNow the power of the voice bank\n\n00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:12.895\nis that from this voice bank,\n\n00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:14.906\nwe can now say any new utterance,\n\n00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:16.330\nlike, \"I love chocolate\" --\n\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.069\neveryone needs to be able to say that\u2014\n\n00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:19.900\nfish through that database\n\n00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.840\nand find all the segments necessary\n\n00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.769\nto say that utterance.\n\n00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:25.558\n(Video) Voice: I love chocolate.\n\n00:07:25.558 --> 00:07:26.949\nRP: So that's speech synthesis.\n\n00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:29.522\nIt's called concatenative synthesis,\nand that's what we're using.\n\n00:07:29.522 --> 00:07:31.055\nThat's not the novel part.\n\n00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:33.276\nWhat's novel is how we make it sound\n\n00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:34.733\nlike this young woman.\n\n00:07:34.733 --> 00:07:36.257\nThis is Samantha.\n\n00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:38.603\nI met her when she was nine,\n\n00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:40.500\nand since then, my team and I\n\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.214\nhave been trying to build her a personalized voice.\n\n00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:46.313\nWe first had to find a surrogate donor,\n\n00:07:46.313 --> 00:07:48.131\nand then we had to have Samantha\n\n00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:50.060\nproduce some utterances.\n\n00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.439\nWhat she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds,\n\n00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:54.918\nbut that's enough for us to extract\n\n00:07:54.918 --> 00:07:57.203\nher source characteristics.\n\n00:07:57.203 --> 00:08:00.474\nWhat happens next is best described\n\n00:08:00.474 --> 00:08:03.241\nby my daughter's analogy.

It's a hard term to define in so far as it has a very wide application. I can love jogging. I can love a book, a movie. I can love escalopes. I can love my wife. (Laughter)But there's a great difference between an escalope and my wife, for instance. That is, if I value the escalope, the escalope, on the other hand,  it doesn't value me back. Whereas my wife, she calls me the star of her life. (Laughter)Therefore, only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being. I know this, that's why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired. Hence the eternal problem of love: how to become and remain desirable?The individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules. You had a specific part to play according to your sex, your age, your social status, and you only had to play your part to be valued and loved by the whole community. Think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage. Think about the youngest son  who must obey the eldest son, who in turn must obey the patriarch.But a phenomenon started in the 13th century, mainly in the Renaissance, in the West, that caused the biggest identity crisis in the history of humankind. This phenomenon is modernity. We can basically summarize it through a triple process. First, a process of rationalization of scientific research, which has accelerated technical progress. Next, a process of political democratization, which has fostered individual rights. And finally, a process of rationalization  of economic production and of trade liberalization.These three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of Western societies, with radical consequences for the individual. Now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude, any choice, any object. But as a result, they are themselves confronted with this same freedom that others have to value or disvalue them. In other words, my value was once ensured by submitting myself  to the traditional authorities. Now it is quoted in the stock exchange.On the free market of individual desires, I negotiate my value every day. Hence the anxiety of contemporary man. He is obsessed: \"Am I desirable? How desirable? How many people are going to love me?\" And how does he respond to this anxiety? Well, by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability. (Laughter)I call this act of collecting, along with others, seduction capital. Indeed, our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital. It is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic. But it's not true! We only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds. We do it to make them love us, to seduce them. Nothing could be less materialistic,  or more sentimental, than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees, because he wants to please Jennifer. (Laughter) Consumerism is not materialism. It is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love, or rather in the name of seduction capital.In light of this observation on contemporary love, how can we think of love in the years to come? We can envision two hypotheses: The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic  capitalization will intensify. It is hard to say what shape  this intensification will take, because it largely depends on social and technical innovations, which are by definition difficult to predict. But we can, for instance, imagine a dating website which, a bit like those loyalty points programs, uses seduction capital points that vary according to my age,  my height/weight ratio, my degree, my salary, or the number of clicks on my profile. We can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment.By the way, there's a program on MTV already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease. These teachers call themselves \"pick-up artists.\" \"Artist\" in French is easy, it means \"artiste.\" \"Pick-up\" is to pick someone up, but not just any picking up \u2014 it's picking up chicks. So they are artists of picking up chicks. (Laughter) And they call heartache \"one-itis.\" In English, \"itis\" is a suffix that signifies infection. One-itis can be translated as \"an infection from one.\" It's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists, falling in love with someone is a waste of time, it's squandering your seduction capital, so it must be eliminated like a disease, like an infection. We can also envision a romantic use of the genome. Everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction. (Laughter)Of course, this race for seduction, like every fierce competition, will create huge disparities  in narcissistic satisfaction, and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too. So we can expect that modernity itself, which is the origin of seduction capital, would be called into question. I'm thinking particularly of the reaction of neo-fascist or religious communes. But such a future doesn't have to be.Another path to thinking about love may be possible. But how? How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued? Well, by becoming aware of my uselessness. (Laughter) Yes, I'm useless. But rest assured: so are you. (Laughter) (Applause)We are all useless. This uselessness is easily demonstrated, because in order to be valued I need another to desire me, which shows that I do not have any value of my own. I don't have any inherent value. We all pretend to have an idol; we all pretend to be an idol for someone else, but actually we are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street who appears totally cool and indifferent, while he has actually anticipated and calculated so that all eyes are on him.I think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships. It is because I want to be loved from head to toe, justified in my every choice, that the seduction hysteria exists. And therefore I want to seem perfect so that another can love me. I want them to be perfect so that I can be reassured of my value. It leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up, just like that, at the slightest underachievement.In contrast to this attitude, I call upon tenderness \u2014 love as tenderness. What is tenderness? To be tender is to accept  the loved one's weaknesses. It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies. (Laughter) That's pretty bad. On the contrary, there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness. I refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused. It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.I refer to self-mockery.

We only accumulate objects\n\n00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:31.459\nin order to communicate with other minds.\n\n00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:36.876\nWe do it to make them love us, to seduce them.\n\n00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:40.596\nNothing could be less materialistic, \nor more sentimental,\n\n00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:44.821\nthan a teenager buying brand new jeans\n\n00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:47.313\nand tearing them at the knees,\n\n00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:49.425\nbecause he wants to please Jennifer.\n\n00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:51.875\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.159\nConsumerism is not materialism.\n\n00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.234\nIt is rather what is swallowed up\n\n00:04:57.234 --> 00:05:00.243\nand sacrificed in the name of the god of love,\n\n00:05:00.243 --> 00:05:04.689\nor rather in the name of seduction capital.\n\n00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.070\nIn light of this observation on contemporary love,\n\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.385\nhow can we think of love in the years to come?\n\n00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.669\nWe can envision two hypotheses:\n\n00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.405\nThe first one consists of betting\n\n00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:24.099\nthat this process of narcissistic \ncapitalization will intensify.\n\n00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.167\nIt is hard to say what shape \nthis intensification will take,\n\n00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:29.898\nbecause it largely depends\n\n00:05:29.898 --> 00:05:32.666\non social and technical innovations,\n\n00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:37.713\nwhich are by definition difficult to predict.\n\n00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:39.615\nBut we can, for instance,\n\n00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:43.339\nimagine a dating website\n\n00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:47.471\nwhich, a bit like those loyalty points programs,\n\n00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:50.663\nuses seduction capital points\n\n00:05:50.663 --> 00:05:54.458\nthat vary according to my age, \nmy height/weight ratio,\n\n00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:56.981\nmy degree, my salary,\n\n00:05:56.981 --> 00:06:01.446\nor the number of clicks on my profile.\n\n00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:05.332\nWe can also imagine\n\n00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:08.705\na chemical treatment for breakups\n\n00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:12.523\nthat weakens the feelings of attachment.\n\n00:06:12.523 --> 00:06:16.580\nBy the way, there's a program on MTV already\n\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.564\nin which seduction teachers\n\n00:06:20.564 --> 00:06:24.482\ntreat heartache as a disease.\n\n00:06:24.482 --> 00:06:28.184\nThese teachers call themselves \"pick-up artists.\"\n\n00:06:28.184 --> 00:06:31.428\n\"Artist\" in French is easy, it means \"artiste.\"\n\n00:06:31.428 --> 00:06:34.140\n\"Pick-up\" is to pick someone up,\n\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.256\nbut not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks.\n\n00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:40.725\nSo they are artists of picking up chicks.\n\n00:06:40.725 --> 00:06:42.182\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:42.182 --> 00:06:47.297\nAnd they call heartache \"one-itis.\"\n\n00:06:47.297 --> 00:06:50.847\nIn English, \"itis\" is a suffix that signifies infection.\n\n00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:55.311\nOne-itis can be translated as \"an infection from one.\"\n\n00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:59.080\nIt's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists,\n\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.529\nfalling in love with someone\n\n00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:04.361\nis a waste of time,\n\n00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:06.268\nit's squandering your seduction capital,\n\n00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:08.060\nso it must be eliminated\n\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.789\nlike a disease, like an infection.\n\n00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.490\nWe can also envision\n\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.507\na romantic use of the genome.\n\n00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:22.157\nEveryone would carry it around\n\n00:07:22.157 --> 00:07:25.357\nand present it like a business card\n\n00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:30.351\nto verify if seduction can progress to reproduction.\n\n00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:33.979\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:39.142\nOf course, this race for seduction,\n\n00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:41.245\nlike every fierce competition,\n\n00:07:41.245 --> 00:07:46.178\nwill create huge disparities \nin narcissistic satisfaction,\n\n00:07:46.178 --> 00:07:50.228\nand therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too.\n\n00:07:50.228 --> 00:07:52.972\nSo we can expect that modernity itself,\n\n00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:57.508\nwhich is the origin of seduction capital,\nwould be called into question.\n\n00:07:57.508 --> 00:08:00.139\nI'm thinking particularly of the reaction\n\n00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:05.068\nof neo-fascist or religious communes.\n\n00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:10.704\nBut such a future doesn't have to be.\n\n00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:16.126\nAnother path to thinking about love may be possible.\n\n00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:18.216\nBut how?\n\n00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:22.530\nHow to renounce the hysterical need to be valued?\n\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.738\nWell, by becoming aware\nof my uselessness.\n\n00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:28.837\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:28.837 --> 00:08:29.776\nYes,\n\n00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:32.067\nI'm useless.\n\n00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:33.938\nBut rest assured:\n\n00:08:33.938 --> 00:08:35.400\nso are you.\n\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.550\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.587\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:45.957\nWe are all useless.\n\n00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:48.372\nThis uselessness is easily demonstrated,\n\n00:08:48.372 --> 00:08:51.973\nbecause in order to be valued\n\n00:08:51.973 --> 00:08:54.984\nI need another to desire me,\n\n00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:57.274\nwhich shows that I do not have any value of my own.\n\n00:08:57.274 --> 00:09:00.358\nI don't have any inherent value.\n\n00:09:02.722 --> 00:09:05.447\nWe all pretend to have an idol;\n\n00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:08.366\nwe all pretend to be an idol for\nsomeone else, but actually\n\n00:09:08.366 --> 00:09:11.788\nwe are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street\n\n00:09:11.788 --> 00:09:14.647\nwho appears totally cool and indifferent,\n\n00:09:14.647 --> 00:09:17.796\nwhile he has actually anticipated and calculated\n\n00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:21.401\nso that all eyes are on him.\n\n00:09:21.401 --> 00:09:22.970\nI think that becoming aware\n\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.177\nof this general imposture\n\n00:09:25.177 --> 00:09:26.585\nthat concerns all of us\n\n00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:28.405\nwould ease our love relationships.\n\n00:09:28.405 --> 00:09:30.795\nIt is because I want to be loved\n\n00:09:30.795 --> 00:09:32.292\nfrom head to toe,\n\n00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:34.267\njustified in my every choice,\n\n00:09:34.267 --> 00:09:37.039\nthat the seduction hysteria exists.\n\n00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:39.332\nAnd therefore I want to seem perfect\n\n00:09:39.332 --> 00:09:40.952\nso that another can love me.\n\n00:09:40.952 --> 00:09:42.479\nI want them to be perfect\n\n00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:44.636\nso that I can be reassured of my value.\n\n00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:47.023\nIt leads to couples\n\n00:09:47.023 --> 00:09:49.315\nobsessed with performance\n\n00:09:49.315 --> 00:09:51.471\nwho will break up, just like that,\n\n00:09:51.471 --> 00:09:54.025\nat the slightest underachievement.\n\n00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:58.148\nIn contrast to this attitude,\n\n00:09:58.148 --> 00:10:00.886\nI call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness.\n\n00:10:00.886 --> 00:10:02.254\nWhat is tenderness?\n\n00:10:02.254 --> 00:10:06.127\nTo be tender is to accept \nthe loved one's weaknesses.\n\n00:10:06.127 --> 00:10:09.784\nIt's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.\n\n00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:10.979\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:13.049\nThat's pretty bad.\n\n00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:14.381\nOn the contrary,\n\n00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:17.147\nthere's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.\n\n00:10:17.147 --> 00:10:21.196\nI refer specifically to a kind of humor\nthat is unfortunately underused.\n\n00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:24.073\nIt is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.\n\n00:10:24.073 --> 00:10:26.854\nI refer to self-mockery.\n\n00:10:26.854 --> 00:10:29.675\nFor a couple who is no longer sustained, supported\n\n00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:31.752\nby the constraints of tradition,\n\n00:10:31.752 -->

Whatever life throws at us, whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or even broken bones, we want to try and get better. Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab, and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time.Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell. This was actually used by the Mayans as an artificial tooth replacement. We're not quite sure why they did it. It's hard. It's durable. But it also had other very nice properties. In fact, when they put it into the jawbone, it could integrate into the jaw, and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry, has a beautiful architecture. And I think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology.(Laughter)But if we move on and think throughout history how people have used different  materials in the body, very often it's been physicians that have been quite creative. They've taken things off the shelf.One of my favorite examples is that of Sir Harold Ridley, who was a famous ophthalmologist, or at least became a famous ophthalmologist. And during World War II, what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions, and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye, but the very interesting thing about it was that material, actually, wasn't causing any inflammatory response. So he looked into this, and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires. And this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses. It's called PMMA, and it's now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts.And that example, I think, is a really nice one, because it helps remind us that in the early days, people often chose materials because they were bioinert. Their very purpose was to  perform a mechanical function. You'd put them in the body and you wouldn't get an adverse response. And what I want to show you is that in regenerative medicine, we've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material. We're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body, and that furthermore we can put in the body, they'll have their function, and then they'll dissolve away over time.If we look at this schematic, this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue-engineering approach. We have cells there, typically from the patient. We can put those onto a material, and we can make that material  very complex if we want to, and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient. And this is an approach that's  used all over the world, including in our lab.But one of the things that's really important when we're thinking about stem cells is that obviously stem cells  can be many different things, and they want to be many different things, and so we want to make sure that the environment we put them into has enough information so that they can become the right sort of specialist tissue. And if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world, in all the  different labs in the world, there's pretty much every tissue you can think of. And actually, the structure of those tissues is quite different, and it's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease, other conditions, in terms of how you're going to regenerate your tissue, and you're going to need to think about the materials you're going to use really carefully, their biochemistry, their mechanics, and many other properties as well.Our tissues all have very  different abilities to regenerate, and here we see poor Prometheus, who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the Greek gods. He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver. But of course his liver would regenerate every day, and so day after day he was punished for eternity by the gods. And liver will regenerate in this very nice way, but actually if we think of other tissues, like cartilage, for example, even the simplest nick and you're going to find it really difficult to regenerate your cartilage. So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.Now, bone is somewhere in between, and this is one of the tissues  that we work on a lot in our lab. And bone is actually quite good at repairing. It has to be. We've probably all had fractures at some point or other. And one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here, called  an iliac crest harvest. And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest, which is just here, and then transplant that  somewhere else in the body. And it actually works really well, because it's your own bone, and it's well vascularized, which means it's got a really good blood supply. But the problem is, there's only so much you can take, and also when you do that operation, your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two  years after the operation.So what we were thinking is, there's a tremendous need  for bone repair, of course, but this iliac crest-type approach really has a lot of limitations to it, and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very, very painful aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest?And so this is what we did, and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently. And we simplified it a lot, so we got rid of a lot of these steps. We got rid of the need to  harvest cells from the patient, we got rid of the need to put  in really fancy chemistries, and we got rid of the need to culture these scaffolds in the lab. And what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple, but because we used it in a really clever way, we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach. So we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone. And it's an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach. And I'll talk you through this.So what we do is, in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones. That layer is called the periosteum. And that layer is actually normally very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone, and it's got stem cells in it. Those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops, and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you with repairing the bone. So we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then, within 30 seconds, would turn into quite a rigid gel and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone. So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells. And we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in, and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells, and they can form lots of new tissue, and then over time, you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body.This is a histology slide of what we see when we do that, and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone. So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg, so the bone marrow, then you can see the original bone, and you can see where that original bone finishes, and just to the left of that is the new bone that's grown within that bioreactor cavity, and you can actually make it even larger. And that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts as a very slight point of weakness, so actually now the surgeon can come along, can harvest away that new bone, and the periosteum can grow back, so you're left with the leg in the same sort of state as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place. So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain compared to an iliac crest harvest. And you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there, so it really is an on demand sort of procedure.Now, at the time that we did this, this received a lot of attention in the press, because it was a really nice way of generating new bone, and we got many, many contacts from different people that  were interested in using this. And I'm just going to tell you, sometimes those contacts are very strange, slightly unexpected, and the very most interesting, let me put it that way, contact that I had, was actually from a team of American footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head.And so you do get these kinds of contacts, and of course, being British and also growing up in France, I tend to be very blunt, and so I had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case, there probably wasn't that much in there to protect in the first place.(Laughter)(Applause)So this was our approach, and it was simple materials, but we thought about it carefully. And actually we know that those cells in the body, in the embryo, as they develop can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage, and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry, put it in there, and we were able to get 100 percent cartilage instead.And this approach works really well, I think, for pre-planned procedures, but it's something you do have to pre-plan. So for other kinds of operations, there's definitely a need for other scaffold-based approaches. And when you think about designing those other scaffolds, actually, you need a really multi-disciplinary team. And so our team has chemists, it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even, and those people all come together and we think really hard about  designing the materials.But we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want, but not be so complex as to make it difficult to get to clinic. And so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body. And so if we think of bone, obviously my own favorite tissue, we zoom in, we can see, even if you don't know anything  about bone structure, it's beautifully organized,  really beautifully organized. We've lots of blood vessels in there. And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot of information to the cells. And if we zoom in again, actually in the case of bone, the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material that's part organic, part inorganic. And that's led to a whole field, really, that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid kind of structure. And so I'm showing here just two examples where we've made some materials that have that sort of structure, and you can really tailor it. You can see here a very squishy one and now a material that's also  this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness, and it's no longer brittle. And an inorganic material  would normally be really brittle, and you wouldn't be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it.One other thing I want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make  are porous, and they have to be, because you want blood vessels to grow in there. But the pores are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells, and so even though it's 3D, the cell might see it more  as a slightly curved surface, and that's a little bit unnatural. And so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds  with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in 3D and give them a little bit more information. And there's a lot of work going  on in both of these areas.Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease, because this is a really big clinical problem. And one of the things that we know is that, unfortunately, if you have a heart attack, then that tissue can start to die, and your outcome may not be very good over time. And it would be really great, actually, if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate. And there's lots and lots of stem  cell trials going on worldwide, and they use many different types of cells, but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually, very often, those cells will die once you've implanted them. And you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system, but either way, we don't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes.And so some of the things that we're thinking of, and many other people in the field are thinking of, are actually developing materials for that. But there's a difference here. We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics, we still need really interesting topography, and we still need really interesting  ways to surround the cells. But now, the cells also would probably quite like a material that's going to be able to be conductive, because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals  between themselves. You can see them now beating synchronously on these materials, and that's a very, very exciting development that's going on.So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that being able to work in this sort of field, all of us that work in this field that's not only super-exciting science, but also has the potential to impact on patients, however big or small they are, is really a great privilege. And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1845, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.119\nAs humans, it's in our nature\n\n00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.413\nto want to improve our health \nand minimize our suffering.\n\n00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:19.080\nWhatever life throws at us,\n\n00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.545\nwhether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,\n\n00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.737\nor even broken bones, we want to try and get better.\n\n00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:27.220\nNow I'm head of a biomaterials lab,\n\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.960\nand I'm really fascinated by the way that humans\n\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.428\nhave used materials in really creative ways\n\n00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:35.172\nin the body over time.\n\n00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:38.818\nTake, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.\n\n00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:40.700\nThis was actually used by the Mayans\n\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.239\nas an artificial tooth replacement.\n\n00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.872\nWe're not quite sure why they did it.\n\n00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:48.448\nIt's hard. It's durable.\n\n00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:52.566\nBut it also had other very nice properties.\n\n00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.846\nIn fact, when they put it into the jawbone,\n\n00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.753\nit could integrate into the jaw,\n\n00:00:57.753 --> 00:00:59.851\nand we know now with very sophisticated\n\n00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.524\nimaging technologies\n\n00:01:01.524 --> 00:01:03.873\nthat part of that integration comes from the fact\n\n00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:05.560\nthat this material is designed\n\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.379\nin a very specific way, has a

00:01:15.366\nof the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans\n\n00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.886\nas the first real application\n\n00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:19.181\nof the bluetooth

different \nmaterials in the body,\n\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.734\nvery often it's been physicians\n\n00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.126\nthat have been quite creative.\n\n00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:33.094\nThey've taken things off the shelf.\n\n00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:34.979\nOne of my favorite examples\n\n00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:38.236\nis that of Sir Harold Ridley,\n\n00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.374\nwho was a famous ophthalmologist,\n\n00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:42.942\nor at least became a famous ophthalmologist.\n\n00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:44.869\nAnd during World War II, what he would see\n\n00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.721\nwould be pilots coming back from their missions,\n\n00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:49.473\nand he noticed that within their eyes\n\n00:01:49.473 --> 00:01:52.413\nthey had shards of small bits of material\n\n00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:53.933\nlodged within the eye,\n\n00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.632\nbut the very interesting thing about it\n\n00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:57.925\nwas that material, actually, wasn't causing\n\n00:01:57.925 --> 00:01:59.938\nany inflammatory response.\n\n00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:02.277\nSo he looked into this, and he figured out\n\n00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:04.881\nthat actually that material was little shards of plastic\n\n00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.620\nthat were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.\n\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.021\nAnd this led him to propose that material\n\n00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:12.783\nas a new material for intraocular lenses.\n\n00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:14.888\nIt's called PMMA, and it's now used\n\n00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:16.690\nin millions of people every year\n\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.459\nand helps in preventing cataracts.\n\n00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.768\nAnd that example, I think, is a really nice one,\n\n00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:24.203\nbecause it helps remind us that in the early days,\n\n00:02:24.203 --> 00:02:26.156\npeople often chose materials\n\n00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:28.041\nbecause they were bioinert.\n\n00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:31.553\nTheir very purpose was to \nperform a mechanical function.\n\n00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:33.003\nYou'd put them in the

medicine,\n\n00:02:38.216 --> 00:02:40.040\nwe've really shifted away from that idea\n\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.953\nof taking a bioinert material.\n\n00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.242\nWe're actually actively looking for materials\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:47.210\nthat will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,\n\n00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.537\nand that furthermore we can put in the body,\n\n00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:50.986\nthey'll have their function,\n\n00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:55.536\nand then they'll dissolve away over time.\n\n00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:57.469\nIf we look at this schematic,\n\n00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.070\nthis is showing you what we think of\n\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.207\nas the typical tissue-engineering approach.\n\n00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:04.051\nWe have cells there, typically from the patient.\n\n00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.933\nWe can put those onto a material,\n\n00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:08.641\nand we can make that material \nvery complex if we want to,\n\n00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.836\nand we can then grow that up in the lab\n\n00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:13.351\nor we can put it straight back into the patient.\n\n00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:15.802\nAnd this is an approach that's \nused all over the world,\n\n00:03:15.802 --> 00:03:19.325\nincluding in our lab.\n\n00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.782\nBut one of the things that's really important\n\n00:03:21.782 --> 00:03:23.660\nwhen we're thinking about stem cells\n\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.239\nis that obviously stem cells \ncan be many different things,\n\n00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.003\nand they want to be many different things,\n\n00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:29.879\nand so we want to make sure that the environment\n\n00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.229\nwe put them into has enough information\n\n00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:34.225\nso that they can become the right sort\n\n00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:36.911\nof specialist tissue.\n\n00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.974\nAnd if we think about the different types of tissues\n\n00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:41.993\nthat people are looking at regenerating\n\n00:03:41.993 --> 00:03:44.304\nall over the world, in all the \ndifferent labs in the world,\n\n00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:47.240\nthere's pretty much every tissue you can think of.\n\n00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.862\nAnd actually, the structure of those tissues\n\n00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:51.476\nis quite different, and it's going to really depend\n\n00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:53.894\non whether your patient has any underlying disease,\n\n00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:56.944\nother conditions, in terms of how\n\n00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:58.505\nyou're going to regenerate your tissue,\n\n00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.490\nand you're going to need to think about the materials\n\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.544\nyou're going to use really carefully,\n\n00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:04.269\ntheir biochemistry, their mechanics,\n\n00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.007\nand many other properties as well.\n\n00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:11.307\nOur tissues all have very \ndifferent abilities to regenerate,\n\n00:04:11.307 --> 00:04:13.049\nand here we see poor Prometheus,\n\n00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.142\nwho made a rather tricky career choice\n\n00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:19.076\nand was punished by the Greek gods.\n\n00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:21.397\nHe was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come\n\n00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:23.000\nevery day to eat his liver.\n\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.267\nBut of course his liver would regenerate every day,\n\n00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:27.539\nand so day after day he was punished\n\n00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.336\nfor eternity by the gods.\n\n00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:37.216\nAnd liver will regenerate in this very nice way,\n\n00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:38.992\nbut actually if we think of other tissues,\n\n00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:40.761\nlike cartilage, for example,\n\n00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:42.817\neven the simplest nick and you're going to find it\n\n00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:45.260\nreally difficult to regenerate your cartilage.\n\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.374\nSo it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.\n\n00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:51.174\nNow, bone is somewhere in between,\n\n00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:54.074\nand this is one of the tissues \nthat we work on a lot in our lab.\n\n00:04:54.074 --> 00:04:56.058\nAnd bone is actually quite good at repairing.\n\n00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:58.071\nIt has to be. We've probably all had fractures\n\n00:04:58.071 --> 00:04:59.883\nat some point or other.\n\n00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.040\nAnd one of the ways that you can think\n\n00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.729\nabout repairing your fracture\n\n00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.556\nis this procedure here, called \nan iliac crest harvest.\n\n00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.222\nAnd what the surgeon might do\n\n00:05:08.222 --> 00:05:11.417\nis take some bone from your iliac crest,\n\n00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:12.795\nwhich is just here,\n\n00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:15.319\nand then transplant that \nsomewhere else in the body.\n\n00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.919\nAnd it actually works really well,\n\n00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.418\nbecause it's your own bone,\n\n00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:19.652\nand it's well vascularized,\n\n00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.021\nwhich means it's got a really good blood supply.\n\n00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.804\nBut the problem is, there's\nonly so much you can take,\n\n00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:27.727\nand also when you do that operation,\n\n00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.266\nyour patients might actually have significant pain\n\n00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:33.507\nin that defect site even two \nyears after the operation.\n\n00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:35.393\nSo what we were thinking is,\n\n00:05:35.393 --> 00:05:38.542\nthere's a tremendous need \nfor bone repair, of course,\n\n00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:41.029\nbut this iliac crest-type approach\n\n00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.461\nreally has a lot of limitations to it,\n\n00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:45.695\nand could we perhaps recreate\n\n00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:47.864\nthe generation of bone within the body\n\n00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:51.179\non demand and then be able to transplant it\n\n00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:56.084\nwithout these very, very painful aftereffects\n\n00:05:56.084 --> 00:05:59.767\nthat you would have with the iliac crest harvest?\n\n00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:02.429\nAnd so this is what we did, and the way we did it\n\n00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.767\nwas by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach\n\n00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:08.154\nbut actually thinking about it rather differently.\n\n00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:10.073\nAnd we simplified it a lot,\n\n00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:12.124\nso we got rid of a lot of these steps.\n\n00:06:12.124 --> 00:06:14.498\nWe got rid of the need to \nharvest cells from the patient,\n\n00:06:14.498 --> 00:06:17.415\nwe got rid of the need to put \nin really fancy chemistries,\n\n00:06:17.415 --> 00:06:19.107\nand we got rid of the need\n\n00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:21.935\nto culture these scaffolds in the lab.\n\n00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:24.114\nAnd what we really focused on\n\n00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:27.863\nwas our material system and making it quite simple,\n\n00:06:27.863 --> 00:06:30.188\nbut because we used it in a really clever way,\n\n00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:32.835\nwe were able to generate enormous amounts of bone\n\n00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:34.481\nusing this approach.\n\n00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:36.234\nSo we were using the body\n\n00:06:36.234 --> 00:06:38.354\nas really the catalyst to help us\n\n00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:40.897\nto make lots of new bone.\n\n00:06:40.897 --> 00:06:42.480\nAnd it's an approach that we call\n\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.291\nthe in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make\n\n00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.777\nenormous amounts of bone using this approach.\n\n00:06:47.777 --> 00:06:49.016\nAnd I'll talk you through this.\n\n00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:51.496\nSo what we do is,\n\n00:06:51.496 --> 00:06:53.839\nin humans, we all have a layer of stem cells\n\n00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.727\non the outside of our long bones.\n\n00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:57.430\nThat layer is called the periosteum.\n\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.718\nAnd that layer is actually normally\n\n00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:02.367\nvery, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,\n\n00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:03.799\nand it's got stem cells in it.\n\n00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.218\nThose stem cells are really important\n\n00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:07.027\nin the embryo when it develops,\n\n00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:09.269\nand they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture\n\n00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:12.130\nto help you with repairing the bone.\n\n00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.223\nSo we take that periosteum layer\n\n00:07:14.223 --> 00:07:17.213\nand we developed a way to inject underneath it\n\n00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:20.029\na liquid that then, within 30 seconds,\n\n00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:21.774\nwould turn into quite a rigid gel\n\n00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:25.027\nand can actually lift the\nperiosteum away from the bone.\n\n00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:28.715\nSo it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity\n\n00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:32.262\nthat is right next to both the bone\n\n00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:35.963\nbut also this really rich layer of stem cells.\n\n00:07:35.963 --> 00:07:37.575\nAnd we go in through a pinhole incision\n\n00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:40.528\nso that no other cells from the body can get in,\n\n00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:45.320\nand what happens is that that\nartificial in vivo bioreactor cavity\n\n00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.996\ncan then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,\n\n00:07:47.996 --> 00:07:50.082\nand they can form lots of new tissue,\n\n00:07:50.082 --> 00:07:52.400\nand then over time, you can harvest that tissue\n\n00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.348\nand use it elsewhere in the body.\n\n00:07:55.348 --> 00:07:57.492\nThis is a histology slide\n\n00:07:57.492 --> 00:07:59.662\nof what we see when we do that,\n\n00:07:59.662 --> 00:08:02.179\nand essentially what we see\n\n00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:03.813\nis very large amounts of bone.\n\n00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:06.293\nSo in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,\n\n00:08:06.293 --> 00:08:07.794\nso the bone marrow,\n\n00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:09.598\nthen you can see the original bone,\n\n00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:12.454\nand you can see where that original bone finishes,\n\n00:08:12.454 --> 00:08:14.965\nand just to the left of that is the new bone\n\n00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:17.002\nthat's grown within that bioreactor cavity,\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:19.433\nand you can actually make it even larger.\n\n00:08:19.433 --> 00:08:22.060\nAnd that demarcation that you can see\n\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.411\nbetween the original bone and the new bone\n\n00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:26.424\nacts as a very slight point of weakness,\n\n00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:28.558\nso actually now the surgeon can come along,\n\n00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:30.582\ncan harvest away that new bone,\n\n00:08:30.582 --> 00:08:32.785\nand the periosteum can grow back,\n\n00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:34.654\nso you're left with the leg\n\n00:08:34.654 --> 00:08:36.204\nin the same sort of state\n\n00:08:36.204 --> 00:08:38.206\nas if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.\n\n\n00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:42.055\nSo it's very, very low in terms of after-pain\n\n00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:45.910\ncompared to an iliac crest harvest.\n\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.014\nAnd you can grow different amounts of bone\n\n00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:50.033\ndepending on how much gel you put in there,\n\n00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:53.235\nso it really is an on demand sort of procedure.\n\n00:08:53.235 --> 00:08:55.437\nNow, at the time that we did this,\n\n00:08:55.437 --> 00:08:58.774\nthis received a lot of attention in the press,\n\n00:08:58.774 --> 00:09:01.205\nbecause it was a really nice way\n\n00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:02.671\nof generating new bone,\n\n00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.666\nand we got many, many contacts\n\n00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:07.284\nfrom different people that \nwere interested in using this.\n\n00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:09.073\nAnd I'm just going to tell you,\n\n00:09:09.073 --> 00:09:12.026\nsometimes those contacts are very strange,\n\n00:09:12.026 --> 00:09:13.886\nslightly unexpected,\n\n00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:16.948\nand the very most interesting,\n\n00:09:16.948 --> 00:09:19.233\nlet me put it that way, contact that I had,\n\n00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:22.444\nwas actually from a team of American footballers\n\n00:09:22.444 --> 00:09:25.824\nthat all wanted to have double-thickness skulls\n\n00:09:25.824 --> 00:09:30.105\nmade on their head.\n\n00:09:30.114 --> 00:09:32.838\nAnd so you do get these kinds of contacts,\n\n00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.455\nand of course, being British\n\n00:09:35.455 --> 00:09:37.209\nand also growing up in France,\n\n00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.351\nI tend to be very blunt,\n\n00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:41.392\nand so I had to explain to them very nicely\n\n00:09:41.392 --> 00:09:42.867\nthat in their particular case,\n\n00:09:42.867 --> 00:09:44.881\nthere probably wasn't that much in there\n\n00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:47.869\nto protect in the first place.\n\n00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:49.439\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:50.692\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:50.692 --> 00:09:52.547\nSo this was our approach,\n\n00:09:52.547 --> 00:09:54.191\nand it was simple materials,\n\n00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:56.178\nbut we thought about it carefully.\n\n00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:57.798\nAnd actually we know that those cells\n\n00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.936\nin the body, in the embryo, as they develop\n\n00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:03.165\ncan form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,\n\n00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:05.720\nand so we developed a gel that was slightly different\n\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.139\nin nature and slightly different chemistry,\n\n00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:10.286\nput it in there, and we were able to get\n\n00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:12.464\n100 percent cartilage instead.\n\n00:10:12.464 --> 00:10:14.472\nAnd this approach works really well, I think,\n\n00:10:14.472 --> 00:10:16.954\nfor pre-planned procedures,\n\n00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:19.826\nbut it's something you do have to pre-plan.\n\n00:10:19.826 --> 00:10:22.094\nSo for other kinds of operations,\n\n00:10:22.094 --> 00:10:23.791\nthere's definitely a need for other\n\n00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.294\nscaffold-based approaches.\n\n00:10:26.294 --> 00:10:28.663\nAnd when you think about designing\n\n00:10:28.663 --> 00:10:30.301\nthose other scaffolds, actually,\n\n00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:32.272\nyou need a really multi-disciplinary team.\n\n00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:34.337\nAnd so our team has chemists,\n\n00:10:34.337 --> 00:10:37.714\nit has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,\n\n00:10:37.714 --> 00:10:39.744\nand those people all come together\n\n00:10:39.744 --> 00:10:42.155\nand we think really hard about \ndesigning the materials.\n\n00:10:42.155 --> 00:10:45.121\nBut we want to make them have enough information\n\n00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:47.275\nthat we can get the cells to do what we want,\n\n00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:49.652\nbut not be so complex as to make it difficult\n\n00:10:49.652 --> 00:10:51.395\nto get to clinic.\n\n00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:54.146\nAnd so one of the things we think about a lot\n\n00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:55.941\nis really trying to understand\n\n00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:58.318\nthe structure of the tissues in the body.\n\n00:10:58.318 --> 00:10:59.978\nAnd so if we think of bone,\n\n00:10:59.978 --> 00:11:02.602\nobviously my own favorite tissue,\n\n00:11:02.602 --> 00:11:04.159\nwe zoom in, we can see,\n\n00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:06.041\neven if you don't know anything \nabout bone structure,\n\n00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:08.586\nit's beautifully organized, \nreally beautifully organized.\n\n00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:10.473\nWe've lots of blood vessels in there.\n\n00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:12.812\nAnd if we zoom in again, we see that the cells\n\n00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:15.784\nare actually surrounded by a 3D matrix\n\n00:11:15.784 --> 00:11:17.955\nof nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot\n\n00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:20.137\nof information to the cells.\n\n00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:21.751\nAnd if we zoom in again,\n\n00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:23.952\nactually in the case of bone, the matrix\n\n00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:26.103\naround the cells is beautifully organized\n\n00:11:26.103 --> 00:11:28.570\nat the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material\n\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.154\nthat's part organic, part inorganic.\n\n00:11:31.154 --> 00:11:33.226\nAnd that's led to a whole field, really,\n\n00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:35.617\nthat has looked at developing materials\n\n00:11:35.617 --> 00:11:38.365\nthat have this hybrid kind of structure.\n\n00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:41.643\nAnd so I'm showing here just two examples\n\n00:11:41.643 --> 00:11:44.763\nwhere we've made some materials\nthat have that sort of structure,\n\n00:11:44.763 --> 00:11:46.201\nand you can really tailor it.\n\n00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:48.265\nYou can see here a very squishy one\n\n00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:52.364\nand now a material that's also \nthis hybrid sort of material\n\n00:11:52.364 --> 00:11:54.311\nbut actually has remarkable toughness,\n\n00:11:54.327 --> 00:11:55.787\nand it's no longer brittle.\n\n00:11:55.787 --> 00:11:58.243\nAnd an inorganic material \nwould normally be really brittle,\n\n00:11:58.243 --> 00:11:59.683\nand you wouldn't be able to have\n\n00:11:59.683 --> 00:12:01.871\nthat sort of strength and toughness in it.\n\n00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.360\nOne other thing I want to quickly mention is that\n\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.075\nmany of the scaffolds we make \nare porous, and they have to be,\n\n00:12:07.075 --> 00:12:09.178\nbecause you want blood vessels to grow in there.\n\n00:12:09.178 --> 00:12:11.055\nBut the pores are actually oftentimes\n\n00:12:11.055 --> 00:12:12.348\nmuch bigger than the cells,\n\n00:12:12.348 --> 00:12:14.059\nand so even though it's 3D,\n\n00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:17.414\nthe cell might see it more \nas a slightly curved surface,\n\n00:12:17.414 --> 00:12:19.090\nand that's a little bit unnatural.\n\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.338\nAnd so one of the things you can think about doing\n\n00:12:21.338 --> 00:12:24.486\nis actually making scaffolds \nwith slightly different dimensions\n\n00:12:24.486 --> 00:12:27.279\nthat might be able to surround your cells in 3D\n\n00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.848\nand give them a little bit more information.\n\n00:12:29.848 --> 00:12:33.415\nAnd there's a lot of work going \non in both of these areas.\n\n00:12:33.429 --> 00:12:37.398\nNow finally, I just want to talk a little bit about\n\n00:12:37.398 --> 00:12:40.106\napplying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,\n\n00:12:40.106 --> 00:12:43.369\nbecause this is a really big clinical problem.\n\n00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:46.954\nAnd one of the things that we know is that,\n\n00:12:46.954 --> 00:12:49.193\nunfortunately, if you have a heart attack,\n\n00:12:49.193 --> 00:12:52.095\nthen that tissue can start to die,\n\n00:12:52.095 --> 00:12:55.846\nand your outcome may not be very good over time.\n\n00:12:55.846 --> 00:12:57.556\nAnd it would be really great, actually,\n\n00:12:57.556 --> 00:12:59.475\nif we could stop that dead tissue\n\n00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:03.460\neither from dying or help it to regenerate.\n\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.708\nAnd there's lots and lots of stem \ncell trials going on worldwide,\n\n00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:08.780\nand they use many different types of cells,\n\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.132\nbut one common theme that seems to be coming out\n\n00:13:11.132 --> 00:13:14.131\nis that actually, very often, those cells will die\n\n00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:15.926\nonce you've implanted them.\n\n00:13:15.926 --> 00:13:17.801\nAnd you can either put them into the heart\n\n00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:19.821\nor into the blood system,\n\n00:13:19.821 --> 00:13:22.183\nbut either way, we don't seem to be able\n\n00:13:22.183 --> 00:13:24.050\nto get quite the right number of cells\n\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.292\ngetting to the location we want them to\n\n00:13:26.292 --> 00:13:30.786\nand being able to deliver the sort of beautiful\n\n00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:33.526\ncell regeneration that we would like to have\n\n00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:36.943\nto get good clinical outcomes.\n\n00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:38.926\nAnd so some of the things that we're thinking of,\n\n00:13:38.926 --> 00:13:42.047\nand many other people in the field are thinking of,\n\n00:13:42.047 --> 00:13:45.053\nare actually developing materials for that.\n\n00:13:45.053 --> 00:13:46.672\nBut there's a difference here.\n\n00:13:46.672 --> 00:13:48.882\nWe still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,\n\n00:13:48.882 --> 00:13:51.553\nwe still need really interesting topography,\n\n00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:54.201\nand we still need really interesting \nways to surround the cells.\n\n00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:56.712\nBut now, the cells also\n\n00:13:56.712 --> 00:13:58.737\nwould probably quite like a material\n\n00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.755\nthat's going to be able to be conductive,\n\n00:14:00.755 --> 00:14:04.964\nbecause the cells themselves will respond very well\n\n00:14:04.964 --> 00:14:08.443\nand will actually conduct signals \nbetween themselves.\n\n00:14:08.443 --> 00:14:09.959\nYou can see them now\n\n00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:12.434\nbeating synchronously on these materials,\n\n00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:15.213\nand that's a very, very exciting development\n\n00:14:15.213 --> 00:14:17.327\nthat's going on.\n\n00:14:17.327 --> 00:14:22.151\nSo just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that\n\n00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:24.507\nbeing able to work in this sort of field,\n\n00:14:24.507 --> 00:14:26.161\nall of us that work in this field\n\n00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:28.670\nthat's not only super-exciting science,\n\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.716\nbut also has the potential\n\n00:14:30.716 --> 00:14:32.684\nto impact on patients,\n\n00:14:32.684 --> 00:14:35.114\nhowever big or small they are,\n\n00:14:35.114 --> 00:14:36.667\nis really a great privilege.\n\n00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.811\nAnd so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.\n\n00:14:39.811 --> 00:14:41.128\nThank you.\n\n00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:46.052\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What it takes to be a great leader", "duration": "559", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/roselinde_torres_what_it_takes_to_be_a_great_leader", "transcript": "What makes a great leader today? Many of us carry this image of this all-knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers. But that's kind of an image from another time, and what's also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was, not a world that is or that is coming.We conducted a study of 4,000 companies, and we asked them, let's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs. Fifty-eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles. That means that despite corporate training programs, off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things, more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders. You may be asking yourself, is my company helping me to prepare to be a great 21st-century leader? The odds are, probably not.Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional life observing what makes great leaders. I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies, I've advised over 200 CEOs, and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine. But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation. I noticed that, despite all the efforts, there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals. One story was about Chris, a high-potential, superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails, destroying unrecoverable value. And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO, who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders, but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped to lead their crucial initiatives. And then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once-thriving business that's surprised by a market shift, finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business.Now, these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions. Why are the leadership gaps widening when there's so much more investment in leadership development? And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow? One of the things that I did, I was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories, that I left my job so that I could study this full time, and I took a year to travel to different parts of the world to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies, countries and nonprofit organizations. And so I did things like travel to South Africa, where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political, social and economic context. I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who, despite very limited financial resources, were making a huge impact in the world, often bringing together seeming adversaries. And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders, the moves that they made, and then the impact of those moves beyond their tenure. And then, when I returned to work full time, in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions.Now, from all this, I distilled the characteristics of leaders who are thriving and what they do differently, and then I also distilled the preparation practices that enable people to grow to their potential. I want to share some of those with you now.(\"What makes a great leader in the 21st century?\")In a 21st-century world, which is more global, digitally enabled and transparent, with faster speeds of information  flow and innovation, and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix, relying on traditional development practices will stunt your growth as a leader. In fact, traditional assessments like narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives, lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are. Leadership in the 21st century is defined and evidenced by three questions.Where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your business model or your life? The answer to this question is on your calendar. Who are you spending time with? On what topics? Where are you traveling? What are you reading? And then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities, and then making a decision to do something right now so that you're prepared and ready? There's a leadership team that does a practice where they bring together each member collecting, here are trends that impact me, here are trends that impact another team member, and they share these, and then make decisions, to course-correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move. Great leaders are not head-down. They see around corners, shaping their future, not just reacting to it.The second question is, what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network? You know, we hear often about  good ol' boy networks and they're certainly alive and  well in many institutions. But to some extent, we all have a network of people that we're comfortable with. So this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you. And those differences can be biological, physical, functional, political,  cultural, socioeconomic. And yet, despite all these differences, they connect with you and they trust you enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal. Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions, because you have people that are thinking differently than you are.Third question: are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has  made you successful in the past? There's an expression: Go along to get along. But if you follow this advice, chances are as a leader, you're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable. Great leaders dare to be different. They don't just talk about risk-taking, they actually do it. And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is na\u00efve or reckless or just plain stupid. Now interestingly, the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network. They're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap. And it's a leap, not a step. More than traditional leadership programs, answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21st-century leader.So what makes a great leader in the 21st century? I've met many, and they stand out. They are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1930, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:17.189\nWhat makes a great leader today?\n\n00:00:17.189 -->

00:05:57.732\nand then making a decision to do something\n\n00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:02.146\nright now so that you're prepared and ready?\n\n00:06:02.146 --> 00:06:05.148\nThere's a leadership team that does a practice\n\n00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:08.120\nwhere they bring together each member\n\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.927\ncollecting, here are trends that impact me,\n\n00:06:10.927 --> 00:06:13.212\nhere are trends that impact another team member,\n\n00:06:13.212 --> 00:06:14.611\nand they share these,\n\n00:06:14.611 --> 00:06:17.407\nand then make decisions,\nto course-correct a strategy\n\n00:06:17.407 --> 00:06:20.664\nor to anticipate a new move.\n\n00:06:20.664 --> 00:06:23.717\nGreat leaders are not head-down.\n\n00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.962\nThey see around corners,\n\n00:06:25.962 --> 00:06:29.871\nshaping their future, not just reacting to it.\n\n00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:31.826\nThe second question is,\n\n00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:33.845\nwhat is the diversity measure\n\n00:06:33.845 --> 00:06:37.464\nof your personal and professional\nstakeholder network?\n\n00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:40.466\nYou know, we hear often about \ngood ol' boy networks\n\n00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:44.374\nand they're certainly alive and \nwell in many institutions.\n\n00:06:44.382 --> 00:06:46.925\nBut to some extent, we all have a network\n\n00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:48.854\nof people that we're comfortable with.\n\n00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:51.766\nSo this question is about your capacity\n\n00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:54.265\nto develop relationships with people\n\n00:06:54.265 --> 00:06:55.788\nthat are very different than you.\n\n00:06:55.788 --> 00:06:58.781\nAnd those differences can be biological,\n\n00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:03.565\nphysical, functional, political, \ncultural, socioeconomic.\n\n00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:07.008\nAnd yet, despite all these differences,\n\n00:07:07.008 --> 00:07:08.765\nthey connect with you\n\n00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:10.019\nand they trust you enough\n\n00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:11.301\nto cooperate with you\n\n00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:14.439\nin achieving a shared goal.\n\n00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.774\nGreat leaders understand\n\n00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:19.703\nthat having a more diverse network\n\n00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:23.244\nis a source of pattern identification\n\n00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:26.029\nat greater levels and also of solutions,\n\n00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.853\nbecause you have people that are thinking\n\n00:07:27.853 --> 00:07:30.538\ndifferently than you are.\n\n00:07:30.538 --> 00:07:33.888\nThird question: are you courageous enough\n\n00:07:33.888 --> 00:07:39.790\nto abandon a practice that has \nmade you successful in the past?\n\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.939\nThere's an expression: Go along to get along.\n\n00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:46.857\nBut if you follow this advice,\n\n00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:49.249\nchances are as a leader,\n\n00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:53.764\nyou're going to keep doing\nwhat's familiar and comfortable.\n\n00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:56.617\nGreat leaders dare to be different.\n\n00:07:56.617 --> 00:07:58.262\nThey don't just talk about risk-taking,\n\n00:07:58.262 --> 00:08:00.080\nthey actually do it.\n\n00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.992\nAnd one of the leaders shared with me the fact that\n\n00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:05.569\nthe most impactful development comes\n\n00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:08.873\nwhen you are able to build the emotional stamina\n\n00:08:08.873 --> 00:08:13.033\nto withstand people telling you that your new idea\n\n00:08:13.033 --> 00:08:17.751\nis na\u00efve or reckless or just plain stupid.\n\n00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:21.613\nNow interestingly, the people who will join you\n\n00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:25.068\nare not your usual suspects in your network.\n\n00:08:25.068 --> 00:08:28.719\nThey're often people that think differently\n\n00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:31.591\nand therefore are willing to join you\n\n00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:33.950\nin taking a courageous leap.\n\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.201\nAnd it's a leap, not a step.\n\n00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:40.110\nMore than traditional leadership programs,\n\n00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.992\nanswering these three questions\n\n00:08:41.992 --> 00:08:43.375\nwill determine your effectiveness\n\n00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:46.844\nas a 21st-century leader.\n\n00:08:46.844 --> 00:08:51.265\nSo what makes a great leader in the 21st century?\n\n00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:54.814\nI've met many, and they stand out.\n\n00:08:54.814 --> 00:08:56.465\nThey are women and men\n\n00:08:56.465 --> 00:08:58.231\nwho are preparing themselves\n\n00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:01.350\nnot for the comfortable predictability of yesterday\n\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.126\nbut also for the realities of today\n\n00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:09.387\nand all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.\n\n00:09:09.387 --> 00:09:11.814\nThank you.\n\n00:09:11.814 --> 00:09:14.492\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Are we designed to be sexual omnivores?", "duration": "842", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_ryan_are_we_designed_to_be_sexual_omnivores", "transcript": "I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation. All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right.So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex. Could be the neighbors, hotel room, your parents. Sorry. Okay. Pretty much everybody. Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman. I see one guy there. It doesn't count if it was you, sir. (Laughter) So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. Sitting next to a loud guy.Now what does this tell us? It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex, and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd. I wasn't even going to mention this, but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here, and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer. So I thought, got to talk about that. We'll get back to that a little bit later.Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes, despite what you may have heard. We are apes. We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant, as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books. We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate \u2014 gorillas, orangutans, what have you. So we're extremely closely related to them, and as you'll see in terms of our behavior, we've got some relationship as well. So what I'm asking today, the question I want to explore with you today is, what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality? Now, since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution, and you're all familiar with it, even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that, as part of human nature, from the beginning of our species' time, men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status, protection, things like that. And in exchange, women have offered fidelity, or at least a promise of fidelity. Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship. The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA, according to this vision. Right? What Cacilda and I have argued is that no, this economic relationship, this oppositional relationship, is actually an artifact of agriculture, which only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest. Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200,000 years, so we're talking about five percent, at most, of our time as a modern, distinct species. So before agriculture, before the agricultural revolution, it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. They not only share things, they demand that things be shared: meat, shelter, protection, all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity, it turns out, are shared widely among these societies. Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages, and I'm not saying modern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either. What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context. And there's really no argument about this among anthropologists. All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality. So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved, until agriculture, as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex, flexible social systems, networks, that our ancestors were very good at, and that's why our species has survived so well.Now, this makes some people uncomfortable, and so I always need to take  a moment in these talks to say, listen, I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous, but I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. There were no strangers. Right? In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying, yes, there were overlapping sexual relationships, that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with. And I'm not saying there was no pair-bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive.And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous \u2014 my parents, for example, have been married for 52 years monogamously, and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad, I don't want to hear about it\u2014 I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian, but don't think that just because you've made that decision, bacon suddenly stops smelling good. Okay? So this is my point. (Laughter) That one took a minute to sink in, huh?Now, in addition to being a great genius, a wonderful man, a wonderful husband, a wonderful father, Charles Darwin was also a world-class Victorian prude. All right? He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates, including chimps and bonobos, because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. So he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond, right? Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this, but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent, roughly, of their menstrual cycle, bonobos 90 percent, and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle, whether she's menstruating, whether she's post-menopausal, whether she's already pregnant. This is vanishingly rare among mammals. So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality. Now, Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day, as scientists tend to do sometimes.So what we're talking about is sperm competition. Now the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells, so it's already a competitive environment. The question is whether these sperm are  competing against other men's sperm or just their own. There's a lot to talk about in this chart. The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human. That indicates female copulatory vocalization. Just look at the numbers. The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth. If that number seems high for some of you, I assure you it seems low for others in the room. We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos. We don't share it with the other three apes, the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon, who are more typical of mammals, having sex only about a dozen times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only  animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive. (Laughter) And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo all have external testicles, which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage, you expect a party to happen at any moment, and you need to be ready. That's what the external testicles are. They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations. I'm sorry. It's true. The human, some of you will be happy to hear, has the largest, thickest penis of any primate.Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy. It goes into anthropology as well. Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution. These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China. In their society, everyone, men and women, are completely sexually autonomous. There's no shame associated with sexual behavior. Women have hundreds of partners. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue. When the woman becomes pregnant, the child is cared for by her,  her sisters, and her brothers. The biological father is a nonissue. On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon, we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. These people actually believe \u2014 and they have no contact among them, no common language or anything, so it's not an idea that spread, it's an idea that's arisen around the world \u2014 they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen. So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy, the funny guy and the strong guy, to get the essence of each of these men into the baby, and then when the child is born, these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child. So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society. So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book.Now, why does this matter? Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. I think that's true. This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering. My hope is that a more accurate, updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves, for each other, greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions, and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate, instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior. (Applause) Thank you. And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet. We all have closets we have to come out of. Right? And when we do come out of those closets, we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other, our fight is with an outdated,  Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights, generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy. It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus, because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Thank you. Christopher Ryan: Thank you.CA: So a question. It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. Someone could give a talk and say, look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons, and if you look at lots of societies around the world, you'll see very high rates of violence. Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism, but it's not who you are. How is that different from the talk you gave?CR: Well first of all, the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. But that's just an example. Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me, just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that  way now, and I agree with that. Everyone has to respond to the modern world. But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. And so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes, but your body will rebel against  that. We have appetites. I think it was Schopenhauer who said, a person can do what they want but not want what they want. And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires. It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people, there's something wrong with you, there's something wrong with your marriage, something wrong with your partner. I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality. That's what I'm trying to get at.CA: Thank you. Communicated powerfully. Thanks a lot.CR: Thank you, Chris.

We are apes.\n\n00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.295\nWe are more closely related\nto the chimp and the bonobo\n\n00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:28.675\nthan the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,\n\n00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:31.873\nas Jared Diamond pointed\nout in one of his early books.\n\n00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:36.068\nWe're more closely related to chimps and bonobos\n\n00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:37.569\nthan chimps and bonobos are related\n\n00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.231\nto any other primate --\n\n00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.507\ngorillas, orangutans, what have you.\n\n00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:44.754\nSo we're extremely closely related to them,\n\n00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.180\nand as you'll see in terms of our behavior,\n\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.547\nwe've got some relationship as well.\n\n00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:51.466\nSo what I'm asking today, the question\n\n00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:54.528\nI want to explore with you today is,\n\n00:01:54.528 --> 00:01:58.696\nwhat kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?\n\n00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:00.914\nNow, since Darwin's day there's been\n\n00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:02.416\nwhat Cacilda and I have called\n\n00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.102\nthe standard narrative of human sexual evolution,\n\n00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:06.656\nand you're all familiar with it,\n\n00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:09.219\neven if you haven't read this stuff.\n\n00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.287\nThe idea is that, as part of human nature,\n\n00:02:12.287 --> 00:02:14.276\nfrom the beginning of our species' time,\n\n00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:18.770\nmen have sort of leased\nwomen's reproductive potential\n\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.165\nby providing them with certain goods and services.\n\n00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:25.835\nGenerally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,\n\n00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.466\nprotection, things like that.\n\n00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.801\nAnd in exchange, women have offered fidelity,\n\n00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.179\nor at least a promise of fidelity.\n\n00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:37.449\nNow this sets men and women up\nin an oppositional relationship.\n\n00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:43.392\nThe war between the sexes is built right into\nour DNA, according to this vision. Right?\n\n00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:47.329\nWhat Cacilda and I have argued is that no,\n\n00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.770\nthis economic relationship,\n\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.595\nthis oppositional relationship,\n\n00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:54.220\nis actually an artifact of agriculture,\n\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.896\nwhich only arose about 10,000\nyears ago at the earliest.\n\n00:02:57.896 --> 00:03:00.063\nAnatomically modern human beings\n\n00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:03.062\nhave been around for about 200,000 years,\n\n00:03:03.062 --> 00:03:06.684\nso we're talking about five percent, at most,\n\n00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:10.372\nof our time as a modern, distinct species.\n\n00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:13.906\nSo before agriculture,\n\n00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:15.911\nbefore the agricultural revolution,\n\n00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.022\nit's important to understand that human beings\n\n00:03:18.022 --> 00:03:21.356\nlived in hunter-gatherer groups that are\n\n00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:24.372\ncharacterized wherever they're found in the world\n\n00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:28.963\nby what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.\n\n00:03:28.963 --> 00:03:30.831\nThey not only share things,\n\n00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:33.340\nthey demand that things be shared:\n\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.599\nmeat, shelter, protection, all these things\n\n00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.608\nthat were supposedly being traded to women\n\n00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:41.438\nfor their sexual fidelity, it turns out,\n\n00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:44.168\nare shared widely among these societies.\n\n00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:46.356\nNow I'm not saying that our ancestors\n\n00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:48.317\nwere noble savages, and I'm not saying\n\n00:03:48.317 --> 00:03:51.113\nmodern day hunter-gatherers\nare noble savages either.\n\n00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:53.124\nWhat I'm saying is that this is simply\n\n00:03:53.124 --> 00:03:55.564\nthe best way to mitigate risk\n\n00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:57.494\nin a foraging context.\n\n00:03:57.494 --> 00:04:00.610\nAnd there's really no argument\nabout this among anthropologists.\n\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.174\nAll Cacilda and I have done is extend\nthis sharing behavior to sexuality.\n\n00:04:05.174 --> 00:04:07.609\nSo we've argued that human sexuality\n\n00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.093\nhas essentially evolved, until agriculture,\n\n00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:15.239\nas a way of establishing and maintaining\n\n00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.965\nthe complex, flexible social systems, networks,\n\n00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:21.876\nthat our ancestors were very good at,\n\n00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:26.492\nand that's why our species has survived so well.\n\n00:04:26.492 --> 00:04:28.709\nNow, this makes some people uncomfortable,\n\n00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:31.094\nand so I always need to take \na moment in these talks\n\n00:04:31.094 --> 00:04:32.938\nto say, listen,\n\n00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:35.581\nI'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,\n\n00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:37.916\nbut I'm not saying they were\nhaving sex with strangers.\n\n00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.942\nThere were no strangers.

It's not an issue.\n\n00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.191\nWhen the woman becomes pregnant,\n\n00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:26.049\nthe child is cared for by her, \nher sisters, and her brothers.\n\n00:09:26.049 --> 00:09:28.888\nThe biological father is a nonissue.\n\n00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:31.294\nOn the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,\n\n00:09:31.294 --> 00:09:34.163\nwe've got many tribes which practice\n\n00:09:34.163 --> 00:09:36.895\nwhat anthropologists call partible paternity.\n\n00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:39.492\nThese people actually believe --\n\n00:09:39.492 --> 00:09:41.207\nand they have no contact among them,\n\n00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:42.863\nno common language or anything,\n\n00:09:42.863 --> 00:09:44.600\nso it's not an idea that spread,\n\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.737\nit's an idea that's arisen around the world --\n\n00:09:46.737 --> 00:09:48.894\nthey believe that a fetus is literally made\n\n00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:51.170\nof accumulated semen.\n\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.158\nSo a woman who wants to have a child\n\n00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:54.990\nwho's smart and funny and strong\n\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.121\nmakes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,\n\n00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:59.065\nthe funny guy and the strong guy,\n\n00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.289\nto get the essence of each of\nthese men into the baby,\n\n00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:03.801\nand then when the child is born,\n\n00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:05.943\nthese different men will come forward\n\n00:10:05.943 --> 00:10:08.813\nand acknowledge their paternity of the child.\n\n00:10:08.813 --> 00:10:11.651\nSo paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor\n\n00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:13.267\nin this society.\n\n00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:15.255\nSo there are all sorts of examples like this\n\n00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:17.705\nthat we go through in the book.\n\n00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:21.165\nNow, why does this matter?\n\n00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:23.725\nEdward Wilson says we need to understand\n\n00:10:23.725 --> 00:10:26.771\nthat human sexuality is first a bonding device\n\n00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:29.606\nand only secondarily procreation.\n\n00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:31.790\nI think that's true. This matters because\n\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.828\nour evolved sexuality is in direct conflict\n\n00:10:34.828 --> 00:10:37.415\nwith many aspects of the modern world.\n\n00:10:37.415 --> 00:10:39.553\nThe contradictions between what we're told\n\n00:10:39.553 --> 00:10:42.980\nwe should feel and what we actually do feel\n\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.117\ngenerates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.\n\n00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:50.533\nMy hope is that a more accurate,\n\n00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:52.908\nupdated understanding of human sexuality\n\n00:10:52.908 --> 00:10:55.928\nwill lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,\n\n00:10:55.928 --> 00:10:57.525\nfor each other,\n\n00:10:57.525 --> 00:11:01.148\ngreater respect for unconventional\nrelationship configurations\n\n00:11:01.148 --> 00:11:06.429\nlike same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,\n\n00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:09.777\nand that we'll finally put to rest the idea\n\n00:11:09.777 --> 00:11:12.351\nthat men have some innate, instinctive right\n\n00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:16.579\nto monitor and control women's sexual behavior.\n\n00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:19.571\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:21.725\nThank you.\n\n00:11:21.725 --> 00:11:23.981\nAnd we'll see that it's not only gay people\n\n00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:25.650\nthat have to come out of the closet.\n\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.179\nWe all have closets we have to come out of. Right?\n\n00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:30.940\nAnd when we do come out of those closets,\n\n00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.499\nwe'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,\n\n00:11:34.499 --> 00:11:39.003\nour fight is with an outdated, \nVictorian sense of human sexuality\n\n00:11:39.003 --> 00:11:42.558\nthat conflates desire with property rights,\n\n00:11:42.558 --> 00:11:45.323\ngenerates shame and confusion\n\n00:11:45.323 --> 00:11:48.158\nin place of understanding and empathy.\n\n00:11:48.158 --> 00:11:50.874\nIt's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,\n\n00:11:50.874 --> 00:11:52.604\nbecause the truth is\n\n00:11:52.604 --> 00:11:53.941\nthat men are from Africa\n\n00:11:53.941 --> 00:11:55.937\nand women are from Africa.\n\n00:11:55.937 --> 00:11:57.882\nThank you.\n\n00:11:57.882 --> 00:12:03.341\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:06.488 --> 00:12:08.982\nChris Anderson: Thank you.\nChristopher Ryan: Thank you.\n\n00:12:08.982 --> 00:12:10.724\nCA: So a question.\n\n00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:14.623\nIt's so perplexing, trying to use arguments\n\n00:12:14.623 --> 00:12:17.690\nabout evolutionary history\n\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.274\nto turn that into what we ought to do today.\n\n00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:22.680\nSomeone could give a talk and say,\n\n00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.425\nlook at us, we've got these really sharp teeth\n\n00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:27.152\nand muscles and a brain that's really good\n\n00:12:27.152 --> 00:12:28.713\nat throwing weapons,\n\n00:12:28.713 --> 00:12:31.777\nand if you look at lots of societies around the world,\n\n00:12:31.777 --> 00:12:34.063\nyou'll see very high rates of violence.\n\n00:12:34.063 --> 00:12:37.232\nNonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,\n\n00:12:37.232 --> 00:12:39.376\nbut it's not who you are.\n\n00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:41.426\nHow is that different\n\n00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:44.791\nfrom the talk you gave?\n\n00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:47.975\nCR: Well first of all, the evidence\n\n00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:50.750\nfor high levels of violence in prehistory\n\n00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.356\nis very debatable.\n\n00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.557\nBut that's just an example.\n\n00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:59.161\nCertainly, you know, lots of people say to me,\n\n00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:01.701\njust because we lived a certain way in the past\n\n00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:04.900\ndoesn't mean we should live that \nway now, and I agree with that.\n\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.427\nEveryone has to respond to the modern world.\n\n00:13:07.427 --> 00:13:11.849\nBut the body does have its inherent\n\n00:13:11.849 --> 00:13:14.706\nevolved trajectories.\n\n00:13:14.706 --> 00:13:18.186\nAnd so you could live on\nMcDonald's and milkshakes,\n\n00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:21.642\nbut your body will rebel against \nthat. We have appetites.\n\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.348\nI think it was Schopenhauer who said,\n\n00:13:23.348 --> 00:13:26.212\na person can do what they want\n\n00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:28.269\nbut not want what they want.\n\n00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:29.992\nAnd so what I'm arguing against\n\n00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:32.456\nis the shame that's associated with desires.\n\n00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:35.815\nIt's the idea that if you love your husband or wife\n\n00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.025\nbut you still are attracted to other people,\n\n00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.524\nthere's something wrong with you,\n\n00:13:39.524 --> 00:13:41.461\nthere's something wrong with your marriage,\n\n00:13:41.461 --> 00:13:42.921\nsomething wrong with your partner.\n\n00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:44.944\nI think a lot of families are fractured\n\n00:13:44.944 --> 00:13:46.929\nby unrealistic expectations\n\n00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:49.974\nthat are based upon this false\nvision of human sexuality.\n\n00:13:49.974 --> 00:13:51.438\nThat's what I'm trying to get at.\n\n00:13:51.438 --> 00:13:53.937\nCA: Thank you.

Let's find the courage to open up", "duration": "562", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ash_beckham_we_re_all_hiding_something_let_s_find_the_courage_to_open_up", "transcript": "I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in the traditional sense, not just the gay closet. I think we all have closets. Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time, or telling someone that you're pregnant, or telling someone you have cancer, or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives. All a closet is is a hard conversation, and although our topics may vary tremendously, the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal. It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.Several years ago, I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe, a local diner in town, and during my time there I would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity: not shaving my armpits, quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel. And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently I had shaved my head, the question would often be sprung on me, usually by a little kid:\"Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?\"And there would be an awkward silence at the table. I'd clench my jaw a little tighter, hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance. The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid. But I would say nothing, and I would seethe inside. And it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight. (Laughter) And that is a terrible feeling. So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something. I would have that hard conversation.So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.\"Are you a boy or are you a girl?\"Familiar silence, but this time I'm ready, and I am about to go all Women's Studies 101 on this table. (Laughter) I've got my Betty Friedan quotes. I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes. I've even got this little bit from \"Vagina Monologues\" I'm going to do. So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress, not a challenge to a feminist duel, just a kid with a question: \"Are you a boy or are you a girl?\"So I take another deep breath, squat down to next to her, and say, \"Hey, I know it's kind of confusing. My hair is short like a boy's, and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress, and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies? Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl.\"And this kid looks me dead in the eye, without missing a beat, and says, \"My favorite pajamas are purple with fish. Can I get a pancake, please?\" (Laughter) And that was it. Just, \"Oh, okay. You're a girl. How about that pancake?\"It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had. And why? Because Pancake Girl and I, we were both real with each other.So like many of us, I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah, most often, my walls happened to be rainbow. But inside, in the dark, you can't tell what color the walls are. You just know what it feels like to live in a closet. So really, my closet is no different than yours or yours or yours. Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours, but here's the thing: Hard is not relative. Hard is hard. Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them? Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five-year-old  you're getting a divorce? There is no harder, there is just hard. We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the  fact that we all have hard. At some point in our lives, we all live in closets, and they may feel safe, or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door. But I am here to tell you, no matter what your walls are made of, a closet is no place for a person to live.Thanks. (Applause)So imagine yourself 20 years ago. Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress, and high-heeled shoes. I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe. I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade, and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done. My family, my friends, complete strangers \u2014 I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people, and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose. I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long, but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.One of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister's wedding. (Laughter) It was the first time that many in attendance knew I was gay, so in doing  my maid of honor duties, in my black dress and heels, I walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends, folks that had known me for years. And after a little small talk, one of the women shouted out, \"I love Nathan Lane!\" And the battle of gay relatability had begun.\"Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?\"\"Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francisco.\"\"Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous.\"\"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio? He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend.\"\"Ash, what's your favorite TV show? Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will & Grace. And you know who we love? Jack. Jack is our favorite.\"And then one woman, stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support, to let me know she was on my side, she finally blurted out, \"Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts.\" (Laughter)And I had a choice in that moment, as all grenade throwers do. I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table and mock their responses, chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct  gay hoops I had brought with me, or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done, that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets. Sure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt short. It's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying. And what else can you ask someone to do but try? If you're going to be real with someone, you gotta be ready for real in return.So hard conversations are still not my strong suit. Ask anybody I have ever dated. But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles. Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses, but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same.Number one: Be authentic. Take the armor off. Be yourself. That kid in the cafe had no armor, but I was ready for battle. If you want someone to be real with you, they need to know that you bleed too.Number two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off. If you know you are gay, just say it. If you tell your parents you might be gay, they will hold out hope that this will change. Do not give them that sense of false hope. (Laughter)And number three, and most important \u2014 (Laughter) Be unapologetic. You are speaking your truth. Never apologize for that. And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way, so sure, apologize for what you've done, but never apologize for who you are. And yeah, some folks may be disappointed, but that is on them, not on you. Those are their expectations of who you are, not yours. That is their story, not yours. The only story that matters is the one that you want to write. So the next time you find yourself in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade, know we have all been there before. And you may feel so very alone, but you are not. And we know it's hard but we need you out here, no matter what your walls are made of, because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live.Thank you, Boulder.

You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain, and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain, ringed red, there's obvious damage \u2014 atrophy, scarring. And I could show you equivalent pictures from other disease: multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, even Huntington's disease, and they would all tell a similar story. And collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time. And the numbers here are really rather staggering. At any one time, there are 35 million people today living with one of these brain diseases, and the annual cost globally is 700 billion dollars. I mean, just think about that. That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. And it gets worse, because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large age-related diseases, and we're living longer. So the question we really need to ask ourselves is, why, given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual, never mind the scale of the societal problem, why are there no effective treatments?Now in order to consider this, I first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works. So in other words, I need to tell you everything I learned at medical school. (Laughter) But believe me, this isn't going to take very long. Okay? (Laughter) So the brain is terribly simple: it's made up of four cells, and two of them are shown here. There's the nerve cell, and then there's the myelinating cell, or the insulating cell. It's called oligodendrocyte. And when these four cells work together in health and harmony, they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity, and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think, to emote, to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on. But equally, each of these individual four cells alone or together, can go rogue or die, and when that happens, you get damage. You get damaged wiring. You get disrupted connections. And that's evident here with the slower conduction. But ultimately, this damage will manifest as disease, clearly. And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve, for example, you'll get motor neuron disease.So I'd like to give you a real-life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease. So this is a patient of mine called John. John I saw just last week in the clinic. And I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease.John: I was diagnosed in October in 2011, and the main problem was a breathing problem, difficulty breathing.Siddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you caught all of that, but what John was telling us was that difficulty with breathing led eventually to the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.So John's now 18 months further down in that journey, and I've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament.John: What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse. I've got weakness in my hands,  my arms and my legs. So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.SC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair most of the time.So what these two clips show is not just the devastating consequence of the disease, but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease, because in just 18 months, a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair- and respirator-dependent. And let's face it, John could be anybody's father, brother or friend.So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies. But what happens when that myelin cell dies? You get multiple sclerosis. So the scan on your left is an illustration of the brain, and it's a map of the connections of the brain, and superimposed upon which are areas of damage. We call them lesions of demyelination. But they're damage, and they're white.So I know what you're thinking here. You're thinking, \"My God, this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope, and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale.\" I've told you these diseases are terrible. They're devastating, numbers are rising, the costs are ridiculous, and worst of all, we have no treatment. Where's the hope?Well, you know what? I think there is hope. And there's hope in this next section, of this brain section of somebody else with M.S., because what it illustrates is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself. It just doesn't do it well enough. And so again, there are two things I want to show you. First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S. And again, it's another one of these white masses. But crucially, the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. But that area that is pale blue was once white. So it was damaged. It's now repaired. Just to be clear: It's not because of doctors. It's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors. This is spontaneous repair. It's amazing and it's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain, even, which can enable new myelin, new insulation, to be laid down over the damaged nerves. And this observation is important for two reasons. The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school, or at least I did, admittedly last century, which is that the brain doesn't repair itself, unlike, say, the bone or the liver. But actually it does, but it just doesn't do it well enough. And the second thing it does, and it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies \u2014 I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here. You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous, spontaneous repair that occurs anyway.So the question is, why, if we've known that for some time, as we have, why do we not have those treatments? And that in part reflects the complexity of drug development. Now, drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet, and the odds of this bet are roughly this: they're 10,000 to one against, because you need to screen about 10,000 compounds to find that one potential winner. And then you need to spend 15 years and spend over a billion dollars, and even then, you may not have a winner.So the question for us is, can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds? And in order to do that, you have to think, where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery? And one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery. All that screening occurs in animal models. But we know that the proper  study of mankind is man, to borrow from Alexander Pope. So the question is, can we study these diseases using human material? And of course, absolutely we can. We can use stem cells, and specifically we can use human stem cells. And human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things: they can self-renew or make more of themselves, but they can also become specialized to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells, maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell. And the challenge has long been, can we harness the power, the undoubted power of these stem cells in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology?And I think we can now, and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last 10, 20 years. One of them was here in Edinburgh, and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly. So Dolly was made in Edinburgh, and Dolly was an example of the first cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. But I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka. And what Yamaka did, in a fantastic form of scientific cookery, was he showed that four ingredients, just four ingredients, could effectively convert any cell, adult cell, into a master stem cell. And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate, because what it means that from anybody in this room, but particularly patients, you could now generate a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit. Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell, so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease, both to study but potentially to treat. Now, the idea of that at medical school \u2014 this is a recurring theme, isn't  it, me and medical school? \u2014 would have been ridiculous, but it's an absolute reality today. And I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration, repair and hope.And whilst we're on the theme of hope, for those of you who might have failed at school, there's hope for you as well, because this is the school report of John Gerdon. [\"I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.\"] So they didn't think much of him then. But what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine just three months ago.So to return to the original problem, what is the opportunity of these stem cells, or this disruptive technology, for repairing the damaged brain, which we call regenerative neurology? I think there are two ways you can think about this: as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool, and/or as a form of therapy. So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments.Drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this. It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease, let's say motor neuron disease, you take a skin sample, you do the pluripotent reprogramming, as I've already told you, and you generate live motor nerve cells. That's straightforward, because that's what pluripotent cells can do. But crucially, you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts, ideally from an unaffected relative. That way, you're matching for genetic variation.And that's exactly what we did here. This was a collaboration with colleagues: in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S.,  Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis. And what you're looking at, and this is amazing, these are living, growing, motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease. It happens to be an inherited form. I mean, just imagine that. This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes, we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce, but crucially, we can then track their individual health and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones. And when you do all that and put it together, you realize that the diseased ones, which is represented in the red line, are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart. And the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs, because what would you ask of the drugs, and you could do this through a high-throughput automated screening system, you'd ask the drugs, give me one thing: find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line, because that drug will be a high-value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that I've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models, if that makes sense. It's fantastic.But I want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage. And again there are two ways to think about this, and they're not mutually exclusive. The first, and I think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend, but it's not thought of that way just yet, is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain, and I've told you that. All of us have stem cells in the brain, even the diseased brain, and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it. That will be the future. There will be drugs that will do that.But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells, transplant them in, to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain. And I want to tell you now an experiment, it's a clinical trial that we did, which recently completed, which is with colleagues in UCL, David Miller in particular. So this study was very simple. We took patients with multiple sclerosis and asked a simple question: Would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves? So what we did was we took this bone marrow, grew up the stem cells in the lab, and then injected them back into the vein. I'm making this sound really simple. It took five years off a lot of people, okay? And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. But conceptually, it's essentially simple. So we've given them into the vein, right? So in order to measure whether this was successful or not, we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure. And that's a good thing to measure in M.S., because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision \u2014 loss of vision, unclear vision. And so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with David Miller three times \u2014 12 months, six months, and before the infusion \u2014 and you can see the gently declining red line. And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking, which makes sense, because their nerves are dying. We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice \u2014 three months and six months \u2014 and to our surprise, almost, the line's gone up. That suggests that the intervention has been protective. I don't think myself that what's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves. What I think they've done is they've promoted the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells, to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin. So this is a proof of concept. I'm very excited about that.So I just want to end with the theme I began on, which was regeneration and hope. So here I've asked John what his hopes are for the future.John: I would hope that sometime in the future through the research that you people are doing, we can come up with a cure so that people like me can lead a normal life.SC: I mean, that speaks volumes.But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John \u2014 thanking John for allowing me to share his insights and these clips with you all. But I'd also like to add to John and to others that my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future. I do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you do offer very real hope. And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. Thank you.

give you a real-life illustration\n\n00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.975\nof what happens with motor neuron disease.\n\n00:03:15.975 --> 00:03:18.504\nSo this is a patient of mine called John.\n\n00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:21.517\nJohn I saw just last week in the clinic.\n\n00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:25.141\nAnd I've asked John to tell us something \nabout what were his problems\n\n00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:27.040\nthat led to the initial diagnosis\n\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.679\nof motor neuron disease.\n\n00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:33.628\nJohn: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,\n\n00:03:33.628 --> 00:03:37.208\nand the main problem was a breathing problem,\n\n00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:38.901\ndifficulty breathing.\n\n00:03:38.901 --> 00:03:41.161\nSiddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you\ncaught all of that, but what John was telling us\n\n00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:43.401\nwas that difficulty with breathing\n\n00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:45.495\nled eventually to the diagnosis\n\n00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:48.348\nof motor neuron disease.\n\n00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:51.912\nSo John's now 18 months\nfurther down in that journey,\n\n00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:54.145\nand I've now asked him to tell us something about\n\n00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:56.434\nhis current predicament.\n\n00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:59.294\nJohn: What I've got now is \nthe breathing's gotten worse.\n\n00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:04.991\nI've got weakness in my hands, \nmy arms and my legs.\n\n00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:09.811\nSo basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.\n\n00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:12.637\nSC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair\n\n00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.761\nmost of the time.\n\n00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:16.979\nSo what these two clips show\n\n00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.735\nis not just the devastating\nconsequence of the disease,\n\n00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:21.278\nbut they also tell us something about\n\n00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:23.578\nthe shocking pace of the disease,\n\n00:04:23.578 --> 00:04:26.890\nbecause in just 18 months,\n\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.586\na fit adult man has been rendered\n\n00:04:29.586 --> 00:04:32.917\nwheelchair- and respirator-dependent.\n\n00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:35.222\nAnd let's face it, John could be anybody's father,\n\n00:04:35.222 --> 00:04:37.409\nbrother or friend.\n\n00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.662\nSo that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.\n\n00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:44.262\nBut what happens when that myelin cell dies?\n\n00:04:44.262 --> 00:04:46.482\nYou get multiple sclerosis.\n\n00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:48.301\nSo the scan on your left\n\n00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:51.024\nis an illustration of the brain,\n\n00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:53.875\nand it's a map of the connections of the brain,\n\n00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:55.842\nand superimposed upon which\n\n00:04:55.842 --> 00:04:57.216\nare areas of damage.\n\n00:04:57.216 --> 00:04:59.407\nWe call them lesions of demyelination.\n\n00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:02.239\nBut they're damage, and they're white.\n\n00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:03.754\nSo I know what you're thinking here.\n\n00:05:03.754 --> 00:05:06.262\nYou're thinking, \"My God, this bloke came up\n\n00:05:06.262 --> 00:05:08.193\nand said he's going to talk about hope,\n\n00:05:08.193 --> 00:05:10.702\nand all he's done is give a really rather bleak\n\n00:05:10.702 --> 00:05:12.266\nand depressing tale.\"\n\n00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:13.861\nI've told you these diseases are terrible.\n\n00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:16.522\nThey're devastating, numbers are rising,\n\n00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:18.649\nthe costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,\n\n00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:20.935\nwe have no treatment. Where's the hope?\n\n00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:23.480\nWell, you know what? I think there is hope.\n\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.874\nAnd there's hope in this next section,\n\n00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:28.169\nof this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,\n\n00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.697\nbecause what it illustrates\n\n00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:32.170\nis, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.\n\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.748\nIt just doesn't do it well enough.\n\n00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:36.873\nAnd so again, there are two\nthings I want to show you.\n\n00:05:36.873 --> 00:05:40.299\nFirst of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.\n\n00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:43.782\nAnd again, it's another one of these white masses.\n\n00:05:43.782 --> 00:05:47.220\nBut crucially, the area that's ringed red\n\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.443\nhighlights an area that is pale blue.\n\n00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:52.269\nBut that area that is pale blue was once white.\n\n00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.880\nSo it was damaged. It's now repaired.\n\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.642\nJust to be clear: It's not because of doctors.\n\n00:05:58.642 --> 00:06:00.959\nIt's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.\n\n00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:03.142\nThis is spontaneous repair.\n\n00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:04.690\nIt's amazing and it's occurred\n\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.904\nbecause there are stem cells in the brain, even,\n\n00:06:07.904 --> 00:06:11.078\nwhich can enable new myelin, new insulation,\n\n00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:13.407\nto be laid down over the damaged nerves.\n\n00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:17.894\nAnd this observation is important for two reasons.\n\n00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:21.134\nThe first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies\n\n00:06:21.134 --> 00:06:22.763\nthat we learnt at medical school,\n\n00:06:22.763 --> 00:06:26.383\nor at least I did, admittedly last century,\n\n00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:28.954\nwhich is that the brain doesn't repair itself,\n\n00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:32.075\nunlike, say, the bone or the liver.\n\n00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:35.574\nBut actually it does, but it\njust doesn't do it well enough.\n\n00:06:35.574 --> 00:06:37.216\nAnd the second thing it does,\n\n00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:41.191\nand it gives us a very clear direction \nof travel for new therapies --\n\n00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:42.910\nI mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist\n\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.430\nto know what to do here.\n\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.363\nYou simply need to find ways of promoting\n\n00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:51.887\nthe endogenous, spontaneous\nrepair that occurs anyway.\n\n00:06:51.887 --> 00:06:54.344\nSo the question is, why, if we've known that\n\n00:06:54.344 --> 00:06:56.301\nfor some time, as we have,\n\n00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.595\nwhy do we not have those treatments?\n\n00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:02.714\nAnd that in part reflects the complexity\n\n00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.325\nof drug development.\n\n00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.359\nNow, drug development you might think of\n\n00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.083\nas a rather expensive but risky bet,\n\n00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:12.036\nand the odds of this bet are roughly this:\n\n00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:14.633\nthey're 10,000 to one against,\n\n00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:17.438\nbecause you need to screen\nabout 10,000 compounds\n\n00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:19.509\nto find that one potential winner.\n\n00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:21.426\nAnd then you need to spend 15 years\n\n00:07:21.426 --> 00:07:22.924\nand spend over a billion dollars,\n\n00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:26.067\nand even then, you may not have a winner.\n\n00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:27.746\nSo the question for us is,\n\n00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:29.337\ncan you change the rules of the game\n\n00:07:29.337 --> 00:07:31.886\nand can you shorten the odds?\n\n00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.930\nAnd in order to do that, you have to think,\n\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.760\nwhere is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?\n\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.873\nAnd one of the bottlenecks is \nearly in drug discovery.\n\n00:07:39.873 --> 00:07:43.835\nAll that screening occurs in animal models.\n\n00:07:43.835 --> 00:07:47.294\nBut we know that the proper \nstudy of mankind is man,\n\n00:07:47.294 --> 00:07:49.398\nto borrow from Alexander Pope.\n\n00:07:49.398 --> 00:07:51.769\nSo the question is, can we study these diseases\n\n00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:54.157\nusing human material?\n\n00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.220\nAnd of course, absolutely we can.\n\n00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.749\nWe can use stem cells,\n\n00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:00.549\nand specifically we can use human stem cells.\n\n00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:02.653\nAnd human stem cells are these extraordinary\n\n00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:05.055\nbut simple cells that can do two things:\n\n00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:07.849\nthey can self-renew or make more of themselves,\n\n00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:09.907\nbut they can also become specialized\n\n00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:12.506\nto make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,\n\n00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:14.346\nmaybe even the motor nerve cell\n\n00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:16.506\nor the myelin cell.\n\n00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:18.027\nAnd the challenge has long been,\n\n00:08:18.027 --> 00:08:19.999\ncan we harness the power,\n\n00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.284\nthe undoubted power of these stem cells\n\n00:08:22.284 --> 00:08:24.302\nin order to realize their promise\n\n00:08:24.302 --> 00:08:25.929\nfor regenerative neurology?\n\n00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:28.858\nAnd I think we can now, and the reason we can\n\n00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:31.766\nis because there have been\nseveral major discoveries\n\n00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:33.503\nin the last 10, 20 years.\n\n00:08:33.503 --> 00:08:35.115\nOne of them was here in Edinburgh,\n\n00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:39.227\nand it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.\n\n00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.852\nSo Dolly was made in Edinburgh,\n\n00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:42.535\nand Dolly was an example\n\n00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:45.749\nof the first cloning of a mammal\n\n00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:47.697\nfrom an adult cell.\n\n00:08:47.697 --> 00:08:50.502\nBut I think the even more significant breakthrough\n\n00:08:50.502 --> 00:08:53.424\nfor the purposes of our discussion today\n\n00:08:53.424 --> 00:08:55.913\nwas made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist\n\n00:08:55.913 --> 00:08:57.510\ncalled Yamanaka.\n\n00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.814\nAnd what Yamaka did,\n\n00:08:58.814 --> 00:09:01.246\nin a fantastic form of scientific cookery,\n\n00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:03.284\nwas he showed that four ingredients,\n\n00:09:03.284 --> 00:09:05.147\njust four ingredients,\n\n00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:08.334\ncould effectively convert any cell, adult cell,\n\n00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:10.576\ninto a master stem cell.\n\n00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:13.560\nAnd the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,\n\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.800\nbecause what it means that\nfrom anybody in this room,\n\n00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.604\nbut particularly patients,\n\n00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:18.935\nyou could now generate\n\n00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:21.661\na bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.\n\n00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.609\nTake a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,\n\n00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:26.348\nso you could then make those cells\n\n00:09:26.348 --> 00:09:28.787\nthat are relevant to their disease,\n\n00:09:28.787 --> 00:09:31.429\nboth to study but potentially to treat.\n\n00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:33.491\nNow, the idea of that at medical school --\n\n00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:36.116\nthis is a recurring theme, isn't \nit, me and medical school? \u2014\n\n00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:37.934\nwould have been ridiculous,\n\n00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:39.993\nbut it's an absolute reality today.\n\n00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:42.127\nAnd I see this as the cornerstone\n\n00:09:42.127 --> 00:09:45.304\nof regeneration, repair and hope.\n\n00:09:45.304 --> 00:09:47.254\nAnd whilst we're on the theme of hope,\n\n00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:49.395\nfor those of you who might have failed at school,\n\n00:09:49.395 --> 00:09:51.620\nthere's hope for you as well,\n\n00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.116\nbecause this is the school report of John Gerdon.\n\n00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:55.328\n[\"I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist;\non his present showing this is quite ridiculous.\"]\n\n00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.764\nSo they didn't think much of him then.\n\n00:09:56.764 --> 00:09:59.622\nBut what you may not know is that he \ngot the Nobel Prize for medicine\n\n00:09:59.622 --> 00:10:02.174\njust three months ago.\n\n00:10:02.174 --> 00:10:04.740\nSo to return to the original problem,\n\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.883\nwhat is the opportunity of these stem cells,\n\n00:10:06.883 --> 00:10:08.544\nor this disruptive technology,\n\n00:10:08.544 --> 00:10:10.098\nfor repairing the damaged brain,\n\n00:10:10.098 --> 00:10:12.229\nwhich we call regenerative neurology?\n\n00:10:12.229 --> 00:10:14.656\nI think there are two ways you can think about this:\n\n00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:18.104\nas a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,\n\n00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:20.921\nand/or as a form of therapy.\n\n00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.948\nSo I want to tell you a little bit about both of those\n\n00:10:22.948 --> 00:10:25.397\nin the next few moments.\n\n00:10:25.397 --> 00:10:27.428\nDrug discovery in a dish is how people often\n\n00:10:27.428 --> 00:10:28.658\ntalk about this.\n\n00:10:28.658 --> 00:10:31.585\nIt's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,\n\n00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:33.404\nlet's say motor neuron disease,\n\n00:10:33.404 --> 00:10:35.161\nyou take a skin sample,\n\n00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.219\nyou do the pluripotent reprogramming,\n\n00:10:38.219 --> 00:10:40.310\nas I've already told you,\n\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.827\nand you generate live motor nerve cells.\n\n00:10:42.827 --> 00:10:44.561\nThat's straightforward, because that's what\n\n00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.298\npluripotent cells can do.\n\n00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:49.254\nBut crucially, you can then compare their behavior\n\n00:10:49.254 --> 00:10:51.677\nto their equivalent but healthy counterparts,\n\n00:10:51.677 --> 00:10:53.707\nideally from an unaffected relative.\n\n00:10:53.707 --> 00:10:56.949\nThat way, you're matching for genetic variation.\n\n00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:59.296\nAnd that's exactly what we did here.\n\n00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:01.219\nThis was a collaboration with colleagues:\n\n00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:04.742\nin London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., \nSteve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.\n\n00:11:04.742 --> 00:11:07.264\nAnd what you're looking at, and this is amazing,\n\n00:11:07.264 --> 00:11:10.064\nthese are living, growing, motor nerve cells\n\n00:11:10.064 --> 00:11:12.307\nfrom a patient with motor neuron disease.\n\n00:11:12.307 --> 00:11:14.232\nIt happens to be an inherited form.\n\n00:11:14.232 --> 00:11:15.931\nI mean, just imagine that.\n\n00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:18.412\nThis would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.\n\n00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:21.766\nSo apart from seeing them\ngrow and put out processes,\n\n00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:24.208\nwe can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,\n\n00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:27.267\nbut crucially, we can then\ntrack their individual health\n\n00:11:27.267 --> 00:11:29.787\nand compare the diseased motor nerve cells\n\n00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:31.659\nto the healthy ones.\n\n00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:35.146\nAnd when you do all that and put it together,\n\n00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:37.245\nyou realize that the diseased ones,\n\n00:11:37.245 --> 00:11:39.033\nwhich is represented in the red line,\n\n00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:42.654\nare two and a half times more likely to die\n\n00:11:42.654 --> 00:11:45.359\nthan the healthy counterpart.\n\n00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:48.002\nAnd the crucial point about this is that you then have\n\n00:11:48.002 --> 00:11:51.591\na fantastic assay to discover drugs,\n\n00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:53.500\nbecause what would you ask of the drugs,\n\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.261\nand you could do this through a high-throughput\n\n00:11:55.261 --> 00:11:57.670\nautomated screening system,\n\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.116\nyou'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:\n\n00:12:00.116 --> 00:12:02.941\nfind me a drug that will bring the red line\n\n00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:04.831\ncloser to the blue line,\n\n00:12:04.831 --> 00:12:08.050\nbecause that drug will be a high-value candidate\n\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.950\nthat you could probably take direct to human trial\n\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.537\nand almost bypass that bottleneck\n\n00:12:13.537 --> 00:12:15.938\nthat I've told you about in drug discovery\n\n00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:17.751\nwith the animal models,\n\n00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:20.404\nif that makes sense. It's fantastic.\n\n00:12:20.404 --> 00:12:21.968\nBut I want to come back\n\n00:12:21.968 --> 00:12:24.017\nto how you might use stem cells directly\n\n00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:25.792\nto repair damage.\n\n00:12:25.792 --> 00:12:27.617\nAnd again there are two ways to think about this,\n\n00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:29.632\nand they're not mutually exclusive.\n\n00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:31.922\nThe first, and I think in the long run\n\n00:12:31.922 --> 00:12:34.151\nthe one that will give us the biggest dividend,\n\n00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:36.755\nbut it's not thought of that way just yet,\n\n00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:40.011\nis to think about those stem cells that are already\n\n00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:41.851\nin your brain, and I've told you that.\n\n00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:43.705\nAll of us have stem cells in the brain,\n\n00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:45.340\neven the diseased brain,\n\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.958\nand surely the smart way forward\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.455\nis to find ways that you can promote and activate\n\n00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:51.491\nthose stem cells in your brain already\n\n00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:54.678\nto react and respond appropriately to damage\n\n00:12:54.678 --> 00:12:55.962\nto repair it.\n\n00:12:55.962 --> 00:12:57.394\nThat will be the future.\n\n00:12:57.394 --> 00:13:00.267\nThere will be drugs that will do that.\n\n00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:04.530\nBut the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,\n\n00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.334\ntransplant them in,\n\n00:13:06.334 --> 00:13:10.812\nto replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.\n\n00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:12.900\nAnd I want to tell you now an experiment,\n\n00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.794\nit's a clinical trial that we did,\n\n00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.650\nwhich recently completed,\n\n00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.167\nwhich is with colleagues in UCL,\n\n00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:21.922\nDavid Miller in particular.\n\n00:13:21.922 --> 00:13:23.835\nSo this study was very simple.\n\n00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:26.937\nWe took patients with multiple sclerosis\n\n00:13:26.937 --> 00:13:28.475\nand asked a simple question:\n\n00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.149\nWould stem cells from the bone marrow\n\n00:13:30.149 --> 00:13:31.872\nbe protective of their nerves?\n\n00:13:31.872 --> 00:13:35.717\nSo what we did was we took this bone marrow,\n\n00:13:35.717 --> 00:13:37.934\ngrew up the stem cells in the lab,\n\n00:13:37.934 --> 00:13:40.273\nand then injected them back into the vein.\n\n00:13:40.273 --> 00:13:42.073\nI'm making this sound really simple.\n\n00:13:42.073 --> 00:13:45.180\nIt took five years off a lot of people, okay?\n\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.868\nAnd it put gray hair on me\n\n00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.349\nand caused all kinds of issues.\n\n00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:52.372\nBut conceptually, it's essentially simple.\n\n00:13:52.372 --> 00:13:55.679\nSo we've given them into the vein, right?\n\n00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:59.312\nSo in order to measure whether\nthis was successful or not,\n\n00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:01.060\nwe measured the optic nerve\n\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.746\nas our outcome measure.\n\n00:14:02.746 --> 00:14:04.511\nAnd that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,\n\n00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.584\nbecause patients with M.S. sadly suffer\n\n00:14:06.584 --> 00:14:08.056\nwith problems with vision --\n\n00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.246\nloss of vision, unclear vision.\n\n00:14:10.246 --> 00:14:12.329\nAnd so we measured the size of the optic nerve\n\n00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:14.383\nusing the scans with David Miller\n\n00:14:14.383 --> 00:14:16.481\nthree times -- 12 months, six months,\n\n00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.097\nand before the infusion --\n\n00:14:18.097 --> 00:14:21.223\nand you can see the gently declining red line.\n\n00:14:21.223 --> 00:14:23.451\nAnd that's telling you that\nthe optic nerve is shrinking,\n\n00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:25.794\nwhich makes sense, because their nerves are dying.\n\n00:14:25.794 --> 00:14:28.100\nWe then gave the stem cell infusion\n\n00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.201\nand repeated the measurement twice --\n\n00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:31.840\nthree months and six months --\n\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.813\nand to our surprise, almost,\n\n00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:35.969\nthe line's gone up.\n\n00:14:35.969 --> 00:14:38.500\nThat suggests that the intervention\n\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.397\nhas been protective.\n\n00:14:40.397 --> 00:14:42.314\nI don't think myself that what's happened\n\n00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:44.350\nis that those stem cells have made new myelin\n\n00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.814\nor new nerves.\n\n00:14:45.814 --> 00:14:47.959\nWhat I think they've done is they've promoted\n\n00:14:47.959 --> 00:14:50.568\nthe endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,\n\n00:14:50.568 --> 00:14:54.019\nto do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.\n\n00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.318\nSo this is a proof of concept.\n\n00:14:56.318 --> 00:14:58.943\nI'm very excited about that.\n\n00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:01.432\nSo I just want to end with the theme I began on,\n\n00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:03.422\nwhich was regeneration and hope.\n\n00:15:03.422 --> 00:15:05.192\nSo here I've asked John\n\n00:15:05.192 --> 00:15:07.490\nwhat his hopes are for the future.\n\n00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.244\nJohn: I would hope that\n\n00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:11.044\nsometime in the future\n\n00:15:11.044 --> 00:15:13.484\nthrough the research that you people are doing,\n\n00:15:13.484 --> 00:15:15.693\nwe can come up with a cure\n\n00:15:15.693 --> 00:15:19.517\nso that people like me can lead a normal life.\n\n00:15:19.517 --> 00:15:22.112\nSC: I mean, that speaks volumes.\n\n00:15:22.112 --> 00:15:24.651\nBut I'd like to close by first of all thanking John --\n\n00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:26.380\nthanking John for allowing me to share\n\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.550\nhis insights and these clips with you all.\n\n00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.085\nBut I'd also like to add to John and to others\n\n00:15:32.085 --> 00:15:34.662\nthat my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.\n\n00:15:34.662 --> 00:15:37.014\nI do believe that the disruptive technologies\n\n00:15:37.014 --> 00:15:39.072\nlike stem cells that I've tried to explain to you\n\n00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:40.893\ndo offer very real hope.\n\n00:15:40.893 --> 00:15:42.656\nAnd I do think that the day that we might be able\n\n00:15:42.656 --> 00:15:44.092\nto repair the damaged brain\n\n00:15:44.092 --> 00:15:45.381\nis sooner than we think.\n\n00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:47.184\nThank you.\n\n00:15:47.184 --> 00:15:51.877\n(Applause)"},

hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin, but I'm going to explain to you why it should be.The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous, or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity, or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of.But like most things in technology and the technology world, hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system, and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a  problem, you work to fix it, and not just complain about it. And in many ways, hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs, hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy.So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today, it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is, you think not of this guy but of this guy, Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors, though he famously never filed a patent, because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod, and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy.And in Code For America, we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people, and we call those people civic hackers.So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy, like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise, are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government.But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like, I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a 21st-century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers.So what does civic hacking look like? Our team last year in Honolulu, which in this case was three full-time fellows who were doing a year of public service, were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead, they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions, and they want to take action when they're done, which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers, which is a super-simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build, but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time, especially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical, when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack-a-thon. They held a write-a-thon, where on one Saturday afternoon \u2014 (\"What do I do about wild pigs  being a nuisance?\") (Laughter) \u2014 Wild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu, apparently. In one Saturday afternoon, they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions, but more importantly than that, they created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government.Now, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself, but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland, where I live, the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers, and again we held a write-a-thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them, and I got into the act. I authored this answer, and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking, we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government.At this point, you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know, cities are being asked every day to do more with less, and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting, cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government.Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe, and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City, where earlier this year, the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this, especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets, they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper, and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars \u2014 10,000 times cheaper than the government contract, and they gave the entrants 10 days. And in those 10 days, they submitted 173 apps, five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action, that contract was vacated, and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners, Code for Mexico City.And so what you see in all three of these places, in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City, are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them, and through that work, they're creating a 21st-century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved, besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government.So back to our friend Ben Franklin, who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments was that in 1736 he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia, called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city, so in true civic hacker fashion, they built a solution.And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described, and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have 31 brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the  brigade to international cities for the first time, starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org, and if there's not a brigade where you live, we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org, and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems, that will support local government, and that will empower citizens.So please come hack with us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1933, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:14.317\nI'm

\nproblem, you work to fix it,\n\n00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.216\nand not just complain about it.\n\n00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:31.126\nAnd in many ways, hacking is what built America.\n\n00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:33.271\nBetsy Ross was a hacker.\n\n00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:36.466\nThe Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.\n\n00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.342\nAnd from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,\n\n00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:41.881\nhacking has always been at the foundation\n\n00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.933\nof American democracy.\n\n00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:49.234\nSo if there's one thing I want\nto leave you here with today,\n\n00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.805\nit's that the next time you\nthink about who a hacker is,\n\n00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:55.827\nyou think not of this guy\n\n00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:58.407\nbut of this guy, Benjamin Franklin,\n\n00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:01.365\nwho was one of the greatest hackers of all time.\n\n00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:03.506\nHe was one of America's most prolific inventors,\n\n00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:05.688\nthough he famously never filed a patent,\n\n00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:07.282\nbecause he thought that all human knowledge\n\n00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:09.910\nshould be freely available.\n\n00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.942\nHe brought us bifocals and the lightning rod,\n\n00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:15.139\nand of course there was his collaboration\n\n00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.104\non the invention of American democracy.\n\n00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.427\nAnd in Code For America, we really try to embody\n\n00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:22.445\nthe spirit of Ben Franklin.\n\n00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:25.887\nHe was a tinkerer and a statesman\n\n00:02:25.887 --> 00:02:27.747\nwhose conception of citizenship\n\n00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.834\nwas always predicated on action.\n\n00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.619\nHe believed that government could be built\n\n00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.259\nby the people,\n\n00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.808\nand we call those people civic hackers.\n\n00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:41.263\nSo it's no wonder that the values\n\n00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:43.931\nthat underly a healthy democracy,\n\n00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:46.924\nlike collaboration and empowerment\n\n00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:48.987\nand participation and enterprise,\n\n00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:52.473\nare the same values that underly the Internet.\n\n00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:54.569\nAnd so it's no surprise that many hackers\n\n00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.926\nare turning their attention to\nthe problem of government.\n\n00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:59.979\nBut before I give you a few examples\n\n00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.801\nof what civic hacking looks like,\n\n00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:03.317\nI want to make clear that you don't have\n\n00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:05.411\nto be a programmer to be a civic hacker.\n\n00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.166\nYou just have to believe that you can bring\n\n00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.433\na 21st-century tool set to bear\n\n00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:11.872\non the problems that government faces.\n\n00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:13.917\nAnd we hear all the time from our community\n\n00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:16.205\nof civic hackers at Code for America\n\n00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:18.813\nthat they didn't understand\nhow much nontechnical work\n\n00:03:18.813 --> 00:03:20.839\nactually went into civic hacking projects.\n\n00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.330\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.420\nAll of you are potential civic hackers.\n\n00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.440\nSo what does civic hacking look like?\n\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.704\nOur team last year in Honolulu,\n\n00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:33.319\nwhich in this case was three full-time fellows\n\n00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.471\nwho were doing a year of public service,\n\n00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:39.436\nwere asked by the city to rebuild the website.\n\n00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:42.515\nAnd it's a massive thing of\ntens of thousands of pages\n\n00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.631\nwhich just wasn't going to be possible\n\n00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:46.384\nin the few months that they had.\n\n00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:48.841\nSo instead, they decided to build a parallel site\n\n00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:51.303\nthat better conformed to how citizens actually\n\n00:03:51.303 --> 00:03:54.642\nwant to interact with information on a city website.\n\n00:03:54.642 --> 00:03:56.579\nThey're looking for answers to questions,\n\n00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.205\nand they want to take action when they're done,\n\n00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.491\nwhich is really hard to do from a site\n\n00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.140\nthat looks like this.\n\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.385\nSo our team built Honolulu Answers,\n\n00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:07.751\nwhich is a super-simple search interface\n\n00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.204\nwhere you enter a search term or a question\n\n00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:12.902\nand get back plain language answers\n\n00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:15.342\nthat drive a user towards action.\n\n00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:18.199\nNow the site itself was easy enough to build,\n\n00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.102\nbut the team was faced with the challenge\n\n00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:22.812\nof how they populate all of the content.\n\n00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:24.488\nIt would have taken the three of them\n\n00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:25.865\na very long time,\n\n00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.864\nespecially given that none of \nthem are actually from Honolulu.\n\n00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:30.939\nAnd so they did something that's really radical,\n\n00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.612\nwhen you think about how government\n\n00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:34.653\nis used to working.\n\n00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:37.665\nThey asked citizens to write the content.\n\n00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:39.159\nSo you've heard of a hack-a-thon.\n\n00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.823\nThey held a write-a-thon,\n\n00:04:40.823 --> 00:04:43.460\nwhere on one Saturday afternoon --\n\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.501\n(\"What do I do about wild pigs \nbeing a nuisance?\") (Laughter) \u2014\n\n00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:49.547\nWild pigs are a huge problem \nin Honolulu, apparently.\n\n00:04:49.547 --> 00:04:51.590\nIn one Saturday afternoon,\n\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.924\nthey were able to populate most of the content\n\n00:04:53.924 --> 00:04:55.585\nfor most of the frequently asked questions,\n\n00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:57.818\nbut more importantly than that,\n\n00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:01.933\nthey created a new way for citizens \nto participate in their government.\n\n00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:04.978\nNow, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,\n\n00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:07.315\nbut it gets more awesome.\n\n00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:09.921\nOn the National Day of Civic Hacking\n\n00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:12.332\nthis past June in Oakland, where I live,\n\n00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:14.361\nthe Code For America team in Oakland\n\n00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:16.561\ntook the open source code base of Honolulu Answers\n\n00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:18.572\nand turned it into Oakland Answers,\n\n00:05:18.572 --> 00:05:20.651\nand again we held a write-a-thon\n\n00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:23.999\nwhere we took the most frequently asked questions\n\n00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:25.661\nand had citizens write the answers to them,\n\n00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:27.130\nand I got into the act.\n\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.731\nI authored this answer, and a few others.\n\n00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.843\nAnd I'm trying to this day to articulate\n\n00:05:33.843 --> 00:05:36.889\nthe sense of empowerment and responsibility\n\n00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.469\nthat I feel for the place that I live\n\n00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.511\nbased simply on this small act of participation.\n\n00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.236\nAnd by stitching together my small act\n\n00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:51.042\nwith the thousands of other\nsmall acts of participation\n\n00:05:51.042 --> 00:05:53.623\nthat we're enabling through civic hacking,\n\n00:05:53.623 --> 00:05:56.407\nwe think we can reenergize citizenship\n\n00:05:56.407 --> 00:05:59.457\nand restore trust in government.\n\n00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:00.794\nAt this point, you may be wondering\n\n00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:02.520\nwhat city officials think of all this.\n\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.073\nThey actually love it.\n\n00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:06.267\nAs most of you guys know, cities are being asked\n\n00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:08.988\nevery day to do more with less,\n\n00:06:08.988 --> 00:06:11.186\nand they're always looking for innovative solutions\n\n00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:12.920\nto entrenched problems.\n\n00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.454\nSo when you give citizens a way to participate\n\n00:06:16.454 --> 00:06:18.292\nbeyond attending a town hall meeting,\n\n00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:20.244\ncities can actually capture\n\n00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:22.998\nthe capacity in their communities\n\n00:06:22.998 --> 00:06:26.033\nto do the business of government.\n\n00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:28.026\nNow I don't want to leave the impression\n\n00:06:28.026 --> 00:06:30.138\nthat civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.\n\n00:06:30.138 --> 00:06:31.841\nIt's happening across the globe,\n\n00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:33.494\nand one of my favorite examples\n\n00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:35.925\nis from Mexico City, where earlier this year,\n\n00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:38.035\nthe Mexico House of Representatives\n\n00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:42.347\nentered into a contract with\na software development firm\n\n00:06:42.347 --> 00:06:45.527\nto build an app that legislators would use\n\n00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:46.778\nto track bills.\n\n00:06:46.778 --> 00:06:49.454\nSo this was just for the handful of legislators\n\n00:06:49.454 --> 00:06:52.028\nin the House.\n\n00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:54.697\nAnd the contract was a two-year contract\n\n00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:58.623\nfor 9.3 million dollars.\n\n00:06:58.623 --> 00:07:00.975\nNow a lot of people were really angry about this,\n\n00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:03.922\nespecially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars\n\n00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:06.226\nwas an absolutely outrageous amount of money\n\n00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:08.197\nfor what was a very simple app.\n\n00:07:08.197 --> 00:07:10.626\nBut instead of taking to the streets,\n\n00:07:10.626 --> 00:07:12.834\nthey issued a challenge.\n\n00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:15.665\nThey asked programmers in Mexico\n\n00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:18.868\nto build something better and cheaper,\n\n00:07:18.868 --> 00:07:23.319\nand they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars --\n\n00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.220\n10,000 times cheaper\n\n00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.868\nthan the government contract,\n\n00:07:26.868 --> 00:07:29.971\nand they gave the entrants 10 days.\n\n00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:31.783\nAnd in those 10 days,\n\n00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:35.844\nthey submitted 173 apps,\n\n00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:38.478\nfive of which were presented to Congress\n\n00:07:38.478 --> 00:07:40.579\nand are still in the app store today.\n\n00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:42.400\nAnd because of this action,\n\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.528\nthat contract was vacated,\n\n00:07:44.528 --> 00:07:46.660\nand now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City\n\n00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.417\nwhich is home to one of our partners,\n\n00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.875\nCode for Mexico City.\n\n00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:53.626\nAnd so what you see in all three of these places,\n\n00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:56.443\nin Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,\n\n00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:59.634\nare the elements that are\nat the core of civic hacking.\n\n00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:02.657\nIt's citizens who saw things\nthat could be working better\n\n00:08:02.657 --> 00:08:04.588\nand they decided to fix them,\n\n00:08:04.588 --> 00:08:06.247\nand through that work, they're creating\n\n00:08:06.247 --> 00:08:09.438\na 21st-century ecosystem of participation.\n\n00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:11.468\nThey're creating a whole new set of ways\n\n00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:13.474\nfor citizens to be involved,\n\n00:08:13.474 --> 00:08:17.419\nbesides voting or signing a petition or protesting.\n\n00:08:17.419 --> 00:08:21.396\nThey can actually build government.\n\n00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:24.532\nSo back to our friend Ben Franklin,\n\n00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:27.278\nwho, one of his lesser-known accomplishments\n\n00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:31.153\nwas that in 1736 he founded\n\n00:08:31.153 --> 00:08:34.711\nthe first volunteer firefighting\ncompany in Philadelphia,\n\n00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:36.410\ncalled a brigade.\n\n00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.636\nAnd it's because he and his friends noticed\n\n00:08:38.636 --> 00:08:40.335\nthat the city was having trouble keeping up\n\n00:08:40.335 --> 00:08:42.405\nwith all the fires that were happening in the city,\n\n00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.194\nso in true civic hacker fashion,\n\n00:08:45.194 --> 00:08:47.844\nthey built a solution.\n\n00:08:47.844 --> 00:08:50.354\nAnd we have our own brigades at Code for America\n\n00:08:50.354 --> 00:08:53.500\nworking on the projects that I've just described,\n\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.238\nand we want to ask you\n\n00:08:55.238 --> 00:08:57.700\nto follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps\n\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.167\nand come join us.\n\n00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:01.457\nWe have 31 brigades in the U.S.\n\n00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:02.725\nWe are pleased to announce today\n\n00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:05.001\nthat we're opening up the \nbrigade to international cities\n\n00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:06.593\nfor the first time,\n\n00:09:06.593 --> 00:09:10.574\nstarting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.\n\n00:09:10.574 --> 00:09:12.673\nYou can find out if there's a brigade where you live\n\n00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:15.167\nat brigade.codeforamerica.org,\n\n00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:17.606\nand if there's not a brigade\nwhere you live, we will help you.\n\n00:09:17.606 --> 00:09:19.462\nWe've created a tool kit which also lives\n\n00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:21.026\nat brigade.codeforamerica.org,\n\n00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:23.566\nand we will support you along the way.\n\n00:09:23.566 --> 00:09:27.481\nOur

So let\u2019s print it.", "duration": "864", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_metcalfe_we_need_money_for_aid_so_let_s_print_it", "transcript": "Thirteen years ago, we set ourselves a goal to end poverty. After some success, we've hit a big hurdle. The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments, which have fallen for two consecutive years. My question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions. Can we simply print money for aid?\"Surely not.\" It's a common reaction. (Laughter) It's a quick talk. Others channel John McEnroe. \"You cannot be serious!\"Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious, thanks to these two children, who, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart of my talk. On the left, we have Pia. She lives in England. She has two loving parents, one of whom is standing right here. Dorothy, on the right, lives in rural Kenya. She's one of 13,000 orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support. I do that because I believe that Dorothy, like Pia, deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her. You'll all agree with me, I'm sure. The U.N. agrees too. Their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all.But \u2014 and here's that hurdle \u2014 can we afford our aid aspirations? History suggests not. In 1970, governments set themselves a target to increase overseas aid payments to 0.7 percent of their national income. As you can see, a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target. But then come the Millennium Development Goals, eight ambitious targets to be met by 2015. If I tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty, you get a sense of the ambition. There's also been some success. The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day has halved. But a lot remains to be done in two years. One in eight remain hungry. In the context of this auditorium, the front two rows aren't going to get any food. We can't settle for that, which is why the concern about the eighth goal, which relates to funding, which I said at the beginning is falling, is so troubling.So what can be done? Well, I work in financial markets, not development. I study the behavior of investors, how they react to policy and the economy. It gives me a different angle on the aid issue. But it took an innocent question from my then-four-year-old daughter to make me appreciate that.Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity. I didn't have any change to give him, and she was disappointed. Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book and starts scribbling. After a little while, I ask her what she's doing, and she shows me a drawing of a \u00a35 note to give to the man outside. It's so sweet, and more generous than Dad would have been. But of course I explained to her, \"You can't do that; it's not allowed.\" To which I get the classic four-year-old response: \"Why not?\" Now I'm excited, because I actually think I can answer this time. So I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon.Something about that exchange stuck with me, not because of the look of relief on Pia's face when I finally finished, but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply, a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis. To reassure investors, central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same. They funded these purchases with money they created themselves. The money wasn't actually physically printed. It's still sort of locked away in the banking system today. But the amount created was unprecedented. Together, the central banks of the U.S., U.K and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by 3.7 trillion dollars. That's three times, in fact that's more than three times, the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation. Three times!Before the crisis, this would have been utterly unthinkable, yet it was accepted remarkably quickly. The price of gold, an asset thought to protect against inflation, did jump, but investors bought other assets that offered little protection from inflation. They bought fixed income securities, bonds. They bought equities too. For all the scare stories, the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence.That confidence was based on two pillars. The first was that, after years of keeping inflation under control, central banks were trusted to take the money-printing away if inflation became a threat. Secondly, inflation simply never became a threat. As you can see, in the United States, inflation for most of this period remained below average. It was the same elsewhere.So how does all this relate to aid? Well, this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in. I was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year, and I was inspired to give a one-off donation when I remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make. So think of this: Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years, I was able to double my contribution. Brilliant.So following that conversation with my daughter, and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money-printing, and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time, this made me wonder: Could we match but just on a much grander scale? Let's call this scheme \"Print Aid.\" And here's how it might work. Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so, the central bank would be mandated to match the government's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit. Governments have been aiming to get aid to 0.7 percent for years, so let's set the limit at half of that, 0.35 percent of their income. So it would work like this: If in a given year the government gave 0.2 percent of its income to overseas aid, the central bank would simply top it up with a further 0.2 percent. So far so good.How risky is this? Well, this involves the creation of money to buy goods, not assets. It sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it. But there are two important mitigating factors here. The first is that by definition, this money printed would be spent overseas. So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country. That is unlikely for the second reason: the scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme. So let's think of an example where Print Aid was in place in the U.S., U.K. and Japan. To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years, Print Aid would have generated 200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid. What would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system? Are you read for this? You might struggle to see that at the back, because the gap is quite small. So what we're saying here is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble to save our financial systems, and you know what, it paid off. There was no inflation. Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk to print an extra 200 billion for aid? Would the risks really be that different? To me, it's not that clear. What is clear is the impact on aid. Even though this is the printing of just three central banks, the global aid that's given over this period is up by almost 40 percent. Aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is at a 40-year high. Now, we don't get to 0.7 percent. Governments are still incentivized to give. But you know what, that's the  point of a matching scheme.So I think what we've learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest, but the benefits are potentially huge. Imagine what we could do with 40 percent more funding. We might be able to feed the front row.The thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear, apart from the fact that I've run out of time, is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one. Today, money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool. That may not always be the case. Today there are universally agreed aims for international aid. That may not always be the case. Today might be the only time that these two things coincide, such that we can afford the aid that we've always aspired to give.So, can we print money for international aid? I seriously believe the question should be, why not?Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1929, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.861 -->

00:08:13.248\ninflation for most of this period\n\n00:08:13.248 --> 00:08:16.705\nremained below average.\n\n00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.977\nIt was the same elsewhere.\n\n00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:23.394\nSo how does all this relate to aid?\n\n00:08:23.394 --> 00:08:27.269\nWell, this is where Dorothy\n\n00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:29.735\nand the Mango Tree charity\n\n00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:32.293\nthat supports her comes in.\n\n00:08:32.293 --> 00:08:34.390\nI was at one of their fundraising events\n\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.610\nearlier this year,\n\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.359\nand I was inspired to give a one-off donation\n\n00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:42.197\nwhen I remembered that my firm\n\n00:08:42.197 --> 00:08:45.456\noffers to match the charitable contributions\n\n00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:48.199\nits employees make.\n\n00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:50.925\nSo think of this:\n\n00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:53.212\nInstead of just being able to help Dorothy\n\n00:08:53.212 --> 00:08:55.918\nand four of her classmates\n\n00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:58.198\nto go through secondary school for a few years,\n\n00:08:58.198 --> 00:09:02.502\nI was able to double my contribution.\n\n00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:04.915\nBrilliant.\n\n00:09:04.915 --> 00:09:10.878\nSo following that conversation with my daughter,\n\n00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:13.515\nand seeing the absence of inflation\n\n00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:15.462\nin the face of money-printing,\n\n00:09:15.462 --> 00:09:18.549\nand knowing that international aid payments\n\n00:09:18.549 --> 00:09:21.861\nwere falling at just the wrong time,\n\n00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:25.822\nthis made me wonder:\n\n00:09:25.822 --> 00:09:27.917\nCould we match\n\n00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:33.967\nbut just on a much grander scale?\n\n00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:38.420\nLet's call this scheme \"Print Aid.\"\n\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.078\nAnd here's how it might work.\n\n00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:46.235\nProvided it saw little inflation risk from doing so,\n\n00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:48.545\nthe central bank would be mandated\n\n00:09:48.545 --> 00:09:51.938\nto match the government's overseas aid payments\n\n00:09:51.938 --> 00:09:54.405\nup to a certain limit.\n\n00:09:54.405 --> 00:09:56.478\nGovernments have been aiming to get aid\n\n00:09:56.478 --> 00:09:58.196\nto 0.7 percent for years,\n\n00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:01.081\nso let's set the limit at half of that,\n\n00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:05.190\n0.35 percent of their income.\n\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.262\nSo it would work like this: If in a given year\n\n00:10:07.262 --> 00:10:09.948\nthe government gave 0.2 percent of its income\n\n00:10:09.948 --> 00:10:11.080\nto overseas aid,\n\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.563\nthe central bank would simply top it up\n\n00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:15.739\nwith a further 0.2 percent.\n\n00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:19.340\nSo far so good.\n\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.020\nHow risky is this?\n\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.262\nWell, this involves the creation of money\n\n00:10:26.262 --> 00:10:29.070\nto buy goods, not assets.\n\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.623\nIt sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.\n\n00:10:32.623 --> 00:10:37.051\nBut there are two important mitigating factors here.\n\n00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:40.594\nThe first is that by definition,\n\n00:10:40.594 --> 00:10:45.744\nthis money printed would be spent overseas.\n\n00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:49.285\nSo it's not obvious how it leads to inflation\n\n00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:53.694\nin the country doing the actual printing\n\n00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:58.628\nunless it leads to a currency\ndepreciation of that country.\n\n00:10:58.628 --> 00:11:01.921\nThat is unlikely for the second reason:\n\n00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:04.802\nthe scale of the money that would be printed\n\n00:11:04.802 --> 00:11:07.622\nunder this scheme.\n\n00:11:07.622 --> 00:11:10.762\nSo let's think of an example\n\n00:11:10.762 --> 00:11:14.305\nwhere Print Aid was in place\n\n00:11:14.305 --> 00:11:18.647\nin the U.S., U.K. and Japan.\n\n00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:20.950\nTo match the aid payments made\n\n00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.686\nby those governments over the last four years,\n\n00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:25.913\nPrint Aid would have generated\n\n00:11:25.913 --> 00:11:30.248\n200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid.\n\n00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:32.435\nWhat would that look like\n\n00:11:32.435 --> 00:11:36.037\nin the context of the increase in the money stock\n\n00:11:36.037 --> 00:11:38.313\nthat had already happened in those countries\n\n00:11:38.313 --> 00:11:40.394\nto save the financial system?\n\n00:11:40.394 --> 00:11:43.551\nAre you read for this?\n\n00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:45.635\nYou might struggle to see that at the back,\n\n00:11:45.635 --> 00:11:49.205\nbecause the gap is quite small.\n\n00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:51.653\nSo what we're saying here\n\n00:11:51.653 --> 00:11:55.121\nis that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble\n\n00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:57.497\nto save our financial systems,\n\n00:11:57.497 --> 00:11:59.552\nand you know what, it paid off.\n\n00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.125\nThere was no inflation.\n\n00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:05.431\nAre we really saying that it's not worth the risk\n\n00:12:05.431 --> 00:12:10.083\nto print an extra 200 billion for aid?\n\n00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:11.992\nWould the risks really be that different?\n\n00:12:11.992 --> 00:12:14.535\nTo me, it's not that clear.\n\n00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:17.893\nWhat is clear is the impact on aid.\n\n00:12:17.893 --> 00:12:20.009\nEven though this is the printing\n\n00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:21.845\nof just three central banks,\n\n00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:25.466\nthe global aid that's given\n\n00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:30.387\nover this period is up by almost 40 percent.\n\n00:12:30.387 --> 00:12:32.818\nAid as a proportion of national income\n\n00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:36.268\nall of a sudden is at a 40-year high.\n\n00:12:36.268 --> 00:12:39.255\nNow, we don't get to 0.7 percent.\n\n00:12:39.255 --> 00:12:42.000\nGovernments are still incentivized to give.\n\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.493\nBut you know what, that's the \npoint of a matching scheme.\n\n00:12:46.493 --> 00:12:50.308\nSo I think what we've learned\n\n00:12:50.308 --> 00:12:54.902\nis that the risks from this money creation scheme\n\n00:12:54.902 --> 00:12:57.683\nare quite modest,\n\n00:12:57.683 --> 00:13:00.483\nbut the benefits\n\n00:13:00.483 --> 00:13:02.949\nare potentially huge.\n\n00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:06.252\nImagine what we could do\nwith 40 percent more funding.\n\n00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:11.223\nWe might be able to feed the front row.\n\n00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.921\nThe thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear,\n\n00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:15.645\napart from the fact that I've run out of time,\n\n00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:20.362\nis that the window of opportunity for this idea\n\n00:13:20.362 --> 00:13:23.195\nis a short one.\n\n00:13:23.195 --> 00:13:27.020\nToday, money creation by central banks\n\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.934\nis an accepted policy tool.\n\n00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.415\nThat may not always be the case.\n\n00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:36.778\nToday there are universally agreed aims\n\n00:13:36.778 --> 00:13:38.669\nfor international aid.\n\n00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:42.289\nThat may not always be the case.\n\n00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:44.927\nToday might be the only time\n\n00:13:44.927 --> 00:13:47.810\nthat these two things coincide,\n\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.785\nsuch that we can afford the aid\n\n00:13:51.785 --> 00:13:55.428\nthat we've always aspired to give.\n\n00:13:55.428 --> 00:14:03.858\nSo, can we print money for international aid?\n\n00:14:03.858 --> 00:14:07.596\nI seriously believe the question should be,\n\n00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:09.659\nwhy not?\n\n00:14:09.659 --> 00:14:12.472\nThank you very much.\n\n00:14:12.472 --> 00:14:18.156\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What we can learn from galaxies far, far away", "duration": "403", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_lin_what_we_can_learn_from_galaxies_far_far_away", "transcript": "Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies.Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them.And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how  massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems.So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas \u2014 in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot.Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something  very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens  when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception.Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could  possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big.Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it.So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: \"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\" Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these  problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity.So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration \u2014 these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us.

subtract away all of the starlight,\n\n00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:03.783\nwhat I'm left with is this big, blue blob.\n\n00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:05.268\nThis is in false color.\n\n00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:07.617\nIt's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.\n\n00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:10.278\nAnd the question is, if it's not galaxies,\n\n00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:12.477\nwhat is emitting this light?\n\n00:02:12.477 --> 00:02:14.377\nThe answer is hot gas,\n\n00:02:14.377 --> 00:02:16.200\nmillion-degree gas --\n\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.857\nin fact, it's plasma.\n\n00:02:17.857 --> 00:02:19.516\nAnd the reason why it's so hot\n\n00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:21.496\ngoes back to the previous slide.\n\n00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:24.236\nThe extreme gravity of these systems\n\n00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:27.278\nis accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,\n\n00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:29.860\nand great speeds means great temperatures.\n\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.579\nSo this is the main idea,\n\n00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.945\nbut science is a rough draft.\n\n00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.496\nThere are many basic properties about this plasma\n\n00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:38.194\nthat still confuse us,\n\n00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:39.527\nstill puzzle us,\n\n00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:41.613\nand still push our understanding\n\n00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:43.652\nof the physics of the very hot.\n\n00:02:43.652 --> 00:02:47.079\nThird thing: probing the very small.\n\n00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.925\nNow, to explain this, I need to tell you\n\n00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:51.945\na very disturbing fact.\n\n00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:54.735\nMost of the universe's matter\n\n00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:56.546\nis not made up of atoms.\n\n00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:58.496\nYou were lied to.\n\n00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:01.623\nMost of it is made up of something \nvery, very mysterious,\n\n00:03:01.623 --> 00:03:03.745\nwhich we call dark matter.\n\n00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:07.412\nDark matter is something that \ndoesn't like to interact very much,\n\n00:03:07.412 --> 00:03:09.080\nexcept through gravity,\n\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.692\nand of course we would like to learn more about it.\n\n00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.235\nIf you're a particle physicist,\n\n00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:14.744\nyou want to know what happens \nwhen we smash things together.\n\n00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:16.734\nAnd dark matter is no exception.\n\n00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.394\nWell, how do we do this?\n\n00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:19.885\nTo answer that question,\n\n00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:21.278\nI'm going to have to ask another one,\n\n00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:24.444\nwhich is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?\n\n00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:26.754\nHere is an image.\n\n00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:29.945\nSince galaxy clusters are representative\n\n00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:33.069\nslices of the universe, scaled-down versions.\n\n00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.192\nThey are mostly made up of dark matter,\n\n00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:37.745\nand that's what you see in this bluish purple.\n\n00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:39.362\nThe red represents the hot gas,\n\n00:03:39.362 --> 00:03:41.329\nand, of course, you can see many galaxies.\n\n00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.694\nWhat's happened is a particle accelerator\n\n00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:45.585\nat a huge, huge scale.\n\n00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:47.362\nAnd this is very important,\n\n00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:49.245\nbecause what it means is that very, very small\n\n00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:52.329\neffects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,\n\n00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.508\nmight be compounded and compounded\n\n00:03:54.508 --> 00:03:58.317\ninto something that we could \npossibly observe in nature.\n\n00:03:58.317 --> 00:03:59.829\nSo, it's very funny.\n\n00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.777\nThe reason why galaxy clusters\n\n00:04:01.777 --> 00:04:03.443\ncan teach us about dark matter,\n\n00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:05.193\nthe reason why galaxy clusters\n\n00:04:05.193 --> 00:04:07.746\ncan teach us about the physics of the very small,\n\n00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.777\nis precisely because they are so very big.\n\n00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:14.862\nFourth thing: the physics of the very strange.\n\n00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:17.912\nCertainly what I've said so far is crazy.\n\n00:04:17.912 --> 00:04:20.195\nOkay, if there's anything stranger\n\n00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:22.612\nI think it has to be dark energy.\n\n00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:24.329\nIf I throw a ball into the air,\n\n00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:26.127\nI expect it to go up.\n\n00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:28.251\nWhat I don't expect is that it go up\n\n00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:30.417\nat an ever-increasing rate.\n\n00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.162\nSimilarly, cosmologists understand why\n\n00:04:33.162 --> 00:04:34.744\nthe universe is expanding.\n\n00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:36.912\nThey don't understand why it's expanding\n\n00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:38.850\nat an ever-increasing rate.\n\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.528\nThey give the cause of this\n\n00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:42.120\naccelerated expansion a name,\n\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.004\nand they call it dark energy.\n\n00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:46.692\nAnd, again, we want to learn more about it.\n\n00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:49.079\nSo, one particular question that we have is,\n\n00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:51.774\nhow does dark energy affect the universe\n\n00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:53.392\nat the largest scales?\n\n00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:54.851\nDepending on how strong it is,\n\n00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:58.112\nmaybe structure forms faster or slower.\n\n00:04:58.112 --> 00:05:00.661\nWell, the problem with the large-scale structure\n\n00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:02.999\nof the universe is that it's horribly complicated.\n\n00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.328\nHere is a computer simulation.\n\n00:05:05.328 --> 00:05:07.456\nAnd we need a way to simplify it.\n\n00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:11.027\nWell, I like to think about this using an analogy.\n\n00:05:11.027 --> 00:05:13.745\nIf I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,\n\n00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:15.411\nthe most important thing to do\n\n00:05:15.411 --> 00:05:17.192\nis not to model the little positions\n\n00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.113\nof every single little piece of the boat that broke off.\n\n00:05:20.113 --> 00:05:21.778\nThe most important thing to do is\n\n00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:23.779\nto track the two biggest parts.\n\n00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.611\nSimilarly, I can learn a lot about the universe\n\n00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:29.078\nat the largest scales\n\n00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.829\nby tracking its biggest pieces\n\n00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:34.820\nand those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.\n\n00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.776\nSo, as I come to a close,\n\n00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.778\nyou might feel slightly cheated.\n\n00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:42.028\nI mean, I began by talking about\n\n00:05:42.028 --> 00:05:44.111\nhow galaxy clusters are useful,\n\n00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.611\nand I've given some reasons,\n\n00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.211\nbut what is their use really?\n\n00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:50.328\nWell, to answer this,\n\n00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:52.944\nI want to give you a quote by Henry Ford\n\n00:05:52.944 --> 00:05:54.430\nwhen he was asked about cars.\n\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.789\nHe had this to say:\n\n00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.078\n\"If I had asked people what they wanted,\n\n00:05:58.078 --> 00:06:00.861\nthey would have said faster horses.\"\n\n00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.362\nToday, we as a society are faced\n\n00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.580\nwith many, many difficult problems.\n\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.411\nAnd the solutions to these \nproblems are not obvious.\n\n00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.578\nThey are not faster horses.\n\n00:06:11.578 --> 00:06:13.820\nThey will require an enormous amount of\n\n00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.526\nscientific ingenuity.\n\n00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:17.112\nSo, yes, we need to focus,\n\n00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:18.862\nyes, we need to concentrate,\n\n00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:20.828\nbut we also need to remember that\n\n00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:23.663\ninnovation, ingenuity, inspiration --\n\n00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:24.995\nthese things come\n\n00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:26.683\nwhen we broaden our field of vision\n\n00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:28.023\nwhen we step back\n\n00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:29.372\nwhen we zoom out.\n\n00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:31.195\nAnd I can't think of a better way to do this than\n\n00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:34.950\nby studying the universe around us. Thanks.\n\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.899\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The 3 agencies with the power to make or break economies", "duration": "589", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/annette_heuser_the_3_agencies_with_the_power_to_make_or_break_economies", "transcript": "Almost two years ago, I was driving in my car in Germany, and I turned on the radio. Europe at the time was in the middle of the Euro crisis, and all the headlines were about European countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the United States. I listened and thought to myself, \"What are these rating agencies, and why is everybody so upset about their work?\"Well, if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years to trying to reform them, obviously I would have called you crazy. But guess what's really crazy: the way these rating agencies are run. And I would like to explain to you not only why it's time to change this, but also how we can do it.So let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do. As you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get, investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money. A rating can range from a so-called AAA, which means it's a top-performing product, and it can go down to the level of the so-called BBB-, which means it's a fairly risky investment. Rating agencies are rating companies. They are rating banks. They are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities. But they can also rate countries, and these ratings are called sovereign ratings, and I would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings.And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now, you're thinking, so why should I really care about this, right? Be honest. Well, ratings affect you. They affect all of us. If a rating agency rates a country, it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt. So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency, the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets. So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer, because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow. But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive? Well, then the country has less available for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare. And this is the reason why you should care, because sovereign ratings affect everyone. And that is the reason why I believe they should be defined as public goods. They should be transparent, accessible, and available to everyone at no cost.But here's the situation: the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only \u2014 Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch \u2014 and we know whenever there is a market concentration, there is really no competition. There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product. And let's face it, the credit rating  agencies have contributed, putting the global economy on the brink, and yet they have to change the way they operate.The second point, would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer? Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible. But that's actually what's going on in the rating agency sector every single day. The customers of these rating agencies, like countries or companies, they are paying for their own ratings, and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest.The third point is, the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings, but in this day and age, you can't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that's inside. But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy, we really do not know what all the different ingredients are. We are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work, and we need to change this.I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul, not just a trimming at the margins. I think it's time for a bold move. I think it's time to upgrade the system. And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector. And we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk, and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.INCRA would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix. It would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment. The endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation, to run the rating agency, and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available. But this is not enough to make a difference, right? INCRA would also be based on a very, very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest, and it would include many stakeholders from society. INCRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency, it would be a truly international one, in which, in particular, the emerging economies would have an equal interest,  voice and representation.The second big difference that INCRA would make is that would it base its sovereign risk assessment on a broader set of indicators. Think about it that way. If we conduct a sovereign rating, we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country, its macroeconomic fundamentals. But we also have to ask the question, who is cultivating the economic soil of a country, right? Well, a country has many gardeners, and one of them is the government, so we have to ask the question, how is a country governed? How is it managed? And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators. These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country. I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest  in renewable energy and education. It's important for you to know if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis, if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it's promised. For example, if INCRA would rate South Africa right now, of course we would take a very, very close look at the youth unemployment of the country, the highest in the world. If over 70 percent of a country's population under the age of 35 is unemployed, of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future. Well, our friends at Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well. But guess what? We do not know exactly how they will take this into account.And this leads me to the third big difference that INCRA would make. INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology.So in contrast to the current system, INCRA would be fully transparent. So in a nutshell, INCRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition, it would increase the transparency of the sector, and it would also increase the quality.I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world, but I tell you it's a very important one, and a very important one to fix, because sovereign ratings affect all of us, and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods. And this is why we are testing our model right now, and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INCRA to life. I truly believe building up INCRA is in everyone's interest, and that we have the unique opportunity right now to turn INCRA into a cornerstone of a new, more inclusive financial system. Because for way too long, we have left the big financial players on their own. It's time to give them some company.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1937, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:14.390\nAlmost two years

00:01:27.930\nthey are investing their money.\n\n00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.741\nA rating can range from a so-called AAA,\n\n00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:33.684\nwhich means it's a top-performing product,\n\n00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:36.211\nand it can go down to the level\n\n00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.225\nof the so-called BBB-,\n\n00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:42.650\nwhich means it's a fairly risky investment.\n\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.211\nRating agencies are rating companies.\n\n00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.461\nThey are rating banks.\n\n00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:48.825\nThey are rating even financial products\n\n00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.900\nlike the infamous mortgage-backed securities.\n\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.977\nBut they can also rate countries,\n\n00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:56.725\nand these ratings are called sovereign ratings,\n\n00:01:56.725 --> 00:01:59.082\nand I would like to focus in particular\n\n00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:01.708\non these sovereign ratings.\n\n00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:04.114\nAnd I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,\n\n00:02:04.114 --> 00:02:05.573\nyou're thinking,\n\n00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:08.181\nso why should I really care about this, right?\n\n00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:09.766\nBe honest.\n\n00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:12.055\nWell, ratings affect you.\n\n00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:14.217\nThey affect all of us.\n\n00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.522\nIf a rating agency rates a country,\n\n00:02:17.522 --> 00:02:20.797\nit basically assesses and evaluates\n\n00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:22.198\na country's debt\n\n00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:24.547\nand the ability and willingness of a country\n\n00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:26.888\nto repay its debt.\n\n00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:29.821\nSo if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,\n\n00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:31.898\nthe country has to pay more\n\n00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:33.505\nin order to borrow money\n\n00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:35.066\non the international markets.\n\n00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.867\nSo it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,\n\n00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:40.230\nbecause you and your fellow countrymen\n\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.020\nhave to pony up more in order to borrow.\n\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.836\nBut what if a country can't afford to pay more\n\n00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:49.673\nbecause it's maybe too expensive?\n\n00:02:49.673 --> 00:02:52.608\nWell, then the country has less available\n\n00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:56.270\nfor other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.\n\n00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.709\nAnd this is the reason why you should care,\n\n00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.755\nbecause sovereign ratings affect everyone.\n\n00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.416\nAnd that is the reason why I believe\n\n00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:06.372\nthey should be defined as public goods.\n\n00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:09.183\nThey should be transparent, accessible,\n\n00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:13.765\nand available to everyone at no cost.\n\n00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:15.811\nBut here's the situation:\n\n00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.955\nthe rating agency market is dominated\n\n00:03:17.955 --> 00:03:20.928\nby three players and three players only --\n\n00:03:20.928 --> 00:03:23.707\nStandard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch --\n\n00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:26.664\nand we know whenever there\nis a market concentration,\n\n00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:28.463\nthere is really no competition.\n\n00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:30.740\nThere is no incentive to improve\n\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.057\nthe quality of your product.\n\n00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:37.306\nAnd let's face it, the credit rating \nagencies have contributed,\n\n00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:40.151\nputting the global economy on the brink,\n\n00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:43.936\nand yet they have to change the way they operate.\n\n00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.809\nThe second point,\n\n00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.831\nwould you really buy a car\n\n00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.317\njust based on the advice of the dealer?\n\n00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:54.330\nObviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.\n\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.923\nBut that's actually what's going on\n\n00:03:56.923 --> 00:04:00.801\nin the rating agency sector every single day.\n\n00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:03.550\nThe customers of these rating agencies,\n\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.037\nlike countries or companies,\n\n00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.463\nthey are paying for their own ratings,\n\n00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:10.461\nand obviously this is creating\n\n00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:13.332\na conflict of interest.\n\n00:04:13.332 --> 00:04:15.848\nThe third point is,\n\n00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:18.763\nthe rating agencies are not really telling us\n\n00:04:18.763 --> 00:04:21.401\nhow they are coming up with their ratings,\n\n00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:23.241\nbut in this day and age,\n\n00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:25.117\nyou can't even sell a candy bar\n\n00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:28.165\nwithout listing everything that's inside.\n\n00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:31.849\nBut for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,\n\n00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.518\nwe really do not know\n\n00:04:33.518 --> 00:04:36.000\nwhat all the different ingredients are.\n\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.946\nWe are allowing the rating agencies\n\n00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:40.648\nto be intransparent about their work,\n\n00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:42.710\nand we need to change this.\n\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.190\nI think there is no doubt that the sector\n\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.907\nneeds a complete overhaul,\n\n00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:49.417\nnot just a trimming at the margins.\n\n00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:51.640\nI think it's time for a bold move.\n\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.756\nI think it's time to upgrade the system.\n\n00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:57.318\nAnd this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation\n\n00:04:57.318 --> 00:05:00.140\nhave invested a lot of time and effort\n\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.871\nthinking about an alternative for the sector.\n\n00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:06.470\nAnd we have developed the first model\n\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.628\nfor a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,\n\n00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:16.084\nand we call it by its acronym, INCRA.\n\n00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.482\nINCRA would make a difference\n\n00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:19.909\nto the current system\n\n00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.111\nby adding another nonprofit player to the mix.\n\n00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:27.560\nIt would be based on a nonprofit model\n\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.204\nthat would be based on a sustainable endowment.\n\n00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:33.328\nThe endowment would create income\n\n00:05:33.328 --> 00:05:35.745\nthat would allow us to run the operation,\n\n00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:37.447\nto run the rating agency,\n\n00:05:37.447 --> 00:05:39.497\nand it would also allow us\n\n00:05:39.497 --> 00:05:43.182\nto make our ratings publicly available.\n\n00:05:43.182 --> 00:05:45.885\nBut this is not enough to make a difference, right?\n\n00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:47.758\nINCRA would also be based on\n\n00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:50.336\na very, very clear governance structure\n\n00:05:50.336 --> 00:05:53.258\nthat would avoid any conflict of interest,\n\n00:05:53.258 --> 00:05:58.127\nand it would include many stakeholders from society.\n\n00:05:58.127 --> 00:06:00.676\nINCRA would not only be a European\n\n00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:02.807\nor an American rating agency,\n\n00:06:02.807 --> 00:06:05.171\nit would be a truly international one,\n\n00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:08.288\nin which, in particular, the emerging economies\n\n00:06:08.288 --> 00:06:13.412\nwould have an equal interest, \nvoice and representation.\n\n00:06:13.412 --> 00:06:16.842\nThe second big difference that INCRA would make is\n\n00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:19.820\nthat would it base its sovereign risk assessment\n\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.516\non a broader set of indicators.\n\n00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.417\nThink about it that way.\n\n00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.261\nIf we conduct a sovereign rating,\n\n00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.878\nwe basically take a look at\n\n00:06:27.878 --> 00:06:30.545\nthe economic soil of a country,\n\n00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:33.130\nits macroeconomic fundamentals.\n\n00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.308\nBut we also have to ask the question,\n\n00:06:35.308 --> 00:06:38.209\nwho is cultivating the economic soil\n\n00:06:38.224 --> 00:06:40.144\nof a country, right?\n\n00:06:40.144 --> 00:06:42.304\nWell, a country has many gardeners,\n\n00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:44.122\nand one of them is the government,\n\n00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:46.167\nso we have to ask the question,\n\n00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:47.481\nhow is a country governed?\n\n00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.067\nHow is it managed?\n\n00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:51.237\nAnd this is the reason why we have developed\n\n00:06:51.237 --> 00:06:54.328\nwhat we call forward-looking indicators.\n\n00:06:54.328 --> 00:06:55.995\nThese are indicators that give you\n\n00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:57.502\na much better read about\n\n00:06:57.502 --> 00:07:01.053\nthe socioeconomic development of a country.\n\n00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:03.811\nI hope you would agree it's important for you to know\n\n00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:10.979\nif your government is willing to invest \nin renewable energy and education.\n\n00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:12.717\nIt's important for you to know\n\n00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:14.720\nif the government of your country\n\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.682\nis able to manage a crisis,\n\n00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:19.663\nif the government is finally able to implement\n\n00:07:19.663 --> 00:07:23.391\nthe reforms that it's promised.\n\n00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:25.258\nFor example, if INCRA would rate\n\n00:07:25.258 --> 00:07:27.212\nSouth Africa right now,\n\n00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.669\nof course we would take a very, very close look\n\n00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:32.969\nat the youth unemployment of the country,\n\n00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:35.507\nthe highest in the world.\n\n00:07:35.507 --> 00:07:38.951\nIf over 70 percent of a country's population\n\n00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.542\nunder the age of 35 is unemployed,\n\n00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:45.638\nof course this has a huge impact on the economy\n\n00:07:45.638 --> 00:07:49.932\ntoday and even more so in the future.\n\n00:07:49.932 --> 00:07:52.207\nWell, our friends at Moody's,\n\n00:07:52.207 --> 00:07:54.530\nStandard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch will tell us\n\n00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.563\nwe would take this into account as well.\n\n00:07:57.563 --> 00:07:59.512\nBut guess what? We do not know\n\n00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:02.529\nexactly how they will take this into account.\n\n00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:04.880\nAnd this leads me to the third big difference\n\n00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.584\nthat INCRA would make.\n\n00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:09.378\nINCRA would not only release its ratings\n\n00:08:09.378 --> 00:08:12.349\nbut it would also release its indicators\n\n00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:14.011\nand methodology.\n\n00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:16.574\nSo in contrast to the current system,\n\n00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:20.089\nINCRA would be fully transparent.\n\n00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:21.928\nSo in a nutshell,\n\n00:08:21.928 --> 00:08:24.130\nINCRA would offer an alternative\n\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.556\nto the current system of\nthe big three rating agencies\n\n00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:31.521\nby adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix\n\n00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:33.925\nthat would increase the competition,\n\n00:08:33.925 --> 00:08:36.488\nit would increase the transparency of the sector,\n\n00:08:36.488 --> 00:08:39.293\nand it would also increase the quality.\n\n00:08:39.293 --> 00:08:41.261\nI can tell that sovereign ratings\n\n00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:44.485\nmay still look to you like this very small piece\n\n00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:48.760\nof this very complex global financial world,\n\n00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.200\nbut I tell you it's a very important one,\n\n00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.642\nand a very important one to fix,\n\n00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:56.785\nbecause sovereign ratings affect all of us,\n\n00:08:56.785 --> 00:09:00.323\nand they should be addressed and should be defined\n\n00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:01.783\nas public goods.\n\n00:09:01.783 --> 00:09:04.667\nAnd this is why we are testing our model right now,\n\n00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:07.594\nand why we are trying to find out if it can\n\n00:09:07.594 --> 00:09:10.797\nbring together a group of able and willing actors\n\n00:09:10.797 --> 00:09:13.447\nto bring INCRA to life.\n\n00:09:13.447 --> 00:09:16.058\nI truly believe building up INCRA\n\n00:09:16.058 --> 00:09:18.449\nis in everyone's interest,\n\n00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:22.019\nand that we have the unique opportunity right now\n\n00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:24.588\nto turn INCRA into a cornerstone\n\n00:09:24.588 --> 00:09:28.983\nof a new, more inclusive financial system.\n\n00:09:28.983 --> 00:09:31.551\nBecause for way too long,\n\n00:09:31.551 --> 00:09:35.243\nwe have left the big financial players on their own.\n\n00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:38.039\nIt's time to give them some company.\n\n00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:40.073\nThank you.\n\n00:09:40.073 --> 00:09:44.073\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Could future devices read images from our brains?", "duration": "626", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_lou_jepsen_could_future_devices_read_images_from_our_brains", "transcript": "I had brain surgery 18 years ago, and since that time, brain science has become a personal passion of mine. I'm actually an engineer. And first let me say, I recently joined Google's Moonshot group, where I had a division, the display division in Google X, and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google.So that said, there's a stigma when you have brain surgery. Are you still smart or not? And if not, can you make yourself smart again?After my neurosurgery, part of my brain was missing, and I had to deal with that. It wasn't the grey matter, but it  was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters. Immediately after my surgery, I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day, because if I just took nothing, I would die within hours. Every day now for 18 years \u2014 every single day \u2014 I've had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals, and try to get them, to stay alive. There have been several close calls.But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart, so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's detailed. I began to try different mixtures, and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self, my sense of who I was, my thinking, my behavior towards people. One particularly dramatic case: for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s, and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed. (Laughter) I was angry all the time, I thought about sex constantly, and I thought I was the smartest person in the entire world, and \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that, or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that. I was kind of extreme. But to me, the surprise was, I wasn't trying to be arrogant. I was actually trying, with a little bit of insecurity, to actually fix a problem in front of me, and it just didn't come out that way.So I couldn't handle it. I changed my dosages. But that experience, I think, gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through, and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then.What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery, my creative thought, my idea flow. And I think mostly in images, and so for me that became a key metric \u2014 how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping, if you will, my ideas, trying on different new ideas for size, playing out scenarios. This kind of thinking isn't new. Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes saw things similarly. They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing. There are those today that dispute that, and lots of debates about how the mind works, but for me it's simple: Mental images, for most of us, are central in inventive and creative thinking.So after several years, I tuned myself up and I have lots of great, really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them. And so now I'm working on, how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster? Can you imagine, if you will, a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her? Or a musician to get the music out of his head? There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed. And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.So let me show you why I think  we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups. Both used fMRI technology \u2014 functional magnetic resonance imaging technology \u2014 to image the brain, and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard. And the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image. The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining, seeing that same image. And the right column was created by subtracting the middle  column from the left column, showing the difference to be nearly zero. This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result. The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing.Next let me share with you one other experiment, this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley. They've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields. So let me set this up for you. In this experiment, individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences. Then a new movie was shown with new images, new people, new animals in it, and a new scan set was recorded. The computer, using brain scan data alone, decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the  individual was actually seeing. On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess, and on the left-hand side, the presented clip. This is the jaw-dropper. We are so close to being able to do this. We just need to up the resolution. And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image, it creates the same brain scan.So this was done with the highest-resolution brain scan systems available today, and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years. Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse. How do we do that? There's a lot of techniques in this approach. One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes. I'm not for that. There's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed, some even by me, but given the recent success of MRI, first we need to ask the question, is it the end of the road with this technology? Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements, not the thousandfold we need. I'm putting forward an idea: instead of bigger magnets, let's make better magnets. There's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets, and with these magnets, we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain, and using those, we can actually create holographic-like interference structures to get precision control over many patterns, as is shown here by shifting things. We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrangements, kind of like making Spirograph.So why does that matter? A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big, really huge magnets, right? But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems. Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field, put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies. So by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan. And on top of that, we can then layer our ever-growing knowledge  of brain structure and memory to create a thousandfold increase that we need. And using fMRI, we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow, but the hormones and neurotransmitters  I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity, which is the dream.We're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media. Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought? What would we be capable of then? And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought? You think the Internet was big. These are huge questions. It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills. And indeed, this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.We have little option but to open this door. Regardless, pick a year \u2014 will it happen in five years or 15 years? It's hard to imagine it taking much longer. We need to learn how to take this step together.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1939, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:15.073\nI had brain surgery 18 years ago,\n\n00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:17.640\nand since that time, brain science has become\n\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.639\na personal passion of mine.\n\n00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:21.874\nI'm actually an engineer.\n\n00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:24.390\nAnd first let me say, I recently joined\n\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.939\nGoogle's Moonshot group,\n\n00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.151\nwhere I had a division,\n\n00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:29.332\nthe display division in Google X,\n\n00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:31.954\nand the brain science work I'm speaking about today\n\n00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:34.875\nis work I did before I joined Google\n\n00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:37.207\nand on the side outside of Google.\n\n00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:40.390\nSo that said, there's a stigma\n\n00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.675\nwhen you have brain surgery.\n\n00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.498\nAre you still smart or not?\n\n00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:49.346\nAnd if not, can you make yourself smart again?\n\n00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:51.112\nAfter my neurosurgery,\n\n00:00:51.112 --> 00:00:53.109\npart of my brain was missing,\n\n00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.882\nand I had to deal with that.\n\n00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:58.826\nIt wasn't the grey matter, but it \nwas the gooey part dead center\n\n00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:02.228\nthat makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.\n\n00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.459\nImmediately after my surgery,\n\n00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.602\nI had to decide what amounts of each of over\n\n00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:10.304\na dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,\n\n00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.113\nbecause if I just took nothing,\n\n00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:14.845\nI would die within hours.\n\n00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:18.765\nEvery day now for 18 years -- every single day --\n\n00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:21.475\nI've had to try to decide the combinations\n\n00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:22.803\nand mixtures of chemicals,\n\n00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:26.650\nand try to get them, to stay alive.\n\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.371\nThere have been several close calls.\n\n00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:33.070\nBut luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,\n\n00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.297\nso I decided I would experiment\n\n00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:38.737\nto try to find more optimal dosages\n\n00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:40.374\nbecause there really isn't a clear road map\n\n00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:42.277\non this that's detailed.\n\n00:01:42.277 --> 00:01:44.428\nI began to try different

case:\n\n00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.847\nfor a couple months I actually tried dosages\n\n00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:04.755\nand chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,\n\n00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:07.766\nand I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.\n\n00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:10.886\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:13.944\nI was angry all the time,\n\n00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:15.790\nI thought about sex constantly,\n\n00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.739\nand I thought I was the smartest person\n\n00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.790\nin the entire world, and\n\n00:02:20.790 -->

of that.\n\n00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:30.429\nI was kind of extreme.\n\n00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.998\nBut to me, the surprise was,\n\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:35.164\nI wasn't trying to be

proposed, some even by me,\n\n00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.958\nbut given the recent success of MRI,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.026\nfirst we need to ask the question,\n\n00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:17.867\nis it the end of the road with this technology?\n\n00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:20.322\nConventional wisdom says the only way\n\n00:07:20.322 --> 00:07:22.911\nto get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,\n\n00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:24.753\nbut at this point bigger magnets\n\n00:07:24.753 --> 00:07:28.503\nonly offer incremental resolution improvements,\n\n00:07:28.503 --> 00:07:30.663\nnot the thousandfold we need.\n\n00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:32.486\nI'm putting forward an idea:\n\n00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:34.449\ninstead of bigger magnets,\n\n00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.899\nlet's make better magnets.\n\n00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:38.902\nThere's some new technology breakthroughs\n\n00:07:38.902 --> 00:07:40.359\nin nanoscience\n\n00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.086\nwhen applied to magnetic structures\n\n00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:45.099\nthat have created a whole new class of magnets,\n\n00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.630\nand with these magnets, we can lay down\n\n00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.797\nvery fine detailed magnetic field patterns\n\n00:07:49.797 --> 00:07:51.152\nthroughout the brain,\n\n00:07:51.152 --> 00:07:54.334\nand using those, we can actually create\n\n00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:57.172\nholographic-like interference structures\n\n00:07:57.172 --> 00:08:00.641\nto get precision control over many patterns,\n\n00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:03.086\nas is shown here by shifting things.\n\n00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:06.236\nWe can create much more complicated structures\n\n00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.307\nwith slightly different arrangements,\n\n00:08:08.307 --> 00:08:11.340\nkind of like making Spirograph.\n\n00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.568\nSo why does that matter?\n\n00:08:13.568 --> 00:08:16.145\nA lot of effort in MRI over the years\n\n00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:18.982\nhas gone into making really big,\n\n00:08:18.982 --> 00:08:21.592\nreally huge magnets, right?\n\n00:08:21.592 --> 00:08:24.101\nBut yet most of the recent advances\n\n00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:26.298\nin resolution have actually come from\n\n00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:30.306\ningeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions\n\n00:08:30.306 --> 00:08:33.593\nin the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers\n\n00:08:33.593 --> 00:08:36.284\nin the MRI systems.\n\n00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:39.606\nLet's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,\n\n00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:42.278\nput down structured magnetic patterns\n\n00:08:42.278 --> 00:08:45.377\nin addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.\n\n00:08:45.377 --> 00:08:47.684\nSo by combining the magnetics patterns\n\n00:08:47.684 --> 00:08:50.394\nwith the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies\n\n00:08:50.394 --> 00:08:52.565\nprocessing which can massively increase\n\n00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.534\nthe information that we can extract\n\n00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.980\nin a single scan.\n\n00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.312\nAnd on top of that, we can then layer\n\n00:08:59.312 --> 00:09:03.784\nour ever-growing knowledge \nof brain structure and memory\n\n00:09:03.784 --> 00:09:07.479\nto create a thousandfold increase that we need.\n\n00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.422\nAnd using fMRI, we should be able to measure\n\n00:09:10.422 --> 00:09:12.504\nnot just oxygenated blood flow,\n\n00:09:12.504 --> 00:09:15.405\nbut the hormones and neurotransmitters \nI've talked about\n\n00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:17.750\nand maybe even the direct neural activity,\n\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.253\nwhich is the dream.\n\n00:09:19.253 --> 00:09:21.487\nWe're going to be able to dump our ideas\n\n00:09:21.487 --> 00:09:24.181\ndirectly to digital media.\n\n00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:26.892\nCould you imagine if we could leapfrog language\n\n00:09:26.892 --> 00:09:31.101\nand communicate directly with human thought?\n\n00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:34.294\nWhat would we be capable of then?\n\n00:09:34.294 --> 00:09:36.931\nAnd how will we learn to deal\n\n00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:41.150\nwith the truths of unfiltered human thought?\n\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.717\nYou think the Internet was big.\n\n00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:46.319\nThese are huge

00:09:54.366\nAnd indeed, this very same tool\n\n00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:56.492\nmay prove to lead to the cure\n\n00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:59.566\nfor Alzheimer's and similar diseases.\n\n00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:03.078\nWe have little option but to open this door.\n\n00:10:03.078 --> 00:10:04.663\nRegardless, pick a year --\n\n00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:06.929\nwill it happen in five years or 15

We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought, perhaps rather timeless. I'm going to argue that, in fact, business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology, that those assumptions are changing, and, in fact, changing quite dramatically, and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy.Let me start, if I may, with a little bit of history. The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants: Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG, and Michael Porter, professor at the Harvard Business School. Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns \u2014 scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world.Porter agreed with that premise, but he qualified it. He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well, but businesses actually have multiple steps to them. They have different components, and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy. A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others. He formed the concept of the value chain, essentially the sequence of steps with which a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component, becomes assembled into a finished product, and then is distributed, for example, and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components, and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts. And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs, that in essence you need to coordinate, organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets, very often, and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs. It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected.Now what I'm going to argue is that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated. First of all, let's think about transaction costs. There are really two components to transaction costs. One is about processing information, and the other is about communication. These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time. As we all know from so many contexts, they have been radically transformed since the days when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories. In particular, since the mid-'90s, communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs, which is why communication, the Internet, has exploded in such a dramatic fashion. Now, those falling transaction costs have profound consequences, because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together, and they are falling, there is less to economize on. There is less need for vertically integrated organization, and value chains at least can break up. They needn't necessarily, but they can. In particular, it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another.That is not just an abstract proposition. There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened. A poster child example was the encyclopedia business. The encyclopedia business in the days of leatherbound books was basically a distribution business. Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen. The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along, new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper, and the encyclopedia industry collapsed. It's now, of course, a very familiar story. This, in fact, more generally was the story of the first generation of the Internet economy. It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation, or what we call deconstruction.One of the questions I was occasionally asked was, well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia when Britannica no longer has a business model? And it was a while before the answer became manifest. Now, of course, we know what it is: it's the Wikipedia. Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution. What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced. The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia created by its users. And this, in fact, defines what you might call the second decade of the Internet economy, the decade in which the Internet as a noun became the Internet as a verb. It became a set of conversations, the era in which user-generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon. Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale. It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job, and certainly a much cheaper job, than professionals in a hierarchical organization. So basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented, as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed.But there's another question that obviously this graph poses, which is, okay, we've gone through two decades \u2014 does anything distinguish the third? And what I'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third, and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter-Henderson logic that we've been talking about. And that is, about data. If we go back to around 2000, a lot of people were talking about the information revolution, and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data was growing, indeed growing quite fast. but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog. We go forward to 2007, not only had the world's stock of data exploded, but there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog. And more important even than that, if you look more carefully at this graph, what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an I.P. address. It's on a server or it's on a P.C. But having an I.P. address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an I.P. address. It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to see patterns, an entirely new thing. If we run the numbers forward to today, it probably looks something like this. We're not really sure. If we run the numbers forward to 2020, we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC. It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present. And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected via an I.P. address. Now, if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points, a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten-thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data, this just in the last 10 or 11 years. This, I would submit, is a sea change, a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in.The first human genome, that of James Watson, was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year 2000, and it took about 200 million dollars and about 10 years of work to map just one person's genomic makeup. Since then, the costs of mapping the genome have come down. In fact, they've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed, to the point where the cost  is now below 1,000 dollars, and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015 it will be below 100 dollars \u2014 a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a 15-year period, an extraordinary phenomenon. Now, in the days when mapping a genome cost millions, or even tens of thousands, it was basically a research enterprise. Scientists would gather some representative people, and they would see patterns, and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals. But when the genome can  be mapped for 100 bucks, 99 dollars while you wait, then what happens is, it becomes retail. It becomes above all clinical. You go the doctor with a cold, and if he or she hasn't done it already, the first thing they do is map your genome, at which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract  knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you, but they're starting from your particular genome. Now think of the power of that. Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting. Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before. This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while, but this will drive a revolution in medicine. Fabulous, lots of people talk about this.But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention. How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today? If your business is based on proprietary data, if your competitive advantage is defined by your data, how on Earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the value that's implicit in the technology? They can't.So essentially what's happening here, and genomics is merely one example of this, is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it, and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated. The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate. The polarization of scale economies towards the very small \u2014 small is beautiful \u2014 allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production. The scaling in the opposite direction, towards things like big data, drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve that scale. But either way, the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal.The logic isn't just about big data. If we were to look, for example, at the telecommunications industry, you can tell the same story about fiber optics. If we look at the pharmaceutical industry, or, for that matter, university research, you can say exactly the same story about so-called \"big science.\" And in the opposite direction, if we look, say, at the energy sector, where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy, that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon. That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale.Either way, what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries, and that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy. It means, for example, that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure, where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy, not something that the strategy presupposes. It means, for example, we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. Think about the genome. We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously. And we need industry structures that will accommodate very, very different motivations, from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments, or, for that matter, cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing, because that is the only way that they can get to scale.These kinds of transformations render the traditional premises  of business strategy obsolete. They drive us into a completely new world. They require us, whether we are in the public sector or the private sector, to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business, and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1938, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:14.607\nI'm going to talk a little bit about

or the average\n\n00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:25.702\nof that of its parts.\n\n00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:28.279\nAnd this idea of the value chain was predicated\n\n00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.847\non the recognition that\n\n00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:34.493\nwhat holds a business together is transaction costs,\n\n00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:36.788\nthat in essence you need to coordinate,\n\n00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:39.363\norganizations are more efficient at coordination\n\n00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.025\nthan markets, very often,\n\n00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:44.081\nand therefore the nature and role and boundaries\n\n00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:47.920\nof the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.\n\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.484\nIt was on those two ideas,\n\n00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:53.870\nHenderson's idea of increasing returns\n\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.418\nto scale and experience,\n\n00:02:55.418 --> 00:02:57.841\nand Porter's idea of the value chain,\n\n00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:59.754\nencompassing heterogenous elements,\n\n00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:03.089\nthat the whole edifice of business strategy\n\n00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.866\nwas subsequently erected.\n\n00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:08.295\nNow what I'm going to argue is\n\n00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:14.009\nthat those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.\n\n00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.563\nFirst of all, let's think about transaction costs.\n\n00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.960\nThere are really two components\nto transaction costs.\n\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.830\nOne is about processing information,\nand the other is about communication.\n\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.111\nThese are the economics of\nprocessing and communicating\n\n00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:27.585\nas they have evolved over a long period of time.\n\n00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:30.595\nAs we all know from so many contexts,\n\n00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:32.851\nthey have been radically transformed\n\n00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:35.163\nsince the days when Porter and Henderson\n\n00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.257\nfirst formulated their theories.\n\n00:03:37.257 --> 00:03:39.323\nIn particular, since the mid-'90s,\n\n00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:41.191\ncommunications costs have actually been falling\n\n00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:43.182\neven faster than transaction costs,\n\n00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:45.741\nwhich is why communication, the Internet,\n\n00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:50.356\nhas exploded in such a dramatic fashion.\n\n00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:52.526\nNow, those falling transaction costs\n\n00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:54.502\nhave profound consequences,\n\n00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:56.295\nbecause if transaction costs are the glue\n\n00:03:56.295 --> 00:03:58.717\nthat hold value chains together, and they are falling,\n\n00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:00.359\nthere is less to economize on.\n\n00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.291\nThere is less need for vertically\nintegrated organization,\n\n00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.169\nand value chains at least can break up.\n\n00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.668\nThey needn't necessarily, but they can.\n\n00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:10.808\nIn particular, it then becomes possible for\n\n00:04:10.808 --> 00:04:12.574\na competitor in one business\n\n00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:15.899\nto use their position in one step of the value chain\n\n00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:17.731\nin order to penetrate or attack\n\n00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:20.895\nor disintermediate the competitor in another.\n\n00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:23.556\nThat is not just an abstract proposition.\n\n00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:25.235\nThere are many very specific stories\n\n00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:27.007\nof how that actually happened.\n\n00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:30.500\nA poster child example was\nthe encyclopedia business.\n\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.949\nThe encyclopedia business\n\n00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.051\nin the days of leatherbound books\n\n00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:35.755\nwas basically a distribution business.\n\n00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:38.209\nMost of the cost was the\ncommission to the salesmen.\n\n00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:40.835\nThe CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,\n\n00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:44.251\nnew technologies made the distribution of knowledge\n\n00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:46.530\nmany orders of magnitude cheaper,\n\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.244\nand the encyclopedia industry collapsed.\n\n00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:52.076\nIt's now, of course, a very familiar story.\n\n00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:54.118\nThis, in fact, more generally was the story\n\n00:04:54.118 --> 00:04:56.627\nof the first generation of the Internet economy.\n\n00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:58.827\nIt was about falling transaction costs\n\n00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:00.302\nbreaking up value chains\n\n00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:02.931\nand therefore allowing disintermediation,\n\n00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:05.268\nor what we call deconstruction.\n\n00:05:05.268 --> 00:05:07.585\nOne of the questions I was occasionally asked was,\n\n00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:10.101\nwell, what's going to replace the encyclopedia\n\n00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.752\nwhen Britannica no longer has a business model?\n\n00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:14.918\nAnd it was a while before\nthe answer became manifest.\n\n00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:17.705\nNow, of course, we know\nwhat it is: it's the Wikipedia.\n\n00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:20.928\nNow what's special about the\nWikipedia is not its distribution.\n\n00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:23.332\nWhat's special about the Wikipedia\nis the way it's produced.\n\n00:05:23.332 --> 00:05:25.572\nThe Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia\n\n00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:28.099\ncreated by its users.\n\n00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.979\nAnd this, in fact, defines what you might call\n\n00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.467\nthe second decade of the Internet economy,\n\n00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:35.827\nthe decade in which the Internet as a noun\n\n00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:37.734\nbecame the Internet as a verb.\n\n00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:39.603\nIt became a set of conversations,\n\n00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:43.679\nthe era in which user-generated\ncontent and social networks\n\n00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:46.370\nbecame the dominant phenomenon.\n\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.268\nNow what that really meant\n\n00:05:48.268 --> 00:05:51.642\nin terms of the Porter-Henderson framework\n\n00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:55.033\nwas the collapse of certain\nkinds of economies of scale.\n\n00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:57.371\nIt turned out that tens of thousands\n\n00:05:57.371 --> 00:06:00.454\nof autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia\n\n00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:02.000\ncould do just as good a job,\n\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.691\nand certainly a much cheaper job,\n\n00:06:03.691 --> 00:06:06.670\nthan professionals in a hierarchical organization.\n\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.127\nSo basically what was happening was that one layer\n\n00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:12.021\nof this value chain was becoming fragmented,\n\n00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:13.865\nas individuals could take over\n\n00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:17.152\nwhere organizations were no longer needed.\n\n00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:19.784\nBut there's another question\nthat obviously this graph poses,\n\n00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:22.067\nwhich is, okay, we've\ngone through two decades --\n\n00:06:22.067 --> 00:06:24.745\ndoes anything distinguish the third?\n\n00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:26.860\nAnd what I'm going to argue is that indeed\n\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.365\nsomething does distinguish the third,\n\n00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:30.811\nand it maps exactly on to the kind of\n\n00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:33.279\nPorter-Henderson logic that\nwe've been talking about.\n\n00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.866\nAnd that is, about data.\n\n00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:37.535\nIf we go back to around 2000,\n\n00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:39.894\na lot of people were talking\nabout the information revolution,\n\n00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:42.195\nand it was indeed true that the world's stock of data\n\n00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:44.469\nwas growing, indeed growing quite fast.\n\n00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.327\nbut it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.\n\n00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:49.145\nWe go forward to 2007,\n\n00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:52.330\nnot only had the world's stock of data exploded,\n\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.850\nbut there'd been this massive substitution\n\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.865\nof digital for analog.\n\n00:06:56.865 --> 00:06:58.734\nAnd more important even than that,\n\n00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:00.474\nif you look more carefully at this graph,\n\n00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.494\nwhat you will observe is that about a half\n\n00:07:02.494 --> 00:07:04.108\nof that digital data\n\n00:07:04.108 --> 00:07:06.494\nis information that has an I.P. address.\n\n00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:09.345\nIt's on a server or it's on a P.C.\n\n00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.152\nBut having an I.P. address means that it\n\n00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:13.322\ncan be connected to any other data\n\n00:07:13.322 --> 00:07:15.185\nthat has an I.P. address.\n\n00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.831\nIt means it becomes possible\n\n00:07:16.831 --> 00:07:19.918\nto put together half of the world's knowledge\n\n00:07:19.918 --> 00:07:21.570\nin order to see patterns,\n\n00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.927\nan entirely new thing.\n\n00:07:23.927 --> 00:07:25.895\nIf we run the numbers forward to today,\n\n00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:27.321\nit probably looks something like this.\n\n00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:28.489\nWe're not really sure.\n\n00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.517\nIf we run the numbers forward to 2020,\n\n00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.417\nwe of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.\n\n00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:37.757\nIt's curious that the future is so much\nmore predictable than the present.\n\n00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:42.152\nAnd what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication\n\n00:07:42.152 --> 00:07:45.125\nin the stock of information that is connected\n\n00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:47.353\nvia an I.P. address.\n\n00:07:47.353 --> 00:07:50.814\nNow, if the number of connections that we can make\n\n00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:53.954\nis proportional to the number of pairs of data points,\n\n00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:56.417\na hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data\n\n00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:58.520\nis a ten-thousandfold multiplication\n\n00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.085\nin the number of patterns\n\n00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:02.162\nthat we can see in that data,\n\n00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:04.822\nthis just in the last 10 or 11 years.\n\n00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:07.646\nThis, I would submit, is a sea change,\n\n00:08:07.646 --> 00:08:09.730\na profound change in the economics\n\n00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.681\nof the world that we live in.\n\n00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:12.845\nThe first human genome,\n\n00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:14.411\nthat of James Watson,\n\n00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:18.331\nwas mapped as the culmination of the\nHuman Genome Project in the year 2000,\n\n00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.508\nand it took about 200 million dollars\n\n00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:22.489\nand about 10 years of work to map\n\n00:08:22.489 --> 00:08:24.904\njust one person's genomic makeup.\n\n00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:27.509\nSince then, the costs of mapping\nthe genome have come down.\n\n00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:29.396\nIn fact, they've come down in recent years\n\n00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:31.070\nvery dramatically indeed,\n\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.516\nto the point where the cost \nis now below 1,000 dollars,\n\n00:08:33.516 --> 00:08:36.467\nand it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015\n\n00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:38.198\nit will be below 100 dollars --\n\n00:08:38.198 --> 00:08:41.394\na five or six order of magnitude drop\n\n00:08:41.394 --> 00:08:43.339\nin the cost of genomic mapping\n\n00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.762\nin just a 15-year period,\n\n00:08:45.762 --> 00:08:48.157\nan extraordinary phenomenon.\n\n00:08:48.157 --> 00:08:52.562\nNow, in the days when mapping a genome\n\n00:08:52.562 --> 00:08:55.571\ncost millions, or even tens of thousands,\n\n00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:57.549\nit was basically a research enterprise.\n\n00:08:57.549 --> 00:09:00.091\nScientists would gather some representative people,\n\n00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.305\nand they would see patterns, and they would try\n\n00:09:01.305 --> 00:09:04.195\nand make generalizations about\nhuman nature and disease\n\n00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:05.786\nfrom the abstract patterns they find\n\n00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:09.246\nfrom these particular selected individuals.\n\n00:09:09.246 --> 00:09:12.079\nBut when the genome can \nbe mapped for 100 bucks,\n\n00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:14.427\n99 dollars while you wait,\n\n00:09:14.427 --> 00:09:16.617\nthen what happens is, it becomes retail.\n\n00:09:16.617 --> 00:09:18.474\nIt becomes above all clinical.\n\n00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:19.686\nYou go the doctor with a cold,\n\n00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:21.620\nand if he or she hasn't done it already,\n\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.858\nthe first thing they do is map your genome,\n\n00:09:23.858 --> 00:09:25.513\nat which point what they're now doing\n\n00:09:25.513 --> 00:09:30.042\nis not starting from some abstract \nknowledge of genomic medicine\n\n00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:32.106\nand trying to work out how it applies to you,\n\n00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.675\nbut they're starting from your particular genome.\n\n00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:36.115\nNow think of the power of that.\n\n00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:37.904\nThink of where that takes us\n\n00:09:37.904 --> 00:09:40.850\nwhen we can combine genomic data\n\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.339\nwith clinical data\n\n00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:44.298\nwith data about drug interactions\n\n00:09:44.298 --> 00:09:46.587\nwith the kind of ambient data that devices\n\n00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.346\nlike our phone and medical sensors\n\n00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:50.204\nwill increasingly be collecting.\n\n00:09:50.204 --> 00:09:52.665\nThink what happens when we collect all of that data\n\n00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:54.138\nand we can put it together\n\n00:09:54.138 --> 00:09:56.626\nin order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.\n\n00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.537\nThis, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,\n\n00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:01.978\nbut this will drive a revolution in medicine.\n\n00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:04.298\nFabulous, lots of people talk about this.\n\n00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:06.737\nBut there's one thing that\ndoesn't get much attention.\n\n00:10:06.737 --> 00:10:10.021\nHow is that model of colossal sharing\n\n00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:12.667\nacross all of those kinds of databases\n\n00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:15.159\ncompatible with the business models\n\n00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:17.773\nof institutions and organizations and corporations\n\n00:10:17.773 --> 00:10:20.070\nthat are involved in this business today?\n\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.846\nIf your business is based on proprietary data,\n\n00:10:22.846 --> 00:10:25.889\nif your competitive advantage\nis defined by your data,\n\n00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:29.409\nhow on Earth is that company or is that society\n\n00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:31.507\nin fact going to achieve the value\n\n00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:34.512\nthat's implicit in the technology? They can't.\n\n00:10:34.512 --> 00:10:36.559\nSo essentially what's happening here,\n\n00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:39.203\nand genomics is merely one example of this,\n\n00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:41.517\nis that technology is driving\n\n00:10:41.517 --> 00:10:44.086\nthe natural scaling of the activity\n\n00:10:44.086 --> 00:10:47.013\nbeyond the institutional boundaries within which\n\n00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:49.171\nwe have been used to thinking about it,\n\n00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:51.334\nand in particular beyond the institutional boundaries\n\n00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:53.588\nin terms of which business strategy\n\n00:10:53.588 --> 00:10:57.043\nas a discipline is formulated.\n\n00:10:57.043 --> 00:11:00.529\nThe basic story here is that what used to be\n\n00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:04.191\nvertically integrated, oligopolistic competition\n\n00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:06.982\namong essentially similar kinds of competitors\n\n00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:09.441\nis evolving, by one means or another,\n\n00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:12.802\nfrom a vertical structure to a horizontal one.\n\n00:11:12.802 --> 00:11:14.517\nWhy is that happening?\n\n00:11:14.517 --> 00:11:17.022\nIt's happening because\ntransaction costs are plummeting\n\n00:11:17.022 --> 00:11:18.950\nand because scale is polarizing.\n\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.692\nThe plummeting of transaction costs\n\n00:11:20.692 --> 00:11:23.330\nweakens the glue that holds value chains together,\n\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.998\nand allows them to separate.\n\n00:11:24.998 --> 00:11:26.933\nThe polarization of scale economies\n\n00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:30.059\ntowards the very small -- small is beautiful --\n\n00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:32.727\nallows for scalable communities\n\n00:11:32.727 --> 00:11:35.844\nto substitute for conventional corporate production.\n\n00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:37.848\nThe scaling in the opposite direction,\n\n00:11:37.848 --> 00:11:39.881\ntowards things like big data,\n\n00:11:39.881 --> 00:11:41.290\ndrive the structure of business\n\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.013\ntowards the creation of new kinds of institutions\n\n00:11:44.013 --> 00:11:45.991\nthat can achieve that scale.\n\n00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:48.749\nBut either way, the typically vertical structure\n\n00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:51.753\ngets driven to becoming more horizontal.\n\n00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.168\nThe logic isn't just about big data.\n\n00:11:54.168 --> 00:11:57.494\nIf we were to look, for example,\nat the telecommunications industry,\n\n00:11:57.494 --> 00:11:59.869\nyou can tell the same story about fiber optics.\n\n00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:02.005\nIf we look at the pharmaceutical industry,\n\n00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:03.898\nor, for that matter, university research,\n\n00:12:03.898 --> 00:12:05.572\nyou can say exactly the same story\n\n00:12:05.572 --> 00:12:07.311\nabout so-called \"big science.\"\n\n00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:08.846\nAnd in the opposite direction,\n\n00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:11.043\nif we look, say, at the energy sector,\n\n00:12:11.043 --> 00:12:13.903\nwhere all the talk is about how households\n\n00:12:13.903 --> 00:12:17.487\nwill be efficient producers of green energy\n\n00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.115\nand efficient conservers of energy,\n\n00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.995\nthat is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.\n\n00:12:21.995 --> 00:12:23.865\nThat is the fragmentation of scale\n\n00:12:23.865 --> 00:12:26.219\nbecause the very small can substitute\n\n00:12:26.219 --> 00:12:28.813\nfor the traditional corporate scale.\n\n00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:30.604\nEither way, what we are driven to\n\n00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:33.975\nis this horizontalization of the structure of industries,\n\n00:12:33.975 --> 00:12:36.565\nand that implies fundamental changes\n\n00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:38.627\nin how we think about strategy.\n\n00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:40.659\nIt means, for example, that we need to think\n\n00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:43.206\nabout strategy as the curation\n\n00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:45.851\nof these kinds of horizontal structure,\n\n00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:47.491\nwhere things like business definition\n\n00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:49.053\nand even industry definition\n\n00:12:49.053 --> 00:12:51.855\nare actually the outcomes of strategy,\n\n00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:55.036\nnot something that the strategy presupposes.\n\n00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:58.192\nIt means, for example, we need to work out\n\n00:12:58.192 --> 00:13:00.549\nhow to accommodate collaboration\n\n00:13:00.549 --> 00:13:02.415\nand competition simultaneously.\n\n00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.501\nThink about the genome.\n\n00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:05.279\nWe need to accommodate the very large\n\n00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:07.414\nand the very small simultaneously.\n\n00:13:07.414 --> 00:13:09.357\nAnd we need industry structures\n\n00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:12.299\nthat will accommodate very,\nvery different motivations,\n\n00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:14.932\nfrom the amateur motivations\nof people in communities\n\n00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:16.905\nto maybe the social motivations\n\n00:13:16.905 --> 00:13:19.241\nof infrastructure built by governments,\n\n00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:21.866\nor, for that matter, cooperative institutions\n\n00:13:21.866 --> 00:13:24.358\nbuilt by companies that are otherwise competing,\n\n00:13:24.358 --> 00:13:27.352\nbecause that is the only way\nthat they can get to scale.\n\n00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:29.329\nThese kinds of transformations\n\n00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:33.054\nrender the traditional premises \nof business strategy obsolete.\n\n00:13:33.054 --> 00:13:35.623\nThey drive us into a completely new world.\n\n00:13:35.623 --> 00:13:37.044\nThey require us, whether we are\n\n00:13:37.044 --> 00:13:39.811\nin the public sector or the private sector,\n\n00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:42.111\nto think very fundamentally differently\n\n00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:43.931\nabout the structure of business,\n\n00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:47.385\nand, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.\n\n00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:50.198\nThank you.\n\n00:13:50.198 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_soghoian_government_surveillance_this_is_just_the_beginning", "transcript": "The 2011 Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries, who were worried that revolution would spread. To respond, they ramped up surveillance of activists, journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries. One prominent Bahraini activist, who was arrested and tortured by his government, has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages.Of course, it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. Instead, they use tools like Skype, which they think are immune to interception. They're wrong. There have now been over the last few years an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments, specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Rather than intercepting the communications  as they go over the wire, instead they now hack into your computer, enable your webcam, enable your microphone, and steal documents from your computer.When the government of Egypt fell in 2011, activists raided the office of the secret police, and among the many documents they found was this document by the Gamma Corporation, by Gamma International. Gamma is a German company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments. It's important to note that most governments don't really have the in-house capabilities to develop this software. Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise, and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price. Gamma is just one of these companies. I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. They'd sent them an invoice for a sale, but the Egyptians never bought it. Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. (Laughter)So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. Really, they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air-conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. You know, your webcam light won't turn on. There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled.This is the managing director of Gamma International. His name is Martin Muench. There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. This is perhaps my favorite. I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. He knows what kind of surveillance is possible, and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him. Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles. Of course, he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments, he has no way of knowing how it can be used. Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world, many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations. They really are selling their software around the world.Gamma is not the only company in the business. As I said, it's a $5 billion industry. One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team. Now, Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation. The video they've produced is very sexy, and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients.(Video) Narrator: You want to look  through your target's eyes. (Music) You have to hack your target. [\"While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders\"] You have to hit many different platforms. [\"Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Linux\"] You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data. [Skype & encrypted calls, target location,  messaging, relationships, web browsing, audio & video\"] Being stealth and untraceable. [\"Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure\"] Deployed all over your country. [\"Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot\"] Exactly what we do.Christopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true, but, in fact, Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. Last year we learned, for example, that it's been used to target Moroccan  journalists by the Moroccan government. Many, many countries it's been found in. So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. In the last year or so, the company has opened a sales office in Maryland. The company has also hired a spokesperson. They've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up. They've spoken at the conferences. What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States, but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it, it isn't because they haven't been trying hard.So as I said before, governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off-the-shelf surveillance software, and so for that reason, you see that the government of, say, Tunisia, might use the same software as the government of Germany. They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology, and so for several years, I've been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2014 they're a civil society group \u2014 obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. Most of these documents were heavily redacted, but what you can see from the slides, if I zoom in, is this term: Remote Operations Unit. Now, when I first looked into this, I'd never heard of this unit before. I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. I'd never heard of it. And so I went online and I did some research, and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn, the social networking site for job seekers. There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit, and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job. (Laughter) So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal, and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Like Gamma and Hacking Team, the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams, microphones, steal documents, get web browsing information, the works.There's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking, and that's that terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers. There's no drug dealer phone and there's no journalist laptop. We all use the same technology, and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys, they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too.So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. They've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique, but without any real debate. In the United States, where I live, there have been no congressional hearings. There's no law that's been passed specifically authorizing this technique, and because of its power and potential for abuse, it's vital that we have an informed public debate.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1940, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.734\nThe 2011 Arab Spring\n\n00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.537\ncaptured

00:02:37.632\nThis is the managing director\nof Gamma International.\n\n00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:39.493\nHis name is Martin Muench.\n\n00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:42.424\nThere are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.\n\n00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:44.276\nThis is perhaps my favorite.\n\n00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:46.420\nI'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.\n\n00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.088\nYou can see there's a little sticker\n\n00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:49.981\nthat's placed over his camera.\n\n00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:52.514\nHe knows what kind of surveillance is possible,\n\n00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:54.320\nand so clearly he doesn't want it to be used\n\n00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.922\nagainst him.\n\n00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:57.846\nMuench has said that he intends\n\n00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:59.510\nfor his software to be used\n\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.493\nto capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.\n\n00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:04.289\nOf course, he's also acknowledged that once\n\n00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.444\nthe software has been sold to governments,\n\n00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:10.269\nhe has no way of knowing how it can be used.\n\n00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.119\nGamma's software has been located on servers\n\n00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:13.775\nin countries around the world,\n\n00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:16.166\nmany with really atrocious track records\n\n00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:17.727\nand human rights violations.\n\n00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:21.122\nThey really are selling their\nsoftware around the world.\n\n00:03:21.122 --> 00:03:23.423\nGamma is not the only company in the business.\n\n00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:26.174\nAs I said, it's a $5 billion industry.\n\n00:03:26.174 --> 00:03:29.013\nOne of the other big guys in the industry\n\n00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:31.408\nis an Italian company called Hacking Team.\n\n00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:33.133\nNow, Hacking Team has what is probably\n\n00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.103\nthe slickest presentation.\n\n00:03:35.103 --> 00:03:38.131\nThe video they've produced is very sexy,\n\n00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:39.779\nand so I'm going to play you a clip\n\n00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.093\njust so you can get a feel\n\n00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:42.924\nboth for the capabilities of the software\n\n00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.830\nbut also how it's marketed\n\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.598\nto their government clients.\n\n00:03:46.598 --> 00:03:50.114\n(Video) Narrator: You want to look \nthrough your target's eyes.\n\n00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:52.021\n(Music)\n\n00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:55.023\nYou have to hack your target.\n\n00:03:55.023 --> 00:04:01.339\n[\"While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders\"]\n\n00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.262\nYou have to hit many different platforms.\n\n00:04:04.262 --> 00:04:08.142\n[\"Windows, OS X, iOS, Android,\nBlackberry, Symbian, Linux\"]\n\n00:04:08.142 --> 00:04:10.610\nYou have to overcome encryption\n\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.507\nand capture relevant data.\n\n00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:18.066\n[Skype &amp; encrypted calls, target location, \nmessaging, relationships,\n\n00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:21.238\nweb browsing, audio &amp; video\"]\n\n00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:25.398\nBeing stealth and untraceable.\n\n00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.672\n[\"Immune to any protection system\nHidden collection infrastructure\"]\n\n00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:32.777\nDeployed all over your country.\n\n00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:37.311\n[\"Up to hundreds of thousands of targets\nManaged from a single spot\"]\n\n00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:40.633\nExactly what we do.\n\n00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:42.896\nChristopher Soghoian: So, it\nwould be funny if it wasn't true,\n\n00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:44.684\nbut, in fact, Hacking Team's software\n\n00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.632\nis being sold to governments around the world.\n\n00:04:47.632 --> 00:04:49.384\nLast year we learned, for example,\n\n00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:53.432\nthat it's been used to target Moroccan \njournalists by the Moroccan government.\n\n00:04:53.432 --> 00:04:55.976\nMany, many countries it's been found in.\n\n00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:59.100\nSo, Hacking Team has also been actively courting\n\n00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.443\nthe U.S. law enforcement market.\n\n00:05:01.443 --> 00:05:03.726\nIn the last year or so, the company\n\n00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:08.502\nhas opened a sales office in Maryland.\n\n00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:10.616\nThe company has also hired a spokesperson.\n\n00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:12.153\nThey've been attending\n\n00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:13.750\nsurveillance industry conferences\n\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.765\nwhere law enforcement officials show up.\n\n00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:17.599\nThey've spoken at the conferences.\n\n00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.187\nWhat I thought was most fascinating was\n\n00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:21.288\nthey've actually paid for the coffee break\n\n00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:23.228\nat one of the law enforcement conferences\n\n00:05:23.228 --> 00:05:24.721\nearlier this year.\n\n00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:26.820\nI can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team\n\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.545\nhas sold their technology in the United States,\n\n00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:31.516\nbut what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,\n\n00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:34.691\nit isn't because they haven't been trying hard.\n\n00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:36.733\nSo as I said before,\n\n00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:38.653\ngovernments that don't really have the resources\n\n00:05:38.653 --> 00:05:40.249\nto build their own tools will buy\n\n00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:41.659\noff-the-shelf surveillance software,\n\n00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.047\nand so for that reason,\n\n00:05:43.047 --> 00:05:45.763\nyou see that the government of, say, Tunisia,\n\n00:05:45.763 --> 00:05:47.951\nmight use the same software\nas the government of Germany.\n\n00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:50.223\nThey're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.\n\n00:05:50.223 --> 00:05:52.422\nThe Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation in the United States\n\n00:05:52.422 --> 00:05:55.184\ndoes have the budget to build\ntheir own surveillance technology,\n\n00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:56.965\nand so for several years, I've been trying\n\n00:05:56.965 --> 00:05:59.356\nto figure out if and how the FBI\n\n00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:02.254\nis hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.\n\n00:06:02.254 --> 00:06:05.407\nMy friends at an organization called\nthe Electronic Frontier Foundation --\n\n00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.719\nthey're a civil society group \u2014\n\n00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.211\nobtained hundreds of documents from the FBI\n\n00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:13.059\ndetailing their next generation\nof surveillance technologies.\n\n00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:15.693\nMost of these documents were heavily redacted,\n\n00:06:15.693 --> 00:06:18.509\nbut what you can see from the slides,\n\n00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.471\nif I zoom in, is this term:\n\n00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:22.291\nRemote Operations Unit.\n\n00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:24.525\nNow, when I first looked into this,\n\n00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:26.595\nI'd never heard of this unit before.\n\n00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.897\nI've been studying surveillance\nfor more than six years.\n\n00:06:28.897 --> 00:06:30.182\nI'd never heard of it.\n\n00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:32.145\nAnd so I went online and I did some research,\n\n00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:34.270\nand ultimately I hit the mother lode\n\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.904\nwhen I went to LinkedIn,\n\n00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:38.473\nthe social networking site for job seekers.\n\n00:06:38.473 --> 00:06:41.386\nThere were lots of former\nU.S. government contractors\n\n00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.773\nwho had at one point worked\n\n00:06:42.773 --> 00:06:44.082\nfor the Remote Operating Unit,\n\n00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:47.496\nand were describing in surprising detail on their CVs\n\n00:06:47.496 --> 00:06:49.527\nwhat they had done in their former job.\n\n00:06:49.527 --> 00:06:51.749\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:53.736\nSo I took this information\n\n00:06:53.736 --> 00:06:57.480\nand I gave it to a journalist that I know\nand trust at the Wall Street Journal,\n\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.281\nand she was able to contact several other\n\n00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:01.035\nformer law enforcement officials\n\n00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:02.841\nwho spoke on background and confirmed\n\n00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:06.200\nthat yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team\n\n00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.336\nthat does nothing but hack into the computers\n\n00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.862\nof surveillance targets.\n\n00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.750\nLike Gamma and Hacking Team,\n\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.867\nthe FBI also has the capability\n\n00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:17.261\nto remotely activate webcams, microphones,\n\n00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:19.463\nsteal documents, get web browsing information,\n\n00:07:19.463 --> 00:07:21.147\nthe works.\n\n00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:22.969\nThere's sort of a big problem\n\n00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:24.569\nwith governments going into hacking,\n\n00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.088\nand that's that terrorists, pedophiles,\n\n00:07:27.088 --> 00:07:29.999\ndrug dealers, journalists and human rights activists\n\n00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.270\nall use the same kinds of computers.\n\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.317\nThere's no drug dealer phone\n\n00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:36.283\nand there's no journalist laptop.\n\n00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:38.517\nWe all use the same technology,\n\n00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:40.411\nand what that means then is that for governments\n\n00:07:40.411 --> 00:07:42.528\nto have the capability to hack into the computers\n\n00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:44.227\nof the real bad guys,\n\n00:07:44.227 --> 00:07:46.203\nthey also have to have the capability\n\n00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:48.388\nto hack into our devices too.\n\n00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:50.140\nSo governments around the world\n\n00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.601\nhave been embracing this technology.\n\n00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:53.206\nThey've been embracing hacking\n\n00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.026\nas a law enforcement technique,\n\n00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:56.976\nbut without any real debate.\n\n00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.795\nIn the United States, where I live,\n\n00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:00.620\nthere have been no congressional hearings.\n\n00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.581\nThere's no law that's been passed\n\n00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:04.654\nspecifically authorizing this technique,\n\n00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:07.323\nand because of its power and potential for abuse,\n\n00:08:07.323 --> 00:08:10.270\nit's vital that we have an informed public debate.\n\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.216\nThank you very much.\n\n00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:13.772\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My DNA vending machine", "duration": "296", "url":

It's in a shopping mall, and it sells fish eggs. It's a caviar-vending machine.This is the Art-o-mat, an art-vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists, usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes, in limited edition.This is Oliver Medvedik. He is not a vending machine, but he is one of the founders of Genspace, a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York, where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. In fact, I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago, and this is what led me into this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now. Strawberry DNA is really fascinating, because it's so beautiful. I'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before, before I saw it in this form. A lot of people, especially in the art community, don't necessarily engage in science in this way. I instantly joined Genspace after this, and asked Oliver, \"If we can do this with strawberries, can we do this with people?\" About 10 minutes later, we were both spitting in vials, coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction. I started doing this on my own. This is what my DNA actually looks like.And I was at a dinner party with some artist friends, and I was telling them about this project, and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA. So I said, all right, let's get out some supplies right now. And I started having these bizarre dinner parties on Friday nights, where people would come over and we'd do DNA extractions, and I would capture them on video, because it created this kind of funny portrait as well.(Laughter)These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science. You can kind of tell from their reactions.(Laughter)But they became fascinated by it, and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science.And so I started doing this regularly.(Laughter)It's an odd thing to do with your Friday nights, but this is what I started doing. I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials and categorizing them. This is what that looked like. And it started to make me think about a couple of things. First, this looked a lot like my Facebook wall. So in a way, I created sort of a genetic social network.And the second thing was, one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like,  \"Uh ... why are they numbered? Is this person more rare than the other one?\" And I hadn't even thought about that. They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. But that made me think about collecting toys, and what's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys, and being able to collect these rare toys. You buy these boxes, but aren't sure what's going to be inside. But when you open them, you have different rarities of the toys. I thought that was interesting; I thought about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art-o-mat all together. And for some reason, I was one night drawing a vending machine, thinking of doing paintings of a vending machine. The vial of my DNA was sitting there, and I saw a beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine. So I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine. Here it is.(Music)[DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology.](Music)[For a reasonable cost, you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine.](Music)[Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.](Music)[DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.](Music ends)Gabriel Barcia-Colombo: The DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple of galleries in New York, and it's selling out pretty well. We're in the first edition of 100 pieces, hoping to do another edition pretty soon. I'd like to get it into more of a metro hub, like Grand Central or Penn Station, next to some of the other vending machines in that location.But really, with this and a lot of my art projects, I want to ask the audience a question: When biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting or 3D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine, will you submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine? How much will these samples be worth? Will you buy someone else's sample? And what will you be able to do with that sample?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1942, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:14.680\nThis is a

00:01:03.801\ndon't necessarily engage\nin science in this way.\n\n00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:05.700\nI instantly joined Genspace after this,\n\n00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.308\nand asked Oliver, \"If we can do\nthis with strawberries,\n\n00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:09.719\ncan we do this with people?\"\n\n00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:12.372\nAbout 10 minutes later,\nwe were both spitting in vials,\n\n00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:14.914\ncoming up with a protocol\nfor human DNA extraction.\n\n00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:16.441\nI started doing this on my own.\n\n00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:18.427\nThis is what my DNA actually looks like.\n\n00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.002\nAnd I was at a dinner party\nwith some artist friends,\n\n00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.045\nand I was telling them about this project,\n\n00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.787\nand they couldn't believe\nthat you could actually see DNA.\n\n00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.643\nSo I said, all right, let's get out\nsome supplies right now.\n\n00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:31.819\nAnd I started having these bizarre\ndinner parties on Friday nights,\n\n00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:34.516\nwhere people would come over\nand we'd do DNA extractions,\n\n00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.184\nand I would capture them on video,\n\n00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:38.890\nbecause it created\nthis kind of funny portrait as well.\n\n00:01:38.914 --> 00:01:41.403\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:44.828\nThese are people who don't necessarily\nregularly engage with science.\n\n00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:47.017\nYou can kind of tell from their reactions.\n\n00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:48.840\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:50.468\nBut they became fascinated by it,\n\n00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:53.919\nand it was really exciting for me\nto see them get excited about science.\n\n00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:56.073\nAnd so I started doing this regularly.\n\n00:01:56.097 --> 00:01:57.670\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:57.694 --> 00:01:59.973\nIt's an odd thing to do\nwith your Friday nights,\n\n00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:01.576\nbut this is what I started doing.\n\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.817\nI started collecting a whole group\nof my friends' DNA in small vials\n\n00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:06.018\nand categorizing them.\n\n00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:07.487\nThis is what that looked like.\n\n00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:10.225\nAnd it started to make me think\nabout a couple of things.\n\n00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.457\nFirst, this looked a lot\nlike my Facebook wall.\n\n00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:15.669\nSo in a way, I created\nsort of a genetic social network.\n\n00:02:15.693 --> 00:02:16.928\nAnd the second thing was,\n\n00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:19.741\none time a friend came over\nand looked at this on my table\n\n00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.958\nand was like, \n\"Uh ... why are they numbered?\n\n00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:24.259\nIs this person more rare\nthan the other one?\"\n\n00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:26.069\nAnd I hadn't even thought about that.\n\n00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:27.253\nThey were just numbered\n\n00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:29.888\nbecause that was the order\nthat I extracted the DNA in.\n\n00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:32.022\nBut that made me think\nabout collecting toys,\n\n00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:35.261\nand what's going on right now\nin the toy world with blind box toys,\n\n00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:37.344\nand being able to collect these rare toys.\n\n00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:40.365\nYou buy these boxes, but aren't sure\nwhat's going to be inside.\n\n00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.396\nBut when you open them,\nyou have different rarities of the toys.\n\n00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.859\nI thought that was interesting;\nI thought about this\n\n00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:48.792\nand the caviar vending machine\nand the Art-o-mat all together.\n\n00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:51.774\nAnd for some reason, I was one night\ndrawing a vending machine,\n\n00:02:51.798 --> 00:02:54.133\nthinking of doing paintings\nof a vending machine.\n\n00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:55.937\nThe vial of my DNA was sitting there,\n\n00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:58.887\nand I saw a beautiful collaboration\nbetween the strands of DNA\n\n00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.584\nand the coils of a vending machine.\n\n00:03:00.608 --> 00:03:04.105\nSo I decided to create an art installation\ncalled the DNA Vending Machine.\n\n00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.363\nHere it is.\n\n00:03:05.387 --> 00:03:10.464\n(Music)\n\n00:03:10.488 --> 00:03:12.546\n[DNA Vending Machine\nis an art installation\n\n00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.772\nabout our increasing access\nto

00:04:09.959\nThe DNA Vending Machine is currently\nin a couple of galleries in New York,\n\n00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.582\nand it's selling out pretty well.\n\n00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:13.594\nWe're in the first edition of 100 pieces,\n\n00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:15.572\nhoping to do another edition pretty soon.\n\n00:04:15.596 --> 00:04:17.675\nI'd like to get it\ninto more of a metro hub,\n\n00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.382\nlike Grand Central or Penn Station,\n\n00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:22.256\nnext to some of the other\nvending machines in that location.\n\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.661\nBut really, with this\nand a lot of my art projects,\n\n00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:26.517\nI want to ask the audience a question:\n\n00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:30.363\nWhen biotechnology and DNA sequencing\nbecomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting\n\n00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:34.273\nor 3D printing or buying caviar\nfrom a vending machine,\n\n00:04:34.297 --> 00:04:37.597\nwill you submit your sample of DNA\nto be part of the vending machine?\n\n00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:39.408\nHow much will these samples be worth?\n\n00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:41.297\nWill you buy someone else's sample?\n\n00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:43.682\nAnd what will you be able to do\nwith that sample?\n\n00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:46.228\nThank you.\n\n00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:50.831\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A 50-cent microscope that folds like origami", "duration": "561", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/manu_prakash_a_50_cent_microscope_that_folds_like_origami", "transcript": "The year is 1800. A curious little invention is being talked about. It's called a microscope. What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye. Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases. Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup, not very far from here. This is from London.Fast forward 200 years. We still have this monster soup around, and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt. Just for malaria itself, there are a million deaths a year, and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections.Now it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters. You take a stain, like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa, and a microscope, and you look at them. They all have faces. Why is that so, that Alex in Kenya, Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai, and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick? And that's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach. And remember that number: one billion.The problem lies with the microscope itself. Even though the pinnacle of modern science, research microscopes are not designed for field testing. Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all. They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain, and cost a lot of money. This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India.Two of my students, Jim and James, traveled around India and Thailand, starting to think about this problem a lot. We saw all kinds of donated equipment. We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses. And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on. What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.So what is a Foldscope? A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope, a platform for fluorescence, bright-field, polarization, projection, all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper. So, now you think, how is that possible? I'm going to show you some examples here, and we will run through some of them. It starts with a single sheet of paper. What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope. So, there are three stages: There is the optical stage, the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage. And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself. What you do is, you take it on, and just like you are playing like a toy, which it is, I tab it off, and I break it off.This paper has no instructions and no languages. There is a code, a color code embedded, that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope. When it's done, it looks something like this, has all the functionalities of a standard microscope, just like an XY stage, a place where a sample slide could go, for example right here. We didn't want to change this, because this is the standard that's been optimized for over the years, and many health workers are actually used to this. So this is what changes, but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases. You pop this in. There is an XY stage, and then there is a focusing stage, which is a flexure mechanism that's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps.So what's really interesting about this object, and my students hate when I do this, but I'm going to do this anyway, is these are rugged devices. I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it. And they last, even though they're designed from a very flexible material, like paper.Another fun fact is, this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool, but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder. And I'm going to pick one randomly. This one, it turns out, is actually designed specifically for malaria, because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria. So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this.So up till now, you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups. So what I would like to do is, if we could dim the lights, please, it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes. I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn \u2014 go to the back of the wall \u2014 and just project, and this way you will see exactly what I would see. What you're looking at \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 This is a cross-section of a compound eye, and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there, I am going through the z-axis. You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern. Another example, one of my favorite insects, I love to hate this one, is a mosquito, and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens. Right there. All from the simple setup that I actually described.So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer. So it turns out they're waterproof, and \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 right here is just fluorescent water, and I don't know if you can actually see this. This also shows you how  the projection scope works. You get to see the beam the  way it's projected and bent.Can we get the lights back on again?So I'm quickly going to show you, since I'm running out of time, in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture, the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing, so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs. (Applause) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy, which we call use-and-throw microscopy. I'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in. Here is a sheet of paper. This is when we were thinking about the idea. This is an A4 sheet of paper. These are the three stages that you actually see. And the optical components, if you look at the inset up on the right, we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs, so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself. So that's where the lenses go. There are some light sources. And essentially, in the end, all the parts line up because of origami, because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment. So even though this looks like a simple toy, the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated.So here is another obvious thing that we would do, typically, if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust, is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself. There it is, and it survives.So for us, the next step actually is really finishing our field trials. We are starting at the end of the summer. We are at a stage where we'll be  making thousands of microscopes. That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place. We've started collecting data for malaria, Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.And I want to leave you with this picture. I had not anticipated this before, but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health. What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow? I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1941, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.028\nThe year is 1800.\n\n00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:18.084\nA curious little invention is being talked about.\n\n00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:21.165\nIt's called a microscope.\n\n00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:22.944\nWhat it allows you to do\n\n00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:25.586\nis see tiny little lifeforms\n\n00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:28.073\nthat are invisible to the naked eye.\n\n00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:30.101\nSoon comes the medical discovery\n\n00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.186\nthat many of these lifeforms are actually causes\n\n00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:35.377\nof terrible human diseases.\n\n00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:38.162\nImagine what happened to the society\n\n00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.150\nwhen they realized\n\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.966\nthat an English mom in her teacup\n\n00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.102\nactually was drinking a monster soup,\n\n00:00:46.102 --> 00:00:49.251\nnot very far from here.

--> 00:02:55.476\npolarization, projection,\n\n00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:58.044\nall kinds of advanced microscopy\n\n00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:01.259\nbuilt purely by folding paper.\n\n00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.120\nSo, now you think, how is that possible?\n\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.083\nI'm going to show you some examples here,\n\n00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:07.884\nand we will run through some of them.\n\n00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:11.668\nIt starts with a single sheet of paper.\n\n00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:15.039\nWhat you see here is all the possible components\n\n00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:19.464\nto build a functional bright-field\nand fluorescence microscope.\n\n00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:21.273\nSo, there are three stages:\n\n00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:24.022\nThere is the optical stage, the illumination stage\n\n00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:26.490\nand the mask-holding stage.\n\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.362\nAnd there are micro optics at the bottom\n\n00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:31.236\nthat's actually embedded in the paper itself.\n\n00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.740\nWhat you do is, you take it on,\n\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.516\nand just like you are playing like a toy,\n\n00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.603\nwhich it is,\n\n00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:43.572\nI tab it off,\n\n00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.179\nand I break it off.\n\n00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.903\nThis paper has no instructions and no languages.\n\n00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:54.222\nThere is a code, a color code embedded,\n\n00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:58.833\nthat tells you exactly how to\nfold that specific microscope.\n\n00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:01.482\nWhen it's done, it looks something like this,\n\n00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:04.213\nhas all the functionalities of a standard microscope,\n\n00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:06.094\njust like an XY stage,\n\n00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:10.515\na place where a sample slide could go,\n\n00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:13.055\nfor example right here.\n\n00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:14.567\nWe didn't want to change this,\n\n00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:15.939\nbecause this is the standard\n\n00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.792\nthat's been optimized for over the years,\n\n00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:20.488\nand many health workers are actually used to this.\n\n00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:21.949\nSo this is what changes,\n\n00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.116\nbut the standard stains all remain the same\n\n00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:25.891\nfor many different diseases.\n\n00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.823\nYou pop this in.\n\n00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:32.709\nThere is an XY stage,\n\n00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:34.682\nand then there is a focusing stage,\n\n00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:36.548\nwhich is a flexure mechanism\n\n00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:39.101\nthat's built in paper itself that allows us to move\n\n00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.082\nand focus the lenses by micron steps.\n\n00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:44.215\nSo what's really interesting about this object,\n\n00:04:44.215 --> 00:04:46.098\nand my students hate when I do this,\n\n00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:47.859\nbut I'm going to do this anyway,\n\n00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:49.815\nis these are rugged devices.\n\n00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:54.392\nI can turn it on and throw it on the floor\n\n00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:57.344\nand really try to stomp on it.\n\n00:04:57.344 --> 00:04:59.719\nAnd they last, even though they're designed\n\n00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:03.182\nfrom a very flexible material, like paper.\n\n00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:06.034\nAnother fun fact is, this is what we actually\n\n00:05:06.034 --> 00:05:10.089\nsend out there as a standard diagnostic tool,\n\n00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:11.858\nbut here in this envelope\n\n00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:14.249\nI have 30 different foldscopes\n\n00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.980\nof different configurations all in a single folder.\n\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.792\nAnd I'm going to pick one randomly.\n\n00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:23.874\nThis one, it turns out, is actually designed\n\n00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:25.437\nspecifically for malaria,\n\n00:05:25.437 --> 00:05:27.748\nbecause it has the fluorescent filters built\n\n00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:29.845\nspecifically for diagnosing malaria.\n\n00:05:29.845 --> 00:05:33.773\nSo the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes\n\n00:05:33.773 --> 00:05:35.539\ncomes out of this.\n\n00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.478\nSo up till now, you didn't actually see\n\n00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:41.435\nwhat I would see from one of these setups.\n\n00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:43.116\nSo what I would like to do is,\n\n00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:44.742\nif we could dim the lights, please,\n\n00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:48.407\nit turns out foldscopes are\nalso projection microscopes.\n\n00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:50.941\nI have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn --\n\n00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:52.694\ngo to the back of the wall --\n\n00:05:52.694 --> 00:05:54.402\nand just project, and this way you will see\n\n00:05:54.402 --> 00:05:56.522\nexactly what I would see.\n\n00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.308\nWhat you're looking at --\n\n00:05:58.308 --> 00:06:00.691\n(Applause) \u2014\n\n00:06:00.691 --> 00:06:03.327\nThis is a cross-section of a compound eye,\n\n00:06:03.327 --> 00:06:05.678\nand when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,\n\n00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:07.922\nI am going through the z-axis.\n\n00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:10.946\nYou actually see how the lenses are cut together\n\n00:06:10.946 --> 00:06:12.519\nin the cross-section pattern.\n\n00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.075\nAnother example, one of my favorite insects,\n\n00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:17.052\nI love to hate this one,\n\n00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:18.833\nis a mosquito,\n\n00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:22.595\nand you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.\n\n00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:25.958\nRight there.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.171\nAll from the simple setup that I actually described.\n\n00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.944\nSo my wife has been field testing\n\n00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:33.944\nsome of our microscopes\n\n00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:36.425\nby washing my clothes whenever I forget them\n\n00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.454\nin the dryer.\n\n00:06:38.454 --> 00:06:41.254\nSo it turns out they're waterproof, and --\n\n00:06:41.254 --> 00:06:43.042\n(Laughter) \u2014\n\n00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:45.540\nright here is just fluorescent water,\n\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.090\nand I don't know if you can actually see this.\n\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.479\nThis also shows you how \nthe projection scope works.\n\n00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.132\nYou get to see the beam the \nway it's projected and bent.\n\n00:06:56.157 --> 00:06:59.097\nCan we get the lights back on again?\n\n00:06:59.097 --> 00:07:00.884\nSo I'm quickly going to show you,\n\n00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:02.933\nsince I'm running out of time,\n\n00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:05.359\nin terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,\n\n00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:08.439\nthe biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,\n\n00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.561\nso we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.\n\n00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:14.420\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.515\nAnd what this allows us to do\n\n00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:18.851\nis to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,\n\n00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:20.868\nwhich we call use-and-throw microscopy.\n\n00:07:20.868 --> 00:07:22.957\nI'm going to give you a quick snapshot\n\n00:07:22.957 --> 00:07:24.720\nof some of the parts that go in.\n\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.179\nHere is a sheet of paper.\n\n00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.268\nThis is when we were thinking about the idea.\n\n00:07:28.268 --> 00:07:29.623\nThis is an A4 sheet of paper.\n\n00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:31.604\nThese are the three stages that you actually see.\n\n00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:35.034\nAnd the optical components, if you\nlook at the inset up on the right,\n\n00:07:35.034 --> 00:07:37.461\nwe had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses\n\n00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:39.773\nin paper itself at really high throughputs,\n\n00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:41.632\nso it uses a process of self-assembly\n\n00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:42.744\nand surface tension\n\n00:07:42.744 --> 00:07:46.280\nto build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.\n\n00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.725\nSo that's where the lenses go.\n\n00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:49.337\nThere are some light sources.\n\n00:07:49.337 --> 00:07:50.722\nAnd essentially, in the end,\n\n00:07:50.722 --> 00:07:53.900\nall the parts line up because of origami,\n\n00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.171\nbecause of the fact that origami allows us\n\n00:07:57.171 --> 00:08:00.151\nmicron-scale precision of optical alignment.\n\n00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:02.780\nSo even though this looks like a simple toy,\n\n00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.694\nthe aspects of engineering that go in\n\n00:08:04.694 --> 00:08:07.380\nsomething like this are fairly sophisticated.\n\n00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.615\nSo here is another obvious thing that we would do,\n\n00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.208\ntypically, if I was going to show\n\n00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:13.713\nthat these microscopes are robust,\n\n00:08:13.713 --> 00:08:17.551\nis go to the third floor and\ndrop it from the floor itself.\n\n00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:20.874\nThere it is, and it survives.\n\n00:08:20.874 --> 00:08:23.051\nSo for us, the next step actually\n\n00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:24.890\nis really finishing our field trials.\n\n00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.995\nWe are starting at the end of the summer.\n\n00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:29.922\nWe are at a stage where we'll be \nmaking thousands of microscopes.\n\n00:08:29.922 --> 00:08:32.066\nThat would be the first time where we would be\n\n00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:34.151\ndoing field trials with the highest density\n\n00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:36.706\nof microscopes ever at a given place.\n\n00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:38.786\nWe've started collecting data for malaria,\n\n00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:42.582\nChagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.\n\n00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:44.676\nAnd I want to leave you with this picture.\n\n00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:46.601\nI had not anticipated this before,\n\n00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:48.288\nbut a really interesting link\n\n00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:50.183\nbetween hands-on science education\n\n00:08:50.183 --> 00:08:51.441\nand global health.\n\n00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:54.367\nWhat are the tools that we're actually providing\n\n00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.547\nthe kids who are going to fight\n\n00:08:56.547 --> 00:08:58.465\nthis monster soup for tomorrow?\n\n00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:00.823\nI would love for them to be able to just print out\n\n00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:02.952\na Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.\n\n00:09:02.952 --> 00:09:05.858\nThank you.\n\n00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:10.301\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A word game to communicate in any language", "duration": "943", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ajit_narayanan_a_word_game_to_communicate_in_any_language", "transcript": "I work with children with autism. Specifically, I make technologies to help them communicate.Now, many of the problems that children with autism face, they have a common source, and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction, symbolism. And because of this, they have  a lot of difficulty with language.Let me tell you a little bit about why this is. You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup. All of us can see it. All of us understand this. These are two other pictures of soup, but you can see that these are more abstract These are not quite as concrete. And when you get to language, you see that it becomes a word whose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds, has absolutely nothing to do  with what it started with, or what it represents, which is the bowl of soup. So it's essentially a completely abstract, a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world, and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with. Now that's why most of the people  that work with children with autism \u2014 speech therapists, educators \u2014 what they do is, they try to help children with autism communicate not with words, but with pictures. So if a child with autism wanted to say, \"I want soup,\" that child would pick three different pictures, \"I,\" \"want,\" and \"soup,\" and they would put these together, and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say. And this has been incredibly effective; for the last 30, 40 years people have been doing this. In fact, a few years back, I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this. It's called Avaz, and the way it works is that kids select different pictures. These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences, and these sentences are spoken out. So Avaz is essentially converting pictures, it's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.Now, this was very effective. There are thousands of children using this, you know, all over the world, and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn't do. And I realized something interesting: Avaz helps children with autism learn words. What it doesn't help them do is to learn word patterns. Let me explain this in a little more detail. Take this sentence: \"I want soup tonight.\" Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning. It's also the way in which these words are arranged, the way these words are modified and arranged. And that's why a sentence like \"I want soup tonight\" is different from a sentence like \"Soup want I tonight,\" which  is completely meaningless. So there is another hidden abstraction here which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with, and that's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings, to convey different ideas. Now, this is what we call grammar. And grammar is incredibly powerful, because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information, an infinite amount of ideas. It's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to.And so after I developed Avaz, I worried for a very long time about how I could give grammar  to children with autism. The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective. I happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with her mom, and this is what happened. Completely out of the blue, very spontaneously, the child got up and said, \"Eat.\" Now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions. So she asked, \"Eat what? Do  you want to eat ice cream? You want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat? You want to eat cream now? You want to eat ice cream in the evening?\" And then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible. She had been able to get that child to communicate an idea to her without grammar. And it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for. Instead of arranging words in an order, in sequence, as a sentence, you arrange them in this map, where they're all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions, in question-answer pairs. And so if you do this, then what you're conveying is not a sentence in English, but what you're conveying is really a meaning, the meaning of a sentence in English. Now, meaning is really the underbelly, in some sense, of language. It's what comes after thought but before language. And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form.So I was very excited by this, you know, hopping around all over the place, trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this. And I found that this is not enough. Why is this not enough? This is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation, you want to say, \"I don't want soup,\" then you can't do that by asking a question. You do that by changing the word \"want.\" Again, if you wanted to say, \"I wanted soup yesterday,\" you do that by converting the word \"want\" into \"wanted.\" It's a past tense. So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete. This is a map of words joined together as questions and answers, and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances. Let me show you this with a different example.Let's take this sentence: \"I told the carpenter I could not pay him.\" It's a fairly complicated sentence. The way that this particular system works, you can start with any part of this sentence. I'm going to start with the word \"tell.\" So this is the word \"tell.\" Now this happened in the past, so I'm going to make that \"told.\" Now, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to ask questions. So, who told? I told. I told whom? I told the carpenter. Now we start with a different part of the sentence. We start with the word \"pay,\" and we add the ability filter to it to make it \"can pay.\" Then we make it \"can't pay,\" and we can make it \"couldn't pay\" by making it the past tense. So who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay. Couldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter. And then you join these two together by asking this question: What did I tell the carpenter? I told the carpenter I could not pay him.Now think about this. This is \u2014(Applause)\u2014 this is a representation of this sentence without language. And there are two or three interesting things about this. First of all, I could have started anywhere. I didn't have to start with the word \"tell.\" I could have started anywhere in the sentence, and I could have made this entire thing. The second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker, if I was speaking in some other language, this map would actually hold true in any language. So long as the questions are standardized, the map is actually independent of language. So I call this FreeSpeech, and I was playing with this for many, many months. I was trying out so many different combinations of this.And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech. I was trying to convert language, convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech, and vice versa, and back and forth. And I realized that this particular configuration, this particular way of representing language, it allowed me to actually create very concise rules that go between FreeSpeech on one side and English on the other. So I could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into English. And so I developed this thing. I developed this thing called  the FreeSpeech Engine which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input and gives out perfectly grammatical English text. And by putting these two pieces together, the representation and the engine, I was able to create an app, a technology for children with autism, that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar.So I tried this out with kids with autism, and I found that there was an  incredible amount of identification. They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in English, and I started thinking about why that might be the case. And I had an idea, and I want to  talk to you about this idea next. In about 1997, about 15 years back, there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language, and they found something very interesting. They found that when you learn a language as a child, as a two-year-old, you learn it with a certain part of your brain, and when you learn a language as an adult \u2014 for example, if I wanted to learn Japanese right now \u2014 a completely different part of my brain is used. Now I don't know why that's the case, but my guess is that that's because when you learn a language as an adult, you almost invariably learn it through your native language, or through your first language. So what's interesting about FreeSpeech is that when you create a sentence or when you create language, a child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech, they're not using this support language, they're not using this bridge language. They're directly constructing the sentence.And so this gave me this idea. Is it possible to use FreeSpeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities? And so I tried a number of experiments. The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes, in the form of colors, and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works. And I built an app out of it, a game out of it, in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement, a sound reinforcement of visual structures, they're able to learn language. And this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise, and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us, and they're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them English. And the dream, the hope, the vision, really, is that when they learn English this way, they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue.All right, let's talk about something else. Let's talk about speech. This is speech. So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us. Now what's interesting about speech is that speech is one-dimensional. Why is it one-dimensional? It's one-dimensional because it's sound. It's also one-dimensional because our mouths are built that way. Our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound. But if you think about the brain, the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one-dimensional. I mean, we have these rich, complicated, multi-dimensional ideas. Now, it seems to me that language is really the brain's invention to convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought on one hand into speech on the other hand. Now what's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays, and almost all of that is done in the language domain. Take Google, for example. Google trawls all these countless billions of websites, all of which are in English, and when you want to use Google, you go into Google search, and you type in English, and it matches the English with the English. What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead? I have a suspicion that if we did this, we'd find that algorithms like searching, like retrieval, all of these things, are much simpler and also more effective, because they don't process the data structure of speech. Instead they're processing the data structure of thought. The data structure of thought. That's a provocative idea.But let's look at this in a little more detail. So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem. We have the Free Speech representation on one side, and we have the FreeSpeech  Engine, which generates English. Now if you think about it, FreeSpeech, I told you, is completely  language-independent. It doesn't have any specific information in it which is about English. So everything that this system knows about English is actually encoded into the engine. That's a pretty interesting concept in itself. You've encoded an entire human language into a software program. But if you look at what's inside the engine, it's actually not very complicated. It's not very complicated code. And what's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English-specific. And that gives this interesting idea. It might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many, many different languages, in Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili. And that gives another interesting idea. For example, supposing I was a writer, say, for a newspaper or for a magazine. I could create content in one language, FreeSpeech, and the person who's consuming that content, the person who's reading that particular information could choose any engine, and they could read it in their own mother tongue, in their native language. I mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea, especially for India. We have so many different languages. There's a song about India, and there's a description of the country as, it says, (in Sanskrit). That means \"ever-smiling speaker of beautiful languages.\"Language is beautiful. I think it's the most beautiful of human creations. I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented. It entertains, it educates, it enlightens, but what I like the most about language is that it empowers.I want to leave you with this. This is a photograph of my collaborators, my earliest collaborators when I started working on language and autism and various other things. The girl's name is Pavna, and that's her mother, Kalpana. And Pavna's an entrepreneur, but her story is much more remarkable than mine, because Pavna is about 23. She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy, so ever since she was born, she could neither move nor talk. And everything that she's accomplished so far, finishing school, going to college, starting a company, collaborating with me to develop Avaz, all of these things she's done with nothing more than moving her eyes.Daniel Webster said this: He said, \"If all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception, I would choose to keep the power of communication, for with it, I would regain all the rest.\" And that's why, of all of these incredible  applications of FreeSpeech, the one that's closest to my heart still remains the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate, the power of communication, to get back all the rest.Thank you.

All of us understand this.\n\n00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:48.488\nThese are two other pictures of soup,\n\n00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:50.555\nbut you can see that these are more abstract\n\n00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:52.411\nThese are not quite as concrete.\n\n00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.585\nAnd when you get to language,\n\n00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:56.453\nyou see that it becomes a word\n\n00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:59.714\nwhose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds,\n\n00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:02.626\nhas absolutely nothing to do \nwith what it started with,\n\n00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:05.456\nor what it represents, which is the bowl of soup.\n\n00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:08.356\nSo it's essentially a completely abstract,\n\n00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:10.932\na completely arbitrary representation of something\n\n00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:12.095\nwhich is in the real world,\n\n00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:13.886\nand this is something that children with autism\n\n00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:17.050\nhave an incredible amount of difficulty with.\n\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.801\nNow that's why most of the people \nthat work with children with autism --\n\n00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.679\nspeech therapists, educators --\n\n00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.312\nwhat they do is, they try to help children with autism\n\n00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:27.541\ncommunicate not with words, but with pictures.\n\n00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.471\nSo if a child with autism wanted to say,\n\n00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.929\n\"I want soup,\" that child would pick\n\n00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.189\nthree different pictures, \"I,\" \"want,\" and \"soup,\"\n\n00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.798\nand they would put these together,\n\n00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:37.665\nand then the therapist or the parent would\n\n00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:39.552\nunderstand that this is what the kid wants to say.\n\n00:01:39.552 --> 00:01:41.330\nAnd this has been incredibly effective;\n\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.471\nfor the last 30, 40 years\n\n00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.084\npeople have been doing this.\n\n00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:46.433\nIn fact, a few years back,\n\n00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:49.108\nI developed an app for the iPad\n\n00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.363\nwhich does exactly this. It's called Avaz,\n\n00:01:51.363 --> 00:01:53.642\nand the way it works is that kids select\n\n00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:54.963\ndifferent pictures.\n\n00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:57.533\nThese pictures are sequenced\ntogether to form sentences,\n\n00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:59.252\nand these sentences are spoken out.\n\n00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.277\nSo Avaz is essentially converting pictures,\n\n00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:06.237\nit's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.\n\n00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:07.955\nNow, this was very effective.\n\n00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:09.339\nThere are thousands of children using this,\n\n00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.769\nyou know, all over the world,\n\n00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.944\nand I started thinking about\n\n00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:15.598\nwhat it does and what it doesn't do.\n\n00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:17.282\nAnd I realized something interesting:\n\n00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:21.485\nAvaz helps children with autism learn words.\n\n00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.890\nWhat it doesn't help them do is to learn\n\n00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.638\nword patterns.\n\n00:02:26.638 --> 00:02:29.110\nLet me explain this in a little more detail.\n\n00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.167\nTake this sentence: \"I want soup tonight.\"\n\n00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:36.247\nNow it's not just the words\nhere that convey the meaning.\n\n00:02:36.247 --> 00:02:39.387\nIt's also the way in which these words are arranged,\n\n00:02:39.387 --> 00:02:41.902\nthe way these words are modified and arranged.\n\n00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:44.223\nAnd that's why a sentence like \"I want soup tonight\"\n\n00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:46.207\nis different from a sentence like\n\n00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:49.519\n\"Soup want I tonight,\" which \nis completely meaningless.\n\n00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.138\nSo there is another hidden abstraction here\n\n00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.695\nwhich children with autism find\na lot of difficulty coping with,\n\n00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:58.535\nand that's the fact that you can modify words\n\n00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:00.636\nand you can arrange them to have\n\n00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:03.531\ndifferent meanings, to convey different ideas.\n\n00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:06.990\nNow, this is what we call grammar.\n\n00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.026\nAnd grammar is incredibly powerful,\n\n00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:12.183\nbecause grammar is this one component of language\n\n00:03:12.183 --> 00:03:15.672\nwhich takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have\n\n00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:20.203\nand allows us to convey an\ninfinite amount of information,\n\n00:03:20.203 --> 00:03:22.337\nan infinite amount of ideas.\n\n00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:24.339\nIt's the way in which you can put things together\n\n00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.507\nin order to convey anything you want to.\n\n00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.634\nAnd so after I developed Avaz,\n\n00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:30.202\nI worried for a very long time\n\n00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:34.112\nabout how I could give grammar \nto children with autism.\n\n00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:36.387\nThe solution came to me from\na very interesting perspective.\n\n00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:39.836\nI happened to chance upon a child with autism\n\n00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:41.945\nconversing with her mom,\n\n00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:44.039\nand this is what happened.\n\n00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.225\nCompletely out of the blue, very spontaneously,\n\n00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.688\nthe child got up and said, \"Eat.\"\n\n00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:50.458\nNow what was interesting was\n\n00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:54.702\nthe way in which the mom was trying to tease out\n\n00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:56.915\nthe meaning of what the child wanted to say\n\n00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:59.175\nby talking to her in questions.\n\n00:03:59.175 --> 00:04:01.768\nSo she asked, \"Eat what? Do \nyou want to eat ice cream?\n\n00:04:01.768 --> 00:04:03.880\nYou want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat?\n\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.193\nYou want to eat cream now? You\nwant to eat ice cream in the evening?\"\n\n00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:08.707\nAnd then it struck me that\n\n00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.735\nwhat the mother had done was something incredible.\n\n00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:12.729\nShe had been able to get that child to communicate\n\n00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.867\nan idea to her without grammar.\n\n00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:19.563\nAnd it struck me that maybe this is what\n\n00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:20.948\nI was looking for.\n\n00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:25.090\nInstead of arranging words in an order, in sequence,\n\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.262\nas a sentence, you arrange them\n\n00:04:27.262 --> 00:04:31.073\nin this map, where they're all linked together\n\n00:04:31.073 --> 00:04:33.216\nnot by placing them one after the other\n\n00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:36.500\nbut in questions, in question-answer pairs.\n\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.858\nAnd so if you do this, then what you're conveying\n\n00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:40.844\nis not a sentence in English,\n\n00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:43.810\nbut what you're conveying is really a meaning,\n\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.321\nthe meaning of a sentence in English.\n\n00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:48.253\nNow, meaning is really the underbelly,\nin some sense, of language.\n\n00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:52.074\nIt's what comes after thought but before language.\n\n00:04:52.074 --> 00:04:54.577\nAnd the idea was that this particular representation\n\n00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:57.838\nmight convey meaning in its raw form.\n\n00:04:57.838 --> 00:04:59.609\nSo I was very excited by this, you know,\n\n00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:01.102\nhopping around all over the place,\n\n00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:02.873\ntrying to figure out if I can convert\n\n00:05:02.873 --> 00:05:05.397\nall possible sentences that I hear into this.\n\n00:05:05.397 --> 00:05:07.170\nAnd I found that this is not enough.\n\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.555\nWhy is this not enough?\n\n00:05:08.555 --> 00:05:10.266\nThis is not enough because if you wanted to convey\n\n00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.516\nsomething like negation,\n\n00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:14.252\nyou want to say, \"I don't want soup,\"\n\n00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:16.472\nthen you can't do that by asking a question.\n\n00:05:16.472 --> 00:05:18.757\nYou do that by changing the word \"want.\"\n\n00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:20.394\nAgain, if you wanted to say,\n\n00:05:20.394 --> 00:05:22.374\n\"I wanted soup yesterday,\"\n\n00:05:22.374 --> 00:05:25.111\nyou do that by converting\nthe word \"want\" into \"wanted.\"\n\n00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:26.777\nIt's a past tense.\n\n00:05:26.777 --> 00:05:28.880\nSo this is a flourish which I added\n\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.456\nto make the system complete.\n\n00:05:30.456 --> 00:05:32.433\nThis is a map of words joined together\n\n00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:34.089\nas questions and answers,\n\n00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:36.353\nand with these filters applied on top of them\n\n00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:38.170\nin order to modify them to represent\n\n00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.879\ncertain nuances.\n\n00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.830\nLet me show you this with a different example.\n\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.084\nLet's take this sentence:\n\n00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:45.064\n\"I told the carpenter I could not pay him.\"\n\n00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:46.856\nIt's a fairly complicated sentence.\n\n00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:48.749\nThe way that this particular system works,\n\n00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:51.327\nyou can start with any part of this sentence.\n\n00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:53.025\nI'm going to start with the word \"tell.\"\n\n00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:54.487\nSo this is the word \"tell.\"\n\n00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.087\nNow this happened in the past,\n\n00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:58.310\nso I'm going to make that \"told.\"\n\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.018\nNow, what I'm going to do is,\n\n00:06:00.018 --> 00:06:01.774\nI'm going to ask questions.\n\n00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:04.138\nSo, who told? I told.\n\n00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:06.065\nI told whom? I told the carpenter.\n\n00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.816\nNow we start with a different part of the sentence.\n\n00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:09.683\nWe start with the word \"pay,\"\n\n00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:14.260\nand we add the ability filter to it to make it \"can pay.\"\n\n00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.361\nThen we make it \"can't pay,\"\n\n00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:17.960\nand we can make it \"couldn't pay\"\n\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.623\nby making it the past tense.\n\n00:06:19.623 --> 00:06:21.546\nSo who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay.\n\n00:06:21.546 --> 00:06:24.222\nCouldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter.\n\n00:06:24.222 --> 00:06:25.953\nAnd then you join these two together\n\n00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:27.303\nby asking this question:\n\n00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.040\nWhat did I tell the carpenter?\n\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.089\nI told the carpenter I could not pay him.\n\n00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:35.026\nNow think about this. This is\n\n00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:38.568\n\u2014(Applause)\u2014\n\n00:06:38.568 --> 00:06:42.240\nthis is a representation of this sentence\n\n00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.675\nwithout language.\n\n00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:46.867\nAnd there are two or three\ninteresting things about this.\n\n00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:49.998\nFirst of all, I could have started anywhere.\n\n00:06:49.998 --> 00:06:52.241\nI didn't have to start with the word \"tell.\"\n\n00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:53.657\nI could have started anywhere in the sentence,\n\n00:06:53.657 --> 00:06:55.164\nand I could have made this entire thing.\n\n00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:57.940\nThe second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker,\n\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.115\nif I was speaking in some other language,\n\n00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:03.271\nthis map would actually hold true in any language.\n\n00:07:03.271 --> 00:07:05.261\nSo long as the questions are standardized,\n\n00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:09.548\nthe map is actually independent of language.\n\n00:07:09.548 --> 00:07:11.663\nSo I call this FreeSpeech,\n\n00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:14.598\nand I was playing with this for many, many months.\n\n00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:17.324\nI was trying out so many\ndifferent combinations of this.\n\n00:07:17.324 --> 00:07:19.613\nAnd then I noticed something very\ninteresting about FreeSpeech.\n\n00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:22.856\nI was trying to convert language,\n\n00:07:22.856 --> 00:07:25.240\nconvert sentences in English\ninto sentences in FreeSpeech,\n\n00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.992\nand vice versa, and back and forth.\n\n00:07:26.992 --> 00:07:29.247\nAnd I realized that this particular configuration,\n\n00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:31.273\nthis particular way of representing language,\n\n00:07:31.273 --> 00:07:35.668\nit allowed me to actually create very concise rules\n\n00:07:35.668 --> 00:07:38.402\nthat go between FreeSpeech on one side\n\n00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:39.890\nand English on the other.\n\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.070\nSo I could actually write this set of rules\n\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.465\nthat translates from this particular\nrepresentation into English.\n\n00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.296\nAnd so I developed this thing.\n\n00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:49.528\nI developed this thing called \nthe FreeSpeech Engine\n\n00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:52.089\nwhich takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input\n\n00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:56.019\nand gives out perfectly grammatical English text.\n\n00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:57.624\nAnd by putting these two pieces together,\n\n00:07:57.624 --> 00:07:59.505\nthe representation and the engine,\n\n00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:03.301\nI was able to create an app, a\ntechnology for children with autism,\n\n00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:05.800\nthat not only gives them words\n\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.741\nbut also gives them grammar.\n\n00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:12.101\nSo I tried this out with kids with autism,\n\n00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:17.114\nand I found that there was an \nincredible amount of identification.\n\n00:08:17.114 --> 00:08:19.834\nThey were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech\n\n00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:22.392\nwhich were much more complicated\nbut much more effective\n\n00:08:22.392 --> 00:08:25.291\nthan equivalent sentences in English,\n\n00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:26.973\nand I started thinking about\n\n00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.942\nwhy that might be the case.\n\n00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:33.229\nAnd I had an idea, and I want to \ntalk to you about this idea next.\n\n00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:36.371\nIn about 1997, about 15 years back,\n\n00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:38.382\nthere were a group of scientists that were trying\n\n00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:40.771\nto understand how the brain processes language,\n\n00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.550\nand they found something very interesting.\n\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.422\nThey found that when you learn a language\n\n00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:47.334\nas a child, as a two-year-old,\n\n00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:49.700\nyou learn it with a certain part of your brain,\n\n00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.300\nand when you learn a language as an adult --\n\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.211\nfor example, if I wanted to\nlearn Japanese right now \u2014\n\n00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:57.918\na completely different part of my brain is used.\n\n00:08:57.918 --> 00:08:59.749\nNow I don't know why that's the case,\n\n00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:01.740\nbut my guess is that that's because\n\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.177\nwhen you learn a language as an adult,\n\n00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:05.793\nyou almost invariably learn it\n\n00:09:05.793 --> 00:09:10.059\nthrough your native language, or\nthrough your first language.\n\n00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:13.311\nSo what's interesting about FreeSpeech\n\n00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:15.113\nis that when you create a sentence\n\n00:09:15.113 --> 00:09:16.808\nor when you create language,\n\n00:09:16.808 --> 00:09:19.878\na child with autism creates\nlanguage with FreeSpeech,\n\n00:09:19.878 --> 00:09:21.711\nthey're not using this support language,\n\n00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:23.922\nthey're not using this bridge language.\n\n00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:26.579\nThey're directly constructing the sentence.\n\n00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:28.772\nAnd so this gave me this idea.\n\n00:09:28.772 --> 00:09:30.796\nIs it possible to use FreeSpeech\n\n00:09:30.796 --> 00:09:33.306\nnot for children with autism\n\n00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:39.568\nbut to teach language to people without disabilities?\n\n00:09:39.568 --> 00:09:41.546\nAnd so I tried a number of experiments.\n\n00:09:41.546 --> 00:09:44.494\nThe first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle\n\n00:09:44.494 --> 00:09:46.464\nin which these questions and answers\n\n00:09:46.464 --> 00:09:48.299\nare coded in the form of shapes,\n\n00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:49.437\nin the form of colors,\n\n00:09:49.437 --> 00:09:51.286\nand you have people putting these together\n\n00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:53.059\nand trying to understand how this works.\n\n00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.435\nAnd I built an app out of it, a game out of it,\n\n00:09:55.435 --> 00:09:58.096\nin which children can play with words\n\n00:09:58.096 --> 00:09:59.800\nand with a reinforcement,\n\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.385\na sound reinforcement of visual structures,\n\n00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:04.398\nthey're able to learn language.\n\n00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:07.134\nAnd this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise,\n\n00:10:07.134 --> 00:10:09.109\nand the government of India recently\n\n00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.513\nlicensed this technology from us,\n\n00:10:10.513 --> 00:10:12.587\nand they're going to try it out\nwith millions of different children\n\n00:10:12.587 --> 00:10:15.192\ntrying to teach them English.\n\n00:10:15.192 --> 00:10:17.806\nAnd the dream, the hope, the vision, really,\n\n00:10:17.806 --> 00:10:20.888\nis that when they learn English this way,\n\n00:10:20.888 --> 00:10:23.531\nthey learn it with the same proficiency\n\n00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:27.249\nas their mother tongue.\n\n00:10:27.249 --> 00:10:31.065\nAll right, let's talk about something else.\n\n00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:33.062\nLet's talk about speech.\n\n00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:34.333\nThis is speech.\n\n00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.295\nSo speech is the primary mode of communication\n\n00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:37.908\ndelivered between all of us.\n\n00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:39.763\nNow what's interesting about speech is that\n\n00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:41.008\nspeech is one-dimensional.\n\n00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:42.367\nWhy is it one-dimensional?\n\n00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:43.935\nIt's one-dimensional because it's sound.\n\n00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.474\nIt's also one-dimensional because\n\n00:10:45.474 --> 00:10:46.679\nour mouths are built that way.\n\n00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:50.191\nOur mouths are built to create\none-dimensional sound.\n\n00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.057\nBut if you think about the brain,\n\n00:10:53.057 --> 00:10:54.821\nthe thoughts that we have in our heads\n\n00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.923\nare not one-dimensional.\n\n00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:58.382\nI mean, we have these rich,\n\n00:10:58.382 --> 00:11:01.410\ncomplicated, multi-dimensional ideas.\n\n00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.100\nNow, it seems to me that language\n\n00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.432\nis really the brain's invention\n\n00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:08.528\nto convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought\n\n00:11:08.528 --> 00:11:10.115\non one hand\n\n00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:12.038\ninto speech on the other hand.\n\n00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.800\nNow what's interesting is that\n\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.368\nwe do a lot of work in information nowadays,\n\n00:11:16.368 --> 00:11:19.447\nand almost all of that is done\nin the language domain.\n\n00:11:19.447 --> 00:11:21.386\nTake Google, for example.\n\n00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:24.063\nGoogle trawls all these\ncountless billions of websites,\n\n00:11:24.063 --> 00:11:26.788\nall of which are in English,\nand when you want to use Google,\n\n00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:29.238\nyou go into Google search, and you type in English,\n\n00:11:29.238 --> 00:11:33.401\nand it matches the English with the English.\n\n00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.984\nWhat if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead?\n\n00:11:36.984 --> 00:11:39.285\nI have a suspicion that if we did this,\n\n00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:41.353\nwe'd find that algorithms like searching,\n\n00:11:41.353 --> 00:11:43.678\nlike retrieval, all of these things,\n\n00:11:43.678 --> 00:11:46.753\nare much simpler and also more effective,\n\n00:11:46.753 --> 00:11:51.170\nbecause they don't process\nthe data structure of speech.\n\n00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:57.146\nInstead they're processing\nthe data structure of thought.\n\n00:11:57.146 --> 00:11:59.954\nThe data structure of thought.\n\n00:11:59.954 --> 00:12:02.030\nThat's a provocative idea.\n\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.172\nBut let's look at this in a little more detail.\n\n00:12:04.172 --> 00:12:06.538\nSo this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem.\n\n00:12:06.538 --> 00:12:09.422\nWe have the Free Speech\nrepresentation on one side,\n\n00:12:09.422 --> 00:12:11.650\nand we have the FreeSpeech \nEngine, which generates English.\n\n00:12:11.652 --> 00:12:13.377\nNow if you think about it,\n\n00:12:13.377 --> 00:12:15.921\nFreeSpeech, I told you, is completely \nlanguage-independent.\n\n00:12:15.921 --> 00:12:18.008\nIt doesn't have any specific information in it\n\n00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:19.236\nwhich is about English.\n\n00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:22.036\nSo everything that this system knows about English\n\n00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:26.656\nis actually encoded into the engine.\n\n00:12:26.656 --> 00:12:28.893\nThat's a pretty interesting concept in itself.\n\n00:12:28.893 --> 00:12:32.497\nYou've encoded an entire human language\n\n00:12:32.497 --> 00:12:35.142\ninto a software program.\n\n00:12:35.142 --> 00:12:37.673\nBut if you look at what's inside the engine,\n\n00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:40.031\nit's actually not very complicated.\n\n00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:42.136\nIt's not very complicated code.\n\n00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.808\nAnd what's more interesting is the fact that\n\n00:12:44.808 --> 00:12:47.011\nthe vast majority of the code in that engine\n\n00:12:47.011 --> 00:12:49.423\nis not really English-specific.\n\n00:12:49.423 --> 00:12:51.318\nAnd that gives this interesting idea.\n\n00:12:51.318 --> 00:12:53.356\nIt might be very easy for us to actually\n\n00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:57.182\ncreate these engines in many,\nmany different languages,\n\n00:12:57.182 --> 00:13:03.536\nin Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili.\n\n00:13:03.536 --> 00:13:06.335\nAnd that gives another interesting idea.\n\n00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:08.989\nFor example, supposing I was a writer,\n\n00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:11.111\nsay, for a newspaper or for a magazine.\n\n00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:16.122\nI could create content in one language, FreeSpeech,\n\n00:13:16.122 --> 00:13:18.178\nand the person who's consuming that content,\n\n00:13:18.178 --> 00:13:21.239\nthe person who's reading that particular information\n\n00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:23.734\ncould choose any engine,\n\n00:13:23.734 --> 00:13:26.470\nand they could read it in their own mother tongue,\n\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.409\nin their native language.\n\n00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:33.131\nI mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea,\n\n00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:35.130\nespecially for India.\n\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.820\nWe have so many different languages.\n\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.962\nThere's a song about India, and there's a description\n\n00:13:38.962 --> 00:13:41.306\nof the country as, it says,\n\n00:13:41.306 --> 00:13:43.666\n(in Sanskrit).\n\n00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:46.439\nThat means \"ever-smiling speaker\n\n00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:50.958\nof beautiful languages.\"\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.922\nLanguage is beautiful.\n\n00:13:52.922 --> 00:13:55.376\nI think it's the most beautiful of human creations.\n\n00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:59.354\nI think it's the loveliest thing\nthat our brains have invented.\n\n00:13:59.354 --> 00:14:02.938\nIt entertains, it educates, it enlightens,\n\n00:14:02.938 --> 00:14:04.982\nbut what I like the most about language\n\n00:14:04.982 --> 00:14:06.482\nis that it empowers.\n\n00:14:06.482 --> 00:14:08.320\nI want to leave you with this.\n\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.705\nThis is a photograph of my collaborators,\n\n00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:11.702\nmy earliest collaborators\n\n00:14:11.702 --> 00:14:13.164\nwhen I started working on language\n\n00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:14.666\nand autism and various other things.\n\n00:14:14.666 -->

In 2010, I had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department. This was my moment to lean in, to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs, and I had just finished a big, 18-month project for Secretary Clinton, successfully, and I knew I could handle a bigger job.The woman I thought I was would have said yes. But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton, New Jersey, where my husband and my two teenage sons lived, and it was not going well. I tried on the idea of eking out another two years in Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me. But deep down, I knew that the right decision was to go home, even if I didn't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice.That was a decision based on love and responsibility. I couldn't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me. But the real change came more gradually. Over the next year, while my family was righting itself, I started to realize that even if I could go back into government, I didn't want to. I didn't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home. I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me, not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want, and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed.I am still completely committed to the cause of male-female equality, but let's think about what that equality really means, and how best to achieve it. I always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers, so that the measure of male-female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions: prime ministers, presidents, CEOs, directors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders. I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal. But that's only half of real equality, and I now think we're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half. I suggest that real equality, full equality, does not just mean valuing women on male terms. It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men. And to get there, we have to change our workplaces, our policies and our culture.In the workplace, real equality means valuing family just as much as work, and understanding that the two reinforce each other. As a leader and as a manager, I have always acted on the mantra, if family comes first, work does not come second \u2014 life comes together. If you work for me, and you have a family issue, I expect you to attend to it, and I am confident, and my confidence has always been borne out, that the work will get done, and done better. Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused, more efficient, more results-focused. And breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts. Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents. He's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office. And caregiving itself develops patience \u2014 a lot of patience \u2014 and empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability. Those are all attributes that are ever more important in a high-speed, horizontal, networked global economy.The best companies actually know this. The companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the United States include some of our most successful corporations, and a 2008 national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work, they're more satisfied and more loyal, they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health. And a 2012 study of employers showed that deep, flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy.So you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an American problem. Sadly, though, the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely American disease. Twenty years ago, when my family first started going to Italy, we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta. Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day. It's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch. Now, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta, reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24-hour competition. So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative.In policy terms, real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done, no matter who does it. Think about it: Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival. At least if we get beyond a barter economy, somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones.Now most of you, when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving, instinctively translate those categories into men's work and women's work. And we don't typically challenge why men's work is advantaged. But consider a same-sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily. They're psychiatrists. They got married five years ago, and now they have two-year-old twins. They love being mothers, but they also love their work, and they're really good at what they do. So how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities? Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home? Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules? And what criteria should they use to make that decision? Is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career? Or who has the most flexible boss?The same-sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women's problems, they're family problems. And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones, because they have a choice about how much they want to work. Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need, and many of those workers are scrambling. They're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe. If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal, then why shouldn't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy?The governments that get it \u2014 no surprises here \u2014 the governments that get it, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, provide universal child care, support for caregivers at home, school and early childhood education, protections for pregnant women, and care for the elderly and the disabled. Those governments invest in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains. Those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other. They routinely rank among the top 15 countries of the most globally competitive economies, but at the same time, they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index. In fact, they rank higher than other governments, like my own, the U.S., or Switzerland, that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work-life balance.So changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference, but we're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture, and the kind of cultural change required means re-socializing men. (Applause) Increasingly in developed countries, women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home, but men are actually still where they always were. Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners, that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder. The feminist revolution still has a long way to go. It's certainly not complete. But 60 years after \"The Feminine Mystique\" was published, many women actually have more choices than men do. We can decide to be a breadwinner, a caregiver, or any combination of the two. When a man, on the other hand, decides to be a caregiver, he puts his manhood on the line. His friends may praise his decision, but underneath, they're scratching their heads. Isn't the measure of a man his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige? And as many women hold that view as men do. We know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career. A woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner. For a man, that's a risky proposition. So as parents and partners, we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be, either caregivers or breadwinners. We should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys. (Applause)I can almost hear lots of you thinking, \"No way.\" But in fact, the change is  actually already happening. At least in the United States, lots of men take pride in cooking, and frankly obsess over stoves. They are in the birthing rooms. They take paternity leave when they can. They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can, and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework. Indeed, there are male college students now who are starting to say, \"I want to be a stay-at-home dad.\" That was completely unthinkable 50 or even 30 years ago. And in Norway, where men have an automatic three month's paternity leave, but they lose it if they decide not to take it, a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact take their leave when they had kids. That means that it's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father.So I was raised to believe that championing women's rights meant doing everything we could to get women to the top. And I still hope that I live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force. But I've come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work, and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do.Thirty years ago, Carol Gilligan, a wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care, an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice. It turns out that \"you don't care\" is just as much a part of who we are as \"that's not fair.\" Bill Gates agrees. He argues that the two great forces of human nature are self-interest and caring for others. Let's bring them both together. Let's make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution. As whole human beings, we will be better caregivers and breadwinners. You may think that can't happen, but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties, where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms, and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual. Today, not so much. The revolution for human equality can happen. It is happening. It will happen. How far and how fast is up to us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1943, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:14.830\nSo my moment of

high-speed, horizontal,\n\n00:05:44.267 --> 00:05:48.716\nnetworked global economy.\n\n00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:51.904\nThe best companies actually know this.\n\n00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.631\nThe companies that win awards\n\n00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:56.883\nfor workplace flexibility in the United States\n\n00:05:56.883 --> 00:06:00.109\ninclude some of our most successful corporations,\n\n00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.380\nand a 2008 national study\n\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.433\non the changing workforce\n\n00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:06.047\nshowed that employees\n\n00:06:06.047 --> 00:06:09.549\nin flexible and effective workplaces\n\n00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:11.262\nare more engaged with their work,\n\n00:06:11.262 --> 00:06:13.752\nthey're more satisfied and more loyal,\n\n00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:15.585\nthey have lower levels of stress\n\n00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.984\nand higher levels of mental health.\n\n00:06:17.984 --> 00:06:21.694\nAnd a 2012 study of employers\n\n00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:24.547\nshowed that deep, flexible practices\n\n00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:26.937\nactually lowered operating costs\n\n00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:29.402\nand increased adaptability\n\n00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:32.489\nin a global service economy.\n\n00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:35.606\nSo you may think\n\n00:06:35.606 --> 00:06:39.823\nthat the privileging of work over family\n\n00:06:39.823 --> 00:06:43.770\nis only an American problem.\n\n00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.308\nSadly, though, the obsession with work\n\n00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:50.468\nis no longer a uniquely American disease.\n\n00:06:50.468 --> 00:06:52.240\nTwenty years ago,\n\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.236\nwhen my family first started going to Italy,\n\n00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:57.839\nwe used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.\n\n00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.722\nSiesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.\n\n00:07:00.722 --> 00:07:02.588\nIt's actually just as much\n\n00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:05.700\nabout embracing the warmth of a family lunch.\n\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.903\nNow, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses\n\n00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:10.616\nclose for siesta,\n\n00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:14.154\nreflecting the advance of global corporations\n\n00:07:14.154 --> 00:07:16.991\nand 24-hour competition.\n\n00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:19.860\nSo making a place for those we love\n\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.605\nis actually a global imperative.\n\n00:07:23.605 --> 00:07:26.335\nIn policy terms,\n\n00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:29.771\nreal equality means recognizing\n\n00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:32.729\nthat the work that women have traditionally done\n\n00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.606\nis just as important\n\n00:07:34.606 --> 00:07:37.269\nas the work that men have traditionally done,\n\n00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:40.321\nno matter who does it.\n\n00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:44.066\nThink about it: Breadwinning and caregiving\n\n00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:47.591\nare equally necessary for human survival.\n\n00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:51.075\nAt least if we get beyond a barter economy,\n\n00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:53.312\nsomebody has to earn an income\n\n00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:56.266\nand someone else has to convert that income\n\n00:07:56.266 --> 00:08:00.050\nto care and sustenance for loved ones.\n\n00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.188\nNow most of you, when you hear me\n\n00:08:02.188 --> 00:08:04.913\ntalk about breadwinning and caregiving,\n\n00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:08.354\ninstinctively translate those categories\n\n00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:12.085\ninto men's work and women's work.\n\n00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:14.921\nAnd we don't typically challenge\n\n00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:18.819\nwhy men's work is advantaged.\n\n00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:21.409\nBut consider a same-sex couple\n\n00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:23.428\nlike my friends Sarah and Emily.\n\n00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:25.296\nThey're psychiatrists.\n\n00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.125\nThey got married five years ago,\n\n00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:30.406\nand now they have two-year-old twins.\n\n00:08:30.406 --> 00:08:32.478\nThey love being mothers,\n\n00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:34.046\nbut they also love their work,\n\n00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:36.256\nand they're really good at what they do.\n\n00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:38.277\nSo how are they going to divide up\n\n00:08:38.277 --> 00:08:40.754\nbreadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?\n\n00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:42.839\nShould one of them stop working\n\n00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:45.531\nor reduce hours to be home?\n\n00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:48.210\nOr should they both change their practices\n\n00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.493\nso they can have much more flexible schedules?\n\n00:08:51.493 --> 00:08:53.464\nAnd what criteria should they use\n\n00:08:53.464 --> 00:08:54.758\nto make that decision?\n\n00:08:54.758 --> 00:08:56.532\nIs it who makes the most money\n\n00:08:56.532 --> 00:09:00.309\nor who is most committed to her career?\n\n00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:04.870\nOr who has the most flexible boss?\n\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.195\nThe same-sex perspective helps us see\n\n00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:10.659\nthat juggling work and family\n\n00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:12.770\nare not women's problems,\n\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.408\nthey're family problems.\n\n00:09:15.408 --> 00:09:18.431\nAnd Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,\n\n00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:20.200\nbecause they have a choice\n\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.737\nabout how much they want to work.\n\n00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:25.566\nMillions of men and women\n\n00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:28.903\nhave to be both breadwinners and caregivers\n\n00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:32.443\njust to earn the income they need,\n\n00:09:32.443 --> 00:09:34.991\nand many of those workers are scrambling.\n\n00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.875\nThey're patching together care arrangements\n\n00:09:37.875 --> 00:09:39.048\nthat are inadequate\n\n00:09:39.048 --> 00:09:41.459\nand often actually unsafe.\n\n00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:46.149\nIf breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,\n\n00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:47.737\nthen why shouldn't a government\n\n00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:51.553\ninvest as much in an infrastructure of care\n\n00:09:51.553 --> 00:09:55.412\nas the foundation of a healthy society\n\n00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:58.524\nas it invests in physical infrastructure\n\n00:09:58.524 --> 00:10:02.400\nas the backbone of a successful economy?\n\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.736\nThe governments that get it --\n\n00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:06.583\nno surprises here --\n\n00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:08.423\nthe governments that get it,\n\n00:10:08.423 --> 00:10:13.128\nNorway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,\n\n00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:16.058\nprovide universal child care,\n\n00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:18.177\nsupport for caregivers at home,\n\n00:10:18.177 --> 00:10:21.344\nschool and early childhood education,\n\n00:10:21.344 --> 00:10:23.554\nprotections for pregnant women,\n\n00:10:23.554 --> 00:10:27.939\nand care for the elderly and the disabled.\n\n00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:31.620\nThose governments invest in that infrastructure\n\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.949\nthe same way they invest in roads and bridges\n\n00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:38.084\nand tunnels and trains.\n\n00:10:38.084 --> 00:10:40.492\nThose societies also show you\n\n00:10:40.492 --> 00:10:42.782\nthat breadwinning and caregiving\n\n00:10:42.782 --> 00:10:45.166\nreinforce each other.\n\n00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:51.005\nThey routinely rank among the top 15 countries\n\n00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:54.338\nof the most globally competitive economies,\n\n00:10:54.338 --> 00:10:55.990\nbut at the same time,\n\n00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.681\nthey rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.\n\n00:11:00.681 --> 00:11:04.217\nIn fact, they rank higher than other governments,\n\n00:11:04.217 --> 00:11:06.886\nlike my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,\n\n00:11:06.886 --> 00:11:09.815\nthat have higher average levels of income\n\n00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:15.578\nbut lower rankings on work-life balance.\n\n00:11:15.578 --> 00:11:18.254\nSo changing our workplaces\n\n00:11:18.254 --> 00:11:21.550\nand building infrastructures of care\n\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.025\nwould make a big difference,\n\n00:11:23.025 --> 00:11:27.509\nbut we're not going to get equally valued choices\n\n00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:30.014\nunless we change our culture,\n\n00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:33.155\nand the kind of cultural change required\n\n00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:35.910\nmeans re-socializing men.\n\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.584\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:39.584 --> 00:11:41.319\nIncreasingly in developed countries,\n\n00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:44.401\nwomen are socialized to believe that our place\n\n00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:48.061\nis no longer only in the home,\n\n00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:52.957\nbut men are actually still where they always were.\n\n00:11:52.957 --> 00:11:56.355\nMen are still socialized to believe\n\n00:11:56.355 --> 00:11:58.610\nthat they have to be breadwinners,\n\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.485\nthat to derive their self-worth\n\n00:12:01.485 --> 00:12:04.364\nfrom how high they can climb over other men\n\n00:12:04.364 --> 00:12:06.709\non a career ladder.\n\n00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:09.492\nThe feminist revolution still has a long way to go.\n\n00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:11.394\nIt's certainly not complete.\n\n00:12:11.394 --> 00:12:13.050\nBut 60 years after\n\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.360\n\"The Feminine\nMystique\" was published,\n\n00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.661\nmany women actually have\n\n00:12:17.661 --> 00:12:20.639\nmore choices than men do.\n\n00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.367\nWe can decide to be a breadwinner,\n\n00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:27.514\na caregiver, or any combination of the two.\n\n00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:30.040\nWhen a man, on the other hand,\n\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.929\ndecides to be a caregiver,\n\n00:12:32.929 --> 00:12:36.233\nhe puts his manhood on the line.\n\n00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:39.453\nHis friends may praise his decision,\n\n00:12:39.453 --> 00:12:43.325\nbut underneath, they're scratching their heads.\n\n00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:46.426\nIsn't the measure of a man\n\n00:12:46.426 --> 00:12:49.357\nhis willingness to compete with other men\n\n00:12:49.357 --> 00:12:51.737\nfor power and prestige?\n\n00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:55.833\nAnd as many women hold that view as men do.\n\n00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:58.799\nWe know that lots of women\n\n00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:02.118\nstill judge the attractiveness of a man\n\n00:13:02.118 --> 00:13:04.843\nbased in large part on how successful he is\n\n00:13:04.843 --> 00:13:06.340\nin his career.\n\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.691\nA woman can drop out of the work force\n\n00:13:08.691 --> 00:13:10.851\nand still be an attractive partner.\n\n00:13:10.851 --> 00:13:15.390\nFor a man, that's a risky proposition.\n\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.631\nSo as parents and partners,\n\n00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.818\nwe should be socializing our sons\n\n00:13:20.818 --> 00:13:23.269\nand our husbands\n\n00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:26.593\nto be whatever they want to be,\n\n00:13:26.593 --> 00:13:30.212\neither caregivers or breadwinners.\n\n00:13:30.212 --> 00:13:33.568\nWe should be socializing them to make caregiving\n\n00:13:33.568 --> 00:13:35.555\ncool for guys.\n\n00:13:35.555 --> 00:13:39.320\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.632\nI can almost hear lots of you thinking, \"No way.\"\n\n00:13:45.632 --> 00:13:50.279\nBut in fact, the change is \nactually already happening.\n\n00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:52.236\nAt least in the United States,\n\n00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:54.460\nlots of men take pride in cooking,\n\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.776\nand frankly obsess over stoves.\n\n00:13:57.776 --> 00:14:00.763\nThey are in the birthing rooms.\n\n00:14:00.763 --> 00:14:03.407\nThey take paternity leave when they can.\n\n00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:05.869\nThey can walk a baby or soothe a toddler\n\n00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:08.511\njust as well as their wives can,\n\n00:14:08.511 --> 00:14:10.260\nand they are increasingly\n\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.827\ndoing much more of the housework.\n\n00:14:12.827 --> 00:14:14.915\nIndeed, there are male college students now\n\n00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:16.442\nwho are starting to say,\n\n00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:18.318\n\"I want to be a stay-at-home dad.\"\n\n00:14:18.318 --> 00:14:20.569\nThat was completely unthinkable\n\n00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:23.436\n50 or even 30 years ago.\n\n00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:26.327\nAnd in Norway, where men have\n\n00:14:26.327 --> 00:14:29.116\nan automatic three month's paternity leave,\n\n00:14:29.116 --> 00:14:32.453\nbut they lose it if they decide not to take it,\n\n00:14:32.453 --> 00:14:34.378\na high government official told me\n\n00:14:34.378 --> 00:14:36.610\nthat companies are starting to look\n\n00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.695\nat prospective male employees\n\n00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:42.673\nand raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact\n\n00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.069\ntake their leave when they had kids.\n\n00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:47.898\nThat means that it's starting to seem\n\n00:14:47.898 --> 00:14:50.100\nlike a character defect\n\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.320\nnot to want to be a fully engaged father.\n\n00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:02.901\nSo I was raised\n\n00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.550\nto believe that championing women's rights\n\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.669\nmeant doing everything we could\n\n00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:10.443\nto get women to the top.\n\n00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:13.162\nAnd I still hope that I live long enough\n\n00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.425\nto see men and women

00:15:26.403\nevery bit as much as we value work,\n\n00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:28.915\nand that we should entertain the idea\n\n00:15:28.915 --> 00:15:32.464\nthat doing right by those we love\n\n00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:36.380\nwill make all of us better at everything we do.\n\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.448\nThirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,\n\n00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:41.405\na wonderful

Who has an Android phone? Who has a Blackberry? Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry? (Laughter)And let me guess, how many of you, when you arrived here, like me, went and bought a pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah? I'll bet you didn't even know you're using African technology. Pay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea, pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom a good 15 years ago, and now, like franchising, pay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces of economic activity in the world.So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa, which I think is the purest form, innovation out of necessity. But first, I'm going to ask you some other questions. You don't have to put your hands up. These are rhetorical.Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the city that we're in?Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line to produce these Fords that came in anything as long as they were black?And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos? Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like, and in the background, you can see Robben Island. This is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield is the most famous inventor you've never heard of. In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London, and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse, he had the idea for this. It's a bit like a huge jumping jack, and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater. The global shipping economy would not be possible without African technology like this.So whenever you talk about Africa, you have to put up this picture of the world from space, and people go, \"Look, it's the Dark Continent.\" Actually, it isn't. What it is is a map of innovation. And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on. All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't. (Laughter) (Applause) And the reason it isn't is because everybody's watching television or playing Angry Birds. (Laughter) (Applause)So where it's happening is in Africa. Now, this is real innovation, not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products. This is real innovation, and I define it as problem-solving. People are solving real problems in Africa. Why? Because we have to. Because we have real problems. And when we solve real problems for people, we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time.So in California, everybody's really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card, and people say, \"We've liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal.\" Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card? In Africa, we've been doing that for years, and we've been doing it on phones like this. This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela, about an hour south of Nairobi, and the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system that's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa is that it works on phones like this. It works on every single phone possible, because it uses SMS. You can pay bills with it,  you can buy your groceries, you can pay your kids' school fees, and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials. (Laughter) Something like 25 million dollars a day is transacted through M-Pesa. Forty percent of Kenya's GDP moves through M-Pesa using phones like this.And you think this is just a feature phone. Actually it's the smartphone of Africa. It's also a radio, and it's also a torch, and more than anything else, it has really superb battery life. Why? Because that's what we need. We have really severe energy problems in Africa. By the way, you can update Facebook and send Gmail from a phone like this.So we have found a way to use the available technology to send money via M-Pesa, which is a bit like a check system for the mobile age. I come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town. It's built on gold. This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier. And the difference today is that  the gold of today is mobile. If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked, first came the infrastructure, then came the industry around it, the brothels \u2014 it's a bit like the Internet today, right? \u2014 and everything else that worked with it: bars, saloons, etc. The gold of today is mobile, and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible.So what are some of the things that you can do with it? Well, this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana, and what you do is you take medication, something that some people might spend their entire month's salary on, and you scratch off the code, and you send that to an SMS number, and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it's expired. Really simple, really effective, really life-saving. In Kenya, there's a service called iCow, which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy. The dairy business in Kenya is a $463 million business, and the difference between a subsistence farmer and an abundance farmer is only a couple of liters of milk a day. And if you can do that, you can rise out of poverty. Really simple, using a basic phone. If you don't have electricity, no problem! We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did. There's another great African that you've heard that's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world. He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power and the electricity industry in North America, and if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars, hopefully in my lifetime. He comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa], about 50 kilometers from where I live. So back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli, which means City of Gold. And not only is mobile the gold of today, I don't believe that the gold is under the ground. I believe we are the gold. Like you've heard the other economists say, we are at the point where China was when its boom years began, and that's where we're going.So, you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge. Well, of course it's happening at the edge, because in the middle, everybody's updating Facebook, or worse still, they're trying to understand Facebook's privacy settings. (Laughter) This is not that catchy catchphrase. This is innovation over the edge.So, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent, but actually it's mobile-only, so while everybody else is doing all of those things, we're solving the world's problems. So there's only one thing left to say.[\"You're welcome\"] (Laughter)(Applause)", "id": 1944, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.059\nLet me start by asking you a\nquestion, just with a show of hands:\n\n00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.194\nWho has an iPhone?\n\n00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:20.284\nWho has an Android phone?\n\n00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:22.352\nWho has a Blackberry?\n\n00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.726\nWho will admit in public to having a Blackberry?\n\n00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:27.309\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:29.397\nAnd let me guess, how many of you,\n\n00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:31.405\nwhen you arrived here, like me, went and bought\n\n00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:35.195\na pay-as-you-go SIM card?

(Laughter) Yeah, you did. Thank you for putting your hand up over there. Well, I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. I'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex.Now, when humans think about sex, male and female forms are generally what come to mind, but for many millions of years, such specific categories didn't even exist. Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. It wasn't until about 500 million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out, and a vagina, something that receives it. Now invariably, you're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species, these very familiar structures, but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing.Penile diversity is especially profuse. So this is a paper nautilus. It's a close relative of squid and octopus, and males have a hectocotylus. Just what is a hectocotylus? A detachable, swimming penis. It leaves the [body of the male], finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water, attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm. For many decades, biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether. Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America. And the tapir has a prehensile penis. It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands. And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus, not to mention it's a pretty good size. The biggest penis in the animal kingdom, however, is not that of the tapir. The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle, and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle. (Laughter) Mm-hm. (Laughter)So with all of this diversity in structure, one might think, then, that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction. Simply insert part A into slot B, and we should all be good to go. But of course, that doesn't exactly happen, and that's because we can't just take form into account. We have to think about function as well, and when it comes to sex, function relates to the contributions made by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs. And these contributions are far from equal. Eggs are very expensive to make, so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with. Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap, so it makes more sense for males to have a more-sex-is-better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations.So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes? I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male, or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough, then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things: avoiding predators, taking care of offspring, gathering and ingesting food. This is, of course, bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank, and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization. This is bedbug sex, and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination. Males have a spiked, barbed penis that they literally stab into the female, and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina. They stab it anywhere in her body, and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries. If a female gets too many stab wounds, or if a stab wound happens to become infected, she can actually die from it.Now if you've ever been out for a nice, peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex, you've undoubtedly been alarmed, because it looks like gang rape. And quite frankly, that's exactly what it is. A group of males will grab a female, hold her down, and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis into her corkscrew-shaped vagina over and over and over again. From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second. Now the female actually gets the last laugh, though, because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries.Now, I like to share stories like this with my audiences because, yeah, we humans, we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good, there's romance, and there's orgasm. But orgasm didn't actually evolve until about 65 million years ago with the advent of mammals. But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that. There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner.Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones. It's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different. Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all. So going back to our biological minds, then, we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages, because she can use her time for other things: avoiding predators, taking care of young, finding and ingesting food. But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages. Why do they do this? Well, according to the biological literature, \"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract.\" Mm-hm.These are Mexican guppies, and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments, and these filaments basically form a fish mustache, if you will. Now males have been observed to prod the female's genital opening prior to copulating with her, and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis, females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches. A little guppy porn for you right there.So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner. We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex. We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner. Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom, it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again. It's very common in many phyla, from invertebrates to avian species, mammals, and, of course, even in primates.Now interestingly, there  are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place. Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris, or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally, much like a penis, and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina, she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside-out it in her own body. I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis. It's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action. Now, even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal: they're run by females, groups of females, sisters, aunts and offspring, and when young males attain sexual maturity, they're turfed out of the group. In hyena societies, adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. They can take part in a kill only after everybody else, including the offspring. So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male, you take away all the social power he has.So what are my take-home messages from my talk today? Well, sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere. The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other, which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve.So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals, including ourselves, spend a good amount of time thinking about sex, but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it.So thank you, and happy daydreaming.(Applause)", "id": 1945, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:15.330\nAnyone in the room thought about sex today?\n\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.490\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.695\nYeah, you did.\n\n00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.161\nThank you for putting your hand up over there.\n\n00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.881\nWell, I'm here to provide you with\n\n00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.576\nsome biological validation\n\n00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:25.006\nfor your sordid daydreams.\n\n00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:26.400\nI'm here to tell you a few things\n\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.906\nthat you might not have known about wild sex.\n\n00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:31.754\nNow, when humans think about sex,\n\n00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:33.484\nmale and female forms\n\n00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:35.155\nare generally what come to mind,\n\n00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:37.608\nbut for many millions of years,\n\n00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:40.229\nsuch specific categories didn't even exist.\n\n00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:42.832\nSex was a mere fusion of bodies\n\n00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.442\nor a trickle of DNA\n\n00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:46.984\nshared between two or more beings.\n\n00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.309\nIt wasn't until about 500 million years ago\n\n00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.673\nthat we start to see structures akin to a penis\n\n00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:55.331\nor a thing that gives DNA out,\n\n00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:58.485\nand a vagina, something that receives it.\n\n00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:00.810\nNow invariably, you're probably thinking about\n\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.230\nwhat belongs to our own species,\n\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.128\nthese very familiar structures,\n\n00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:07.414\nbut the diversity that we see in sexual structures\n\n00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:09.402\nin the animal kingdom that has evolved\n\n00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.050\nin response to the multitude of factors\n\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.711\nsurrounding reproduction\n\n00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:16.105\nis pretty mind-blowing.\n\n00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:19.746\nPenile diversity is especially profuse.\n\n00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.891\nSo this is a paper nautilus.\n\n00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:24.801\nIt's a close relative of squid and octopus,\n\n00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.923\nand males have a hectocotylus.\n\n00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:29.673\nJust what is a hectocotylus?\n\n00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:33.852\nA detachable, swimming penis.\n\n00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:36.261\nIt leaves the [body of the male],\n\n00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:39.461\nfinds the female through\npheromonal cues in the water,\n\n00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:41.372\nattaches itself to her body\n\n00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:42.680\nand deposits the sperm.\n\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.204\nFor many decades, biologists actually felt\n\n00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:49.649\nthat the hectocotylus was a\nseparate organism altogether.\n\n00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.637\nNow, the tapir is a mammal from South America.\n\n00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:55.585\nAnd the tapir has a prehensile penis.\n\n00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:58.627\nIt actually has a level of dexterity in its penis\n\n00:01:58.627 --> 00:02:01.053\nmuch akin to what we have with our hands.\n\n00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.725\nAnd it uses this dexterity\n\n00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:04.941\nto bypass the vagina altogether\n\n00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.312\nand deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,\n\n00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:11.866\nnot to mention it's a pretty good size.\n\n00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:13.795\nThe biggest penis in the animal kingdom,\n\n00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:15.490\nhowever, is not that of the tapir.\n\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.822\nThe biggest penis-to-body-size ratio\n\n00:02:17.822 --> 00:02:19.516\nin the animal kingdom actually belongs\n\n00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:21.767\nto the meager beach barnacle,\n\n00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.959\nand this video is actually showing you\n\n00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.043\nwhat the human penis would look like\n\n00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:29.504\nif it were the same size as that of a barnacle.\n\n00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:32.690\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.953\nMm-hm. (Laughter)\n\n00:02:34.953 --> 00:02:37.751\nSo with all of this diversity in structure,\n\n00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.908\none might think, then, that penises\n\n00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:42.879\nare fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place\n\n00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.956\nfor the purposes of successful reproduction.\n\n00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.501\nSimply insert part A into slot B,\n\n00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.576\nand we should all be good to go.\n\n00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:51.905\nBut of course, that doesn't exactly happen,\n\n00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.833\nand that's because we can't\njust take form into account.\n\n00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:57.115\nWe have to think about function as well,\n\n00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:58.905\nand when it comes to sex,\n\n00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:01.431\nfunction relates to the contributions made\n\n00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.230\nby the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.\n\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.564\nAnd these contributions are far from equal.\n\n00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:09.950\nEggs are very expensive to make,\n\n00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.901\nso it makes sense for females to be very choosy\n\n00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:15.338\nabout who she shares them with.\n\n00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:19.151\nSperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,\n\n00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:21.003\nso it makes more sense for males\n\n00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:23.153\nto have a more-sex-is-better strategy\n\n00:03:23.153 --> 00:03:24.565\nwhen it comes to siring members\n\n00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:26.411\nof future generations.\n\n00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.123\nSo how do animals cope\n\n00:03:28.123 --> 00:03:31.008\nwith these very incongruent\nneeds between the sexes?\n\n00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.257\nI mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,\n\n00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:36.696\nor if she has the ability to store sperm\n\n00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:38.373\nand she simply has enough,\n\n00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:40.446\nthen it makes more sense for her to spend her time\n\n00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:43.124\ndoing other biologically relevant things:\n\n00:03:43.124 --> 00:03:45.981\navoiding predators, taking care of offspring,\n\n00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:48.151\ngathering and ingesting food.\n\n00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:50.464\nThis is, of course, bad news for any male\n\n00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:53.015\nwho has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,\n\n00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:56.120\nand this sets the scene for\nsome pretty drastic strategies\n\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.426\nfor successful fertilization.\n\n00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:01.433\nThis is bedbug sex,\n\n00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:05.707\nand it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.\n\n00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:08.501\nMales have a spiked, barbed penis\n\n00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.105\nthat they literally stab into the female,\n\n00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.966\nand they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.\n\n00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:16.101\nThey stab it anywhere in her body,\n\n00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:17.898\nand the sperm simply migrates\n\n00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:21.202\nthrough her hemolymph to her ovaries.\n\n00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:23.346\nIf a female gets too many stab wounds,\n\n00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.692\nor if a stab wound happens to become infected,\n\n00:04:25.692 --> 00:04:28.071\nshe can actually die from it.\n\n00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:29.842\nNow if you've ever been out for a nice,\n\n00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:31.733\npeaceful walk by the lake\n\n00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:34.475\nand happened to see some ducks having sex,\n\n00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:36.170\nyou've undoubtedly been alarmed,\n\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.681\nbecause it looks like gang rape.\n\n00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:41.342\nAnd quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.\n\n00:04:41.342 --> 00:04:43.562\nA group of males will grab a female,\n\n00:04:43.562 --> 00:04:44.731\nhold her down,\n\n00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:49.161\nand ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis\n\n00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:52.245\ninto her corkscrew-shaped vagina\n\n00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:55.151\nover and over and over again.\n\n00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.940\nFrom flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.\n\n00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.075\nNow the female actually\ngets the last laugh, though,\n\n00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:03.902\nbecause she can actually manipulate her posture\n\n00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:07.007\nso as to allow the sperm of certain suitors\n\n00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:10.269\nbetter access to her ovaries.\n\n00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:12.379\nNow, I like to share stories\nlike this with my audiences\n\n00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.835\nbecause, yeah, we humans,\n\n00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:16.980\nwe tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,\n\n00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.221\nthere's romance, and there's orgasm.\n\n00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:20.903\nBut orgasm didn't actually evolve\n\n00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.989\nuntil about 65 million years ago\n\n00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.756\nwith the advent of mammals.\n\n00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:27.620\nBut some animals had it going\non quite a bit before that.\n\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.374\nThere are some more primitive ways\n\n00:05:29.374 --> 00:05:31.775\nof pleasing one's partner.\n\n00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:33.831\nEarwig males have either\n\n00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:35.589\nreally large penile appendages\n\n00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.990\nor really small ones.\n\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.811\nIt's a very simple genetically inherited trait\n\n00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:41.797\nand the males are not otherwise any different.\n\n00:05:41.797 --> 00:05:43.759\nThose that have long penile appendages\n\n00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.527\nare not bigger or stronger\n\n00:05:45.527 --> 00:05:47.031\nor otherwise any different at all.\n\n00:05:47.031 --> 00:05:49.572\nSo going back to our biological minds, then,\n\n00:05:49.572 --> 00:05:51.689\nwe might think that females should choose\n\n00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.670\nto have sex with the guys that\nhave the shorter appendages,\n\n00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.235\nbecause she can use her time for other things:\n\n00:05:57.235 --> 00:05:58.911\navoiding predators, taking care of young,\n\n00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.759\nfinding and ingesting food.\n\n00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.575\nBut biologists have repeatedly observed\n\n00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:05.543\nthat females choose to have sex\n\n00:06:05.543 --> 00:06:09.672\nwith the males that have the long appendages.\n\n00:06:09.672 --> 00:06:11.635\nWhy do they do this?\n\n00:06:11.635 --> 00:06:14.034\nWell, according to the biological literature,\n\n00:06:14.034 --> 00:06:16.861\n\"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males\n\n00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:19.481\nmay elicit more favorable female responses\n\n00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:22.558\nthrough superior mechanical\nor stimulatory interaction\n\n00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:26.116\nwith the female reproductive tract.\"\n\n00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:28.507\nMm-hm.\n\n00:06:28.507 --> 00:06:30.444\nThese are Mexican guppies,\n\n00:06:30.444 --> 00:06:32.575\nand what you see on their upper maxilla\n\n00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:34.977\nis an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,\n\n00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.822\nand these filaments basically form\n\n00:06:36.822 --> 00:06:39.420\na fish mustache, if you will.\n\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.762\nNow males have been observed to prod\n\n00:06:41.762 --> 00:06:43.426\nthe female's genital opening\n\n00:06:43.426 --> 00:06:45.373\nprior to copulating with her,\n\n00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:48.882\nand in what I have lovingly termed\nthe Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,\n\n00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:52.894\nfemales are overwhelmingly more likely to be found\n\n00:06:52.894 --> 00:06:56.859\nwith males that have these fish mustaches.\n\n00:06:56.859 --> 00:07:00.156\nA little guppy porn for you right there.\n\n00:07:00.156 --> 00:07:02.912\nSo we've seen very different strategies\n\n00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:05.150\nthat males are using when it comes to\n\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.746\nwinning a female partner.\n\n00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:11.734\nWe've seen a coercion strategy in which\nsexual structures are used in a forceful way\n\n00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:13.507\nto basically make a female have sex.\n\n00:07:13.507 --> 00:07:15.564\nWe've also seen a titillation strategy\n\n00:07:15.564 --> 00:07:17.501\nwhere males are actually\n\n00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:19.649\npleasing their female partners into choosing them\n\n00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.368\nas a sex partner.\n\n00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:23.813\nNow unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,\n\n00:07:23.813 --> 00:07:26.229\nit's the coercion strategy that we see\n\n00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:27.968\ntime and time again.\n\n00:07:27.968 --> 00:07:30.315\nIt's very common in many phyla,\n\n00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:32.948\nfrom invertebrates to avian species,\n\n00:07:32.948 --> 00:07:35.494\nmammals, and, of course, even in primates.\n\n00:07:35.494 --> 00:07:39.031\nNow interestingly, there \nare a few mammalian species\n\n00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:42.263\nin which females have evolved specialized genitalia\n\n00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:46.932\nthat doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.\n\n00:07:46.932 --> 00:07:49.300\nFemale elephants and female hyenas\n\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.674\nhave a penile clitoris,\n\n00:07:51.674 --> 00:07:55.481\nor an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,\n\n00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:57.040\nmuch like a penis,\n\n00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.424\nand in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals\n\n00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:02.591\nby merely looking at their external morphology.\n\n00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:06.183\nSo before a male can insert\nhis penis into a female's vagina,\n\n00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:08.038\nshe has to take this penile clitoris\n\n00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:11.601\nand basically inside-out it in her own body.\n\n00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:14.538\nI mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.\n\n00:08:14.538 --> 00:08:16.070\nIt's simply not going to happen\n\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.392\nunless the female is on board with the action.\n\n00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:21.205\nNow, even more interesting is the fact\n\n00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:23.214\nthat elephant and hyena societies\n\n00:08:23.214 --> 00:08:25.643\nare entirely matriarchal:\n\n00:08:25.643 --> 00:08:28.145\nthey're run by females, groups of females,\n\n00:08:28.145 --> 00:08:30.391\nsisters, aunts and offspring,\n\n00:08:30.391 --> 00:08:33.594\nand when young males attain sexual maturity,\n\n00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:35.471\nthey're turfed out of the group.\n\n00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.554\nIn hyena societies, adult males\n\n00:08:37.554 --> 00:08:40.816\nare actually the lowest on the social scale.\n\n00:08:40.816 --> 00:08:43.249\nThey can take part in a kill only after\n\n00:08:43.249 --> 00:08:45.979\neverybody else, including the offspring.\n\n00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:48.297\nSo it seems that when you take the penis power\n\n00:08:48.297 --> 00:08:50.135\naway from a male,\n\n00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:54.194\nyou take away all the social power he has.\n\n00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:56.836\nSo what are my take-home\nmessages from my talk today?\n\n00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:59.517\nWell, sex is just so much more\n\n00:08:59.517 --> 00:09:02.116\nthan insert part A into slot B\n\n00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:05.258\nand hope that the offspring run around everywhere.\n\n00:09:05.258 --> 00:09:07.915\nThe sexual strategies and reproductive structures\n\n00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:10.938\nthat we see in the animal kingdom basically\n\n00:09:10.938 --> 00:09:14.866\ndictate how males and females\nwill react to each other,\n\n00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:17.612\nwhich then dictates how populations and societies\n\n00:09:17.612 --> 00:09:19.227\nform and evolve.\n\n00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:21.711\nSo it may not be surprising to any of you\n\n00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:23.519\nthat animals, including ourselves,\n\n00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:27.129\nspend a good amount of time thinking about sex,\n\n00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:30.305\nbut what might surprise you is the extent to which\n\n00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:34.376\nso many other aspects of their lives and our lives\n\n00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:36.198\nare influenced by it.\n\n00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:38.161\nSo thank you, and happy daydreaming.\n\n00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:42.240\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The long reach of reason", "duration": "924", "url":

Cabbie: Twenty-two dollars. Steven Pinker: Okay. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein: Reason  appears to have fallen on hard times: Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth and political discourse has become a race to the bottom. We're living in an era of scientific creationism, 9/11 conspiracy theories, psychic hotlines, and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism. People who think too well are often accused of elitism, and even in the academy, there are attacks on logocentrism, the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking.SP: But is this necessarily a bad thing? Perhaps reason is overrated. Many pundits have argued that a good heart and steadfast moral clarity are superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks, like the best and brightest and that dragged us into the quagmire of Vietnam. And wasn't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction? In this way of thinking,  it's character and conscience, not cold-hearted calculation, that will save us. Besides, a human being is not a brain on a stick. My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact.RNG: How could a reasoned argument logically entail the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments? Look, you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence. You're not threatening us or bribing us, suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest. By the very act of trying to reason us into your position, you're conceding reason's potency. Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be. You show up for that debate and you've already lost it.SP: But can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral? After all, you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end, and the end depends on the reasoner's passions. Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony, but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife. Can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste?RNG: All on its own, the answer is no, but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes. You need two conditions: The first is that reasoners all care about their own well-being. That's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go to work, and it's obviously present in all of us. We all care passionately about our own well-being. The second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another's well-being, can exchange messages, and comprehend each other's reasoning. And that's certainly true of our gregarious and loquatious species, well endowed with the instinct for language.SP: Well, that sounds good in theory, but has it worked that way in practice? In particular, can it explain a momentous historical development that I spoke about five years ago here at TED? Namely, we seem to be getting more humane. Centuries ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive as a form of popular entertainment. Knights waged constant war on each other by trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible. Governments executed people for frivolous reasons, like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden. The executions were designed to be as prolonged and as painful as possible, like crucifixion, disembowelment, breaking on the wheel. Respectable people kept slaves. For all our flaws, we have abandoned these barbaric practices.RNG: So, do you think it's human nature that's changed?SP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts that can erupt in violence, like greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism. But we also have instincts that can steer us away, like self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness, what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.RNG: So if human nature didn't change, what invigorated those better angels?SP: Well, among other things, our circle of empathy expanded. Years ago, our ancestors would feel the pain only of their family and people in their village. But with the expansion of literacy and travel, people started to sympathize with wider and wider circles, the clan, the tribe, the nation, the race, and perhaps eventually, all of humanity.RNG: Can hard-headed scientists really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?SP: They can and do. Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain that respond to other people's actions the same way they respond to our own. Empathy emerges early in life, perhaps before the age of one. Books on empathy have become bestsellers, like \"The Empathic Civilization\" and \"The Age of Empathy.\"RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't? But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress. For one thing, it's innately biased toward blood relations, babies and warm, fuzzy animals. As far as empathy is concerned, ugly outsiders can go to hell. And even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by Adam Smith.Adam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire of China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake, and let us consider how a  man of humanity in Europe would react on receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people. He would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life, and when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed, he would pursue his business or his pleasure with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened. If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow, he would not sleep tonight, but provided he never saw them, he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.SP: But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane, what else was there?RNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels: reason. Reason has muscle. It's reason that provides the push to widen that circle of empathy. Every one of the humanitarian developments that you mentioned originated with thinkers who gave reasons for why some practice was indefensible. They demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves.SP: Are you saying that reason can actually change people's minds? Don't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in?RNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us: Contradictions bother us, at least when we're forced to confront them, which is just another way of saying that we are susceptible to reason. And if you look at the history of moral progress, you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel. Time and again, a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible, irrational, inconsistent with values already held. Their essay would go viral, get translated into many languages, get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons, and at dinner parties, and influence leaders, legislators, popular opinion. Eventually their conclusions get absorbed into the common sense of decency, erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there. Few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children. By now, these things just feel wrong. But just those arguments had to be made, and they were, in centuries past.SP: Are you saying that people needed a step-by-step argument to grasp why something might be a wee bit wrong with burning heretics at the stake?RNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian Sebastian Castellio making the case.Sebastian Castellio: Calvin says that he's certain, and other sects say that they are. Who shall be judge? If the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin? But then, why does he write so many books about manifest truth? In view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics simply as one with whom we disagree. And if then we are going to kill heretics, the logical outcome will be a war of extermination, since each is sure of himself.SP: Or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel?RNG: The prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764 by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.Cesare Beccaria: As punishments become more cruel, the minds of men, which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them, become hardened, and after a hundred years of cruel punishments, breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did. For a punishment to achieve its objective, it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime, and into this calculation ought to be factored the certainty of punishment and the loss of the good that the commission of the crime will produce. Everything beyond this is superfluous, and therefore tyrannical.SP: But surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war.RNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war, such as the father of modernity, Erasmus.Erasmus: The advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide, and reach great numbers, while in war, if anything turns out happily, the advantage redounds only to a few, and those unworthy of reaping it. One man's safety is owing to the destruction of another. One man's prize is derived from the plunder of another. The cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning. Whatever is unfortunate in war, is severely so indeed, and whatever, on the contrary, is called good fortune, is a savage and a cruel good fortune, an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe.SP: But everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion. It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers, and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" became a bestseller.RNG: But the ball got rolling a century before. John Locke bucked the tide of millennia that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural. He argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government.John Locke: Freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it, a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not, not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man, as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.SP: Those words sound familiar. Where have I read them before? Ah, yes.Mary Astell: If absolute sovereignty  be not necessary in a state, how comes it to be so in a family? Or if in a family, why not in a state? Since no reason can be alleged for the one that will not hold more strongly for the other, if all men are born free, how is it that all women are born slaves, as they must be if being subjected to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of men be the perfect condition of slavery?RNG: That sort of co-option is all in the job description of reason. One movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same, and once that's hammered home, it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement inspired the movements for women's rights, children's rights, gay rights and even animal rights. But fully two centuries before, the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham had exposed the indefensibility of customary practices such as the cruelty to animals.Jeremy Bentham: The question is not, can they reason, nor can they talk, but can they suffer?RNG: And the persecution of homosexuals.JB: As to any primary mischief, it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone. On the contrary, it produces pleasure. The partners are both willing. If either of them be unwilling, the act is an offense, totally different in its nature of effects. It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape. As to the any danger exclusive of pain, the danger, if any, much consist in the tendency of the example. But what is the tendency of this example? To dispose others to engage in the same practices. But this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone.SP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole. It kind of makes you wonder about our own time. Are there practices that we engage in where the arguments against them are there for all to see but nonetheless we persist in them?RNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us, will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning, wife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?SP: I'm sure everyone here could think of an example.RNG: I opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms.SP: The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons.RNG: Scrimping on donations to life-saving charities in the developing world.SP: The possession of nuclear weapons.RNG: The appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable, such as the ban on contraception.SP: What about religious faith in general?RNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.SP: Still, I have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future.RNG: And if, our friends, you detect a flaw in this argument, just remember you'll be depending on reason to point it out.Thank you.

Joe's 32 years old and a murderer. I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London. I'd like you to imagine this place. It looks and feels like it sounds: Wormwood Scrubs. Built at the end of the Victorian Era by the inmates themselves, it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept. These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil. And I was there to study their brains. I was part of a team of researchers from University College London, on a grant from the U.K. department of health. My task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths. That meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population. What lay at the root of their behavior? Was there a neurological cause for their condition? And if there was a neurological cause, could we find a cure?So I'd like to speak about change, and  especially about emotional change. Growing up, I was always intrigued by how people change. My mother, a clinical psychotherapist, would occasionally see patients at home in the evening. She would shut the door to the living room, and I imagined magical things happened in that room. At the age of five or six I would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door. On more than one occasion, I fell asleep and they had to push me out of the way at the end of the session.And I suppose that's how I found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs. Joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression. The prison warden, looking equally indifferent, said, \"Any trouble, just press the red buzzer, and we'll be around as soon as we can.\" (Laughter)I sat down. The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me. I looked up at the red buzzer far behind Joe on the opposite wall. (Laughter)I looked at Joe. Perhaps detecting my concern, he leaned forward, and said, as reassuringly as he could, \"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer, it doesn't work anyway.\" (Laughter)Over the subsequent months, we tested Joe and his fellow inmates, looking specifically at their ability to categorize different images of emotion. And we looked at their physical response to those emotions. So, for example, when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad, we instantly have a slight, measurable physical response: increased heart rate, sweating of the skin. Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately, they failed to show the emotions required. They failed to show a physical response. It was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy. So we wanted to look closer at this to use MRI to image their brains. That turned out to be not such an easy task. Imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central London in shackles and handcuffs in rush hour, and in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner, you have to remove all metal objects, including shackles and handcuffs, and, as I learned, all body piercings.After some time, however, we had a tentative answer. These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood. There was something else. People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain. It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy. Normally, the more empathic a person is, the larger and more active their amygdala is. Our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala, which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior.So let's take a step back. Normally, acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up, like learning to speak. At the age of six months, virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects. At the age of 12 months, most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others. So for example, your mother raises her hands to stretch, and you imitate her behavior. At first, this isn't perfect. I remember my cousin Sasha, two years old at the time, looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand, licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand. (Laughter) Bit by bit, we build the foundations  of the social brain so that by the time we're three, four years old, most children, not all, have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others, another prerequisite for empathy. The fact that this developmental progression is universal, irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit, strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn. If you doubt this, try, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made to a four-year-old. You will find that the mind of a four-year old is not na\u00efve in the slightest. It is more akin to a Swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness. The early years are crucial. There seems to be a window of opportunity, after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult, like adults learning a foreign language. That's not to say it's impossible. A recent, wonderful study from Stanford University showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards. Now I'm not suggesting we endow criminals with superpowers, but I am suggesting that we need to find ways to get Joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior, for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us.So can brains change? For over 100 years, neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood, no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain. The brain could only change within certain set limits. That was the dogma. But then, in the 1990s, studies starting showing, following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others, studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis, the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian brain, first in the olfactory bulb, which is responsible for our sense of smell, then in the hippocampus involving short-term memory, and finally in the amygdala itself. In order to understand how this process works, I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford specializing in learning and development. Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice, because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals. So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage, a shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool, alone and without much stimulation, not only does it not thrive, but it will often develop strange, repetitive behaviors. This naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice, even becoming aggressive when introduced to them. However, mice reared in what we called an enriched environment, a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore, demonstrate neurogenesis, the birth of new brain cells, and as we showed, they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks. Now, they don't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street, but their improved environment results in healthy, sociable behavior. Mice reared in a standard cage, by contrast, not dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell, have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain.It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals, including primates like us, can show neurogenesis. In some areas of the brain, more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed. We're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have, but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood. However, our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment. Stress hormones, glucocorticoids, released by the brain, suppress the growth of these new cells. The more stress, the less brain development, which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels. This is the interplay between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes. When you think about it, it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth. Of course, imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society. Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala. The evidence is actually the other way. Because our brains are capable of change, we need to take responsibility for our actions, and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation. One way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs. Here victims, if they choose to participate, and perpetrators meet face to face in safe, structured encounters, and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, and the victim plays an active role in the process. In such a setting, the perpetrator can see, perhaps for the first time, the victim as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response. This stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration. Such programs won't work for everyone, but for many, it could be a way to break the frozen sea within.So what can we do now? How can we apply this knowledge? I'd like to leave you with three lessons that I learned. The first thing that I learned was that we need to change our mindset. Since Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago, society has advanced in virtually every aspect, in the way we run our schools, our hospitals. Yet the moment we speak about prisons, it's as though we're back in Dickensian times, if not medieval times. For too long, I believe, we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human  nature cannot change, and as a society, it's costing us dearly. We know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change, and the best way to achieve that, even in adults, is to change and modulate our environment.The second thing I have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral to bringing about social change. It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place a high-security inmate in an MRI scanner. Well actually, that turns out not to be so easy, but ultimately what we want to show is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates. In order to answer complex questions like that, we need people of different backgrounds \u2014 lab-based scientists and clinicians, social workers and policy makers, philanthropists and human rights activists \u2014 to work together.Finally, I believe we need to change our own amygdalae, because this issue goes to the heart not just of who Joe is, but who we are. We need to change our view of Joe as someone wholly irredeemable, because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable, how is he going to see himself as any different? In another decade, Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs. Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system? Wouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence, Joe was able to train his amygdala, which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections, so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released? Surely, that would be in the interest of all of us.(Applause) Thank you.

00:00:33.929\nI'd like you to imagine this place.\n\n00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.027\nIt looks and feels like it sounds:\n\n00:00:37.027 --> 00:00:39.409\nWormwood Scrubs.\n\n00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.633\nBuilt at the end of the Victorian Era\n\n00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:43.145\nby the inmates themselves,\n\n00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:46.345\nit is where England's most\ndangerous prisoners are

brains.\n\n00:00:54.432 --> 00:00:56.184\nI was part of a team of researchers\n\n00:00:56.184 --> 00:00:57.861\nfrom University College London,\n\n00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:00.616\non a grant from the U.K. department of health.\n\n00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:02.664\nMy task was to study a group of inmates\n\n00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:05.408\nwho had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.\n\n00:01:05.408 --> 00:01:07.133\nThat meant they were the most\n\n00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.846\ncallous and the most aggressive\n\n00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:11.970\nof the entire prison population.\n\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.547\nWhat lay at the root of their behavior?\n\n00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:19.873\nWas there a neurological cause for their condition?\n\n00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:22.716\nAnd if there was a neurological cause,\n\n00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.771\ncould we find a cure?\n\n00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.716\nSo I'd like to speak about change, and \nespecially about emotional change.\n\n00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:31.696\nGrowing up, I was always intrigued\n\n00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:34.760\nby how people change.\n\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.283\nMy mother, a clinical psychotherapist,\n\n00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.923\nwould occasionally see patients at home\n\n00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:41.343\nin the evening.\n\n00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:42.877\nShe would shut the door to the living room,\n\n00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:44.882\nand I imagined\n\n00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:47.394\nmagical things happened in that room.\n\n00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:49.075\nAt the age of five or six\n\n00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.517\nI would creep up in my pajamas\n\n00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:54.326\nand sit outside with my ear glued to the door.\n\n00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:55.773\nOn more than one occasion, I fell asleep\n\n00:01:55.773 --> 00:01:57.233\nand they had to push me out of the way\n\n00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:59.394\nat the end of the session.\n\n00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:02.293\nAnd I suppose that's how I found myself\n\n00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:04.368\nwalking into the secure interview room\n\n00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:08.377\non my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.\n\n00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:10.713\nJoe sat across a steel table\n\n00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:14.939\nand greeted me with this blank expression.\n\n00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.817\nThe prison warden, looking equally indifferent,\n\n00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:20.464\nsaid, \"Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,\n\n00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:22.903\nand we'll be around as soon as we can.\"\n\n00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:25.861\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.631\nI sat down.\n\n00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.608\nThe heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.\n\n00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.702\nI looked up at the red buzzer\n\n00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:34.801\nfar behind Joe on the opposite wall.\n\n00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:37.447\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:39.209\nI looked at Joe.\n\n00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.286\nPerhaps detecting my concern,\n\n00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.642\nhe leaned forward, and said,\n\n00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:44.869\nas reassuringly as he could,\n\n00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.249\n\"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,\n\n00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.502\nit doesn't work anyway.\"\n\n00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:53.949\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.319\nOver the subsequent months,\n\n00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.404\nwe tested Joe and his fellow inmates,\n\n00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.455\nlooking specifically at their ability\n\n00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:08.439\nto categorize different images of emotion.\n\n00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.225\nAnd we looked at their physical response\n\n00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:11.967\nto those emotions.\n\n00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:13.548\nSo, for example, when most of us look\n\n00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:16.473\nat a picture like this of somebody looking sad,\n\n00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:20.024\nwe instantly have a slight,\n\n00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:21.958\nmeasurable physical response:\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.256\nincreased heart rate, sweating of the skin.\n\n00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:27.040\nWhilst the psychopaths in our study were able\n\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.054\nto describe the pictures accurately,\n\n00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:32.787\nthey failed to show the emotions required.\n\n00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:36.340\nThey failed to show a physical response.\n\n00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.391\nIt was as though they knew the words\n\n00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:41.784\nbut not the music of empathy.\n\n00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:43.568\nSo we wanted to look closer at this\n\n00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:47.017\nto use MRI to image their brains.\n\n00:03:47.017 --> 00:03:50.124\nThat turned out to be not such an easy task.\n\n00:03:50.124 --> 00:03:51.953\nImagine transporting a collection\n\n00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:54.648\nof clinical psychopaths across central London\n\n00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:56.787\nin shackles and handcuffs\n\n00:03:56.787 --> 00:03:58.913\nin rush hour,\n\n00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:02.087\nand in order to place each\nof them in an MRI scanner,\n\n00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:04.068\nyou have to remove all metal objects,\n\n00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:05.402\nincluding shackles and handcuffs,\n\n00:04:05.402 --> 00:04:09.757\nand, as I learned, all body piercings.\n\n00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:13.994\nAfter some time, however,\nwe had a tentative answer.\n\n00:04:13.994 --> 00:04:16.812\nThese individuals were not just the victims\n\n00:04:16.812 --> 00:04:18.864\nof a troubled childhood.\n\n00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:21.385\nThere was something else.\n\n00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:25.005\nPeople like Joe have a deficit in a brain area\n\n00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.066\ncalled the amygdala.\n\n00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.090\nThe amygdala is an almond-shaped organ\n\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.413\ndeep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.\n\n00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:36.898\nIt is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.\n\n00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:39.804\nNormally, the more empathic a person is,\n\n00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:42.849\nthe larger and more active their amygdala is.\n\n00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.329\nOur population of inmates\n\n00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:45.656\nhad a deficient amygdala,\n\n00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:47.951\nwhich likely led to their lack of empathy\n\n00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.885\nand to their immoral behavior.\n\n00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:54.027\nSo let's take a step back.\n\n00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.650\nNormally, acquiring moral behavior\n\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.040\nis simply part of growing up,\n\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.241\nlike learning to speak.\n\n00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:04.532\nAt the age of six months, virtually every one of us\n\n00:05:04.532 --> 00:05:08.489\nis able to differentiate between\nanimate and inanimate objects.\n\n00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:10.963\nAt the age of 12 months,\n\n00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:14.187\nmost children are able to imitate\n\n00:05:14.187 --> 00:05:16.072\nthe purposeful actions of others.\n\n00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:18.607\nSo for example, your mother raises her hands\n\n00:05:18.607 --> 00:05:21.346\nto stretch, and you imitate her behavior.\n\n00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:24.547\nAt first, this isn't perfect.\n\n00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.494\nI remember my cousin Sasha,\n\n00:05:26.494 --> 00:05:28.657\ntwo years old at the time,\n\n00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:30.317\nlooking through a picture book\n\n00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:33.500\nand licking one finger and flicking\nthe page with the other hand,\n\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.605\nlicking one finger and flicking\nthe page with the other hand.\n\n00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:37.919\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.845\nBit by bit, we build the foundations \nof the social brain\n\n00:05:41.845 --> 00:05:46.477\nso that by the time we're three, four years old,\n\n00:05:46.477 --> 00:05:47.769\nmost children, not all,\n\n00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:49.542\nhave acquired the ability to understand\n\n00:05:49.542 --> 00:05:51.145\nthe intentions of others,\n\n00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:54.471\nanother prerequisite for empathy.\n\n00:05:54.471 --> 00:05:57.083\nThe fact that this developmental progression\n\n00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.585\nis universal,\n\n00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.561\nirrespective of where you live in the world\n\n00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.187\nor which culture you inhabit,\n\n00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:05.400\nstrongly suggests that the foundations\n\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.524\nof moral behavior are inborn.\n\n00:06:08.524 --> 00:06:11.001\nIf you doubt this,\n\n00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:14.777\ntry, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made\n\n00:06:14.777 --> 00:06:16.854\nto a four-year-old.\n\n00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:18.642\nYou will find that the mind of a four-year old\n\n00:06:18.642 --> 00:06:20.146\nis not na\u00efve in the slightest.\n\n00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:23.171\nIt is more akin to a Swiss army knife\n\n00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:25.202\nwith fixed mental modules\n\n00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:27.676\nfinely honed during development\n\n00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:30.793\nand a sharp sense of fairness.\n\n00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:33.451\nThe early years are crucial.\n\n00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:35.695\nThere seems to be a window of opportunity,\n\n00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.161\nafter which mastering moral questions\n\n00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:39.643\nbecomes more difficult,\n\n00:06:39.643 --> 00:06:43.777\nlike adults learning a foreign language.\n\n00:06:43.777 --> 00:06:45.811\nThat's not to say it's impossible.\n\n00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.920\nA recent, wonderful study from Stanford University\n\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.161\nshowed that people who have played\n\n00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.570\na virtual reality game in which they took on\n\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.031\nthe role of a good and helpful superhero\n\n00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.147\nactually became more caring and helpful\n\n00:06:58.147 --> 00:07:00.650\ntowards others afterwards.\n\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.859\nNow I'm not suggesting\n\n00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:05.914\nwe endow criminals with superpowers,\n\n00:07:05.914 --> 00:07:09.327\nbut I am suggesting that we need to find ways\n\n00:07:09.327 --> 00:07:11.205\nto get Joe and people like him\n\n00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:13.850\nto change their brains and their behavior,\n\n00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.625\nfor their benefit\n\n00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:18.760\nand for the benefit of the rest of us.\n\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.295\nSo can brains change?\n\n00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:24.879\nFor over 100 years,\n\n00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.993\nneuroanatomists and later neuroscientists\n\n00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:31.813\nheld the view that after initial\ndevelopment in childhood,\n\n00:07:31.813 --> 00:07:34.237\nno new brain cells could grow\n\n00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:35.538\nin the adult human brain.\n\n00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.025\nThe brain could only change\n\n00:07:37.025 --> 00:07:39.007\nwithin certain set limits.\n\n00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:41.105\nThat was the dogma.\n\n00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:43.344\nBut then, in the 1990s,\n\n00:07:43.344 --> 00:07:45.040\nstudies starting showing,\n\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.777\nfollowing the lead of Elizabeth\nGould at Princeton and others,\n\n00:07:47.777 --> 00:07:51.112\nstudies started showing the\nevidence of neurogenesis,\n\n00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:53.170\nthe birth of new brain cells\n\n00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.239\nin the adult mammalian brain,\n\n00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:57.823\nfirst in the olfactory bulb,\n\n00:07:57.823 --> 00:07:59.904\nwhich is responsible for our sense of smell,\n\n00:07:59.904 --> 00:08:01.943\nthen in the hippocampus\n\n00:08:01.943 --> 00:08:03.987\ninvolving short-term memory,\n\n00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:07.270\nand finally in the amygdala itself.\n\n00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.046\nIn order to understand\n\n00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:11.005\nhow this process works,\n\n00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:13.894\nI left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford\n\n00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:17.156\nspecializing in learning and development.\n\n00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:20.926\nInstead of psychopaths, I studied mice,\n\n00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:23.267\nbecause the same pattern of brain responses\n\n00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:26.997\nappears across many different\nspecies of social animals.\n\n00:08:26.997 --> 00:08:31.579\nSo if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,\n\n00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:34.267\na shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,\n\n00:08:34.267 --> 00:08:35.834\nalone and without much stimulation,\n\n00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.445\nnot only does it not thrive,\n\n00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:39.202\nbut it will often develop strange,\n\n00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:40.776\nrepetitive behaviors.\n\n00:08:40.776 --> 00:08:43.395\nThis naturally sociable animal\n\n00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:45.838\nwill lose its ability to bond with other mice,\n\n00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:50.033\neven becoming aggressive when introduced to them.\n\n00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:52.095\nHowever, mice reared in what we called\n\n00:08:52.095 --> 00:08:53.601\nan enriched environment,\n\n00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.812\na large habitation with other mice\n\n00:08:55.812 --> 00:08:59.242\nwith wheels and ladders and areas to explore,\n\n00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:00.827\ndemonstrate neurogenesis,\n\n00:09:00.827 --> 00:09:03.127\nthe birth of new brain cells,\n\n00:09:03.127 --> 00:09:05.441\nand as we showed, they also perform better\n\n00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:08.158\non a range of learning and memory tasks.\n\n00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:10.588\nNow, they don't develop morality to the point of\n\n00:09:10.588 --> 00:09:12.348\ncarrying the shopping bags of little old mice\n\n00:09:12.348 --> 00:09:14.569\nacross the street,\n\n00:09:14.569 --> 00:09:17.312\nbut their improved environment results in healthy,\n\n00:09:17.312 --> 00:09:19.225\nsociable behavior.\n\n00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.168\nMice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,\n\n00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:24.633\nnot dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,\n\n00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:27.934\nhave dramatically lower levels of new neurons\n\n00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.561\nin the brain.\n\n00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:32.377\nIt is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,\n\n00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:33.883\nincluding primates like us,\n\n00:09:33.883 --> 00:09:36.395\ncan show neurogenesis.\n\n00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:37.681\nIn some areas of the brain,\n\n00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.376\nmore than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.\n\n00:09:41.376 --> 00:09:43.635\nWe're just beginning to understand\n\n00:09:43.635 --> 00:09:45.729\nwhat exact function these cells have,\n\n00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:48.655\nbut what it implies is that the brain is capable\n\n00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:53.848\nof extraordinary change way into adulthood.\n\n00:09:53.848 --> 00:09:55.582\nHowever, our brains are also\n\n00:09:55.582 --> 00:09:59.222\nexquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.\n\n00:09:59.222 --> 00:10:01.772\nStress hormones, glucocorticoids,\n\n00:10:01.772 --> 00:10:03.322\nreleased by the brain,\n\n00:10:03.322 --> 00:10:06.883\nsuppress the growth of these new cells.\n\n00:10:06.883 --> 00:10:09.431\nThe more stress, the less brain development,\n\n00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:13.899\nwhich in turn causes less adaptability\n\n00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:16.642\nand causes higher stress levels.\n\n00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:20.427\nThis is the interplay between nature and nurture\n\n00:10:20.427 --> 00:10:24.132\nin real time in front of our eyes.\n\n00:10:24.132 --> 00:10:26.199\nWhen you think about it,\n\n00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:28.574\nit is ironic that our current solution\n\n00:10:28.574 --> 00:10:30.500\nfor people with stressed amygdalae\n\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.292\nis to place them in an environment\n\n00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:36.621\nthat actually inhibits any chance of further growth.\n\n00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:39.108\nOf course, imprisonment is a necessary part\n\n00:10:39.108 --> 00:10:41.528\nof the criminal justice system\n\n00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:43.293\nand of protecting society.\n\n00:10:43.293 --> 00:10:44.930\nOur research does not suggest\n\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.147\nthat criminals should submit their MRI scans\n\n00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.569\nas evidence in court\n\n00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:52.227\nand get off the hook because\nthey've got a faulty amygdala.\n\n00:10:52.227 --> 00:10:54.300\nThe evidence is actually the other way.\n\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.151\nBecause our brains are capable of change,\n\n00:10:57.151 --> 00:10:59.649\nwe need to take responsibility for our actions,\n\n00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:01.501\nand they need to take responsibility\n\n00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.929\nfor their rehabilitation.\n\n00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:06.733\nOne way such rehabilitation might work\n\n00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:10.026\nis through restorative justice programs.\n\n00:11:10.026 --> 00:11:12.355\nHere victims, if they choose to participate,\n\n00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:14.596\nand perpetrators meet face to face\n\n00:11:14.596 --> 00:11:17.296\nin safe, structured encounters,\n\n00:11:17.296 --> 00:11:19.126\nand the perpetrator is encouraged\n\n00:11:19.126 --> 00:11:21.095\nto take responsibility for their actions,\n\n00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:24.324\nand the victim plays an active role in the process.\n\n00:11:24.324 --> 00:11:27.195\nIn such a setting, the perpetrator can see,\n\n00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:29.530\nperhaps for the first time,\n\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.934\nthe victim as a real person\n\n00:11:31.934 --> 00:11:33.603\nwith thoughts and feelings and a genuine\n\n00:11:33.603 --> 00:11:35.441\nemotional response.\n\n00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:37.332\nThis stimulates the amygdala\n\n00:11:37.332 --> 00:11:40.883\nand may be a more effective rehabilitative practice\n\n00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:43.949\nthan simple incarceration.\n\n00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:45.534\nSuch programs won't work for everyone,\n\n00:11:45.534 --> 00:11:48.223\nbut for many, it could be a way\n\n00:11:48.223 --> 00:11:52.584\nto break the frozen sea within.\n\n00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:55.343\nSo what can we do now?\n\n00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:57.855\nHow can we apply this knowledge?\n\n00:11:57.855 --> 00:12:00.176\nI'd like to leave you with\n\n00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:01.921\nthree lessons that I learned.\n\n00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.091\nThe first thing that I learned was that\n\n00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:05.617\nwe need to change our mindset.\n\n00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:08.766\nSince Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,\n\n00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:11.881\nsociety has advanced in virtually every aspect,\n\n00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:15.295\nin the way we run our schools, our hospitals.\n\n00:12:15.295 --> 00:12:17.378\nYet the moment we speak about prisons,\n\n00:12:17.378 --> 00:12:20.274\nit's as though we're back in Dickensian times,\n\n00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:22.498\nif not medieval times.\n\n00:12:22.498 --> 00:12:24.732\nFor too long, I believe,\n\n00:12:24.732 --> 00:12:28.397\nwe've allowed ourselves to be persuaded\n\n00:12:28.397 --> 00:12:31.439\nof the false notion that human \nnature cannot change,\n\n00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:35.102\nand as a society, it's costing us dearly.\n\n00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:38.978\nWe know that the brain is\ncapable of extraordinary change,\n\n00:12:38.978 --> 00:12:42.017\nand the best way to achieve that,\n\n00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:44.429\neven in adults, is to change and modulate\n\n00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:46.224\nour environment.\n\n00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:49.109\nThe second thing I have learned\n\n00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:51.735\nis that we need to create an alliance\n\n00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:55.236\nof people who believe that science is integral\n\n00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:57.518\nto bringing about social change.\n\n00:12:57.518 --> 00:13:00.491\nIt's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place\n\n00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:02.670\na high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.\n\n00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.178\nWell actually, that turns out not to be so easy,\n\n00:13:05.178 --> 00:13:07.837\nbut ultimately what we want to show\n\n00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:11.605\nis whether we're able to\nreduce the reoffending rates.\n\n00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:14.326\nIn order to answer complex questions like that,\n\n00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.977\nwe need people of different backgrounds --\n\n00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:19.181\nlab-based scientists and clinicians,\n\n00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:21.571\nsocial workers and policy makers,\n\n00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:24.194\nphilanthropists and human rights activists \u2014\n\n00:13:24.194 --> 00:13:26.120\nto work together.\n\n00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.807\nFinally, I believe we need\n\n00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.445\nto change our own amygdalae,\n\n00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:32.226\nbecause this issue goes to the heart\n\n00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:33.997\nnot just of who Joe is,\n\n00:13:33.997 --> 00:13:35.909\nbut who we are.\n\n00:13:35.909 --> 00:13:38.889\nWe need to change our view of Joe\n\n00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:42.691\nas someone wholly irredeemable,\n\n00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:46.201\nbecause if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,\n\n00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:50.481\nhow is he going to see himself as any different?\n\n00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:52.352\nIn another decade, Joe will be released\n\n00:13:52.352 --> 00:13:55.021\nfrom Wormwood Scrubs.\n\n00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:57.938\nWill he be among the 70 percent of inmates\n\n00:13:57.938 --> 00:13:59.432\nwho end up reoffending\n\n00:13:59.432 --> 00:14:02.214\nand returning to the prison system?\n\n00:14:02.214 --> 00:14:04.850\nWouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,\n\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.776\nJoe was able to train his amygdala,\n\n00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:09.130\nwhich would stimulate the growth of new brain cells\n\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.411\nand connections,\n\n00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:13.007\nso that he will be able to face the world\n\n00:14:13.007 --> 00:14:15.127\nonce he gets released?\n\n00:14:15.127 --> 00:14:19.591\nSurely, that would be in the interest of all of us.\n\n00:14:21.507 --> 00:14:24.758\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:24.758 --> 00:14:28.760\nThank you. (Applause)"}, {"title": "Here's how we take back the Internet", "duration": "2102", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/edward_snowden_here_s_how_we_take_back_the_internet", "transcript": "Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens, the future of the Internet. So I would like to welcome to the TED stage the man behind those revelations, Ed Snowden. (Applause) Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia controlling this bot from his laptop, so he can see what the bot can see. Ed, welcome to the TED stage. What can you see, as a matter of fact?Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone. This is amazing. (Laughter)CA: Ed, some questions for you. You've been called many things in the last few months. You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor, a hero. What words would you describe yourself with?ES: You know, everybody who is involved with this debate has been struggling over me and my personality and how to describe me. But when I think about it, this isn't the question that we should be struggling with. Who I am really doesn't matter at all. If I'm the worst person in the world, you can hate me and move on. What really matters here are the issues. What really matters here is the kind of government we want, the kind of Internet we want, the kind of relationship between people and societies. And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards, and we've seen that increasing over time. If I had to describe myself, I wouldn't use words like \"hero.\" I wouldn't use \"patriot,\" and I wouldn't use \"traitor.\" I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen, just like everyone else.CA: So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA. As a sysadmin, you had access to their systems, and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June's revelations. Now, what propelled you to do this? ES: You know, when I was sitting in Hawaii, and the years before, when I was working in the intelligence community, I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me. We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community, things that need to be done, and things that help everyone. But there are also things that go too far. There are things that shouldn't be done, and decisions that were being made in secret without the public's awareness, without the public's consent, and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs. When I really came to struggle with these issues, I thought to myself, how can I do this in the most responsible way, that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks? And out of all the solutions that I could come up with, out of going to Congress, when there were no laws, there were no legal protections for a private employee, a contractor in intelligence like myself, there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out. But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason, and that's to enable an adversarial press, to challenge the government, but also to work together with the government, to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance without putting our national security at risk. And by working with journalists, by giving all of my information back to the American people, rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication, we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone. And the risks that have been threatened, the risks that have been played up by the government have never materialized. We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm, and because of that, I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.CA: So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed. If we could have a slide up, and Ed, I don't know whether you can see, the slides are here. This is a slide of the PRISM program, and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed.ES: The best way to understand PRISM, because there's been a little bit of controversy, is to first talk about what PRISM isn't. Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata. They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata, and they're talking about a specific legal authority called Section 215 of the Patriot Act. That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping, mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records, things like that \u2014 who you're talking to, when you're talking to them, where you traveled. These are all metadata events. PRISM is about content. It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America, it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA. And even though some of these companies did resist, even though some of them \u2014 I believe Yahoo was one of them \u2014 challenged them in court, they all lost, because it was never tried by an open court. They were only tried by a secret court. And something that we've seen, something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is, there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said 15 federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful, but what they don't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that's considered 34,000 warrant requests over 33 years, and in 33 years only rejected 11 government requests. These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be.CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies, Internet companies, are alleged to have joined the program, and where data collection began from them. Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA. How was that data collected by the NSA?ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access. What that means to an actual NSA analyst, someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers, things like that, in Hawaii, is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers. It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around and making back-room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away. Now each company handles it different ways. Some are responsible. Some are somewhat less responsible. But the bottom line is, when we talk about how this information is given, it's coming from the companies themselves. It's not stolen from the lines. But there's an important thing to remember here: even though companies pushed back, even though companies demanded, hey, let's do this through a warrant process, let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review, some sort of basis for handing over these users' data, we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself. So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA, the NSA isn't satisfied with that, and because of that, we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user, and also advocate for the rights of the users. And I think over the last year, we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that, and I encourage them to continue.CA: What more should they do?ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today, right now, without consulting with lawyers, to protect the rights of users worldwide, is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit. The reason this matters is today, if you go to look at a copy of \"1984\" on Amazon.com, the NSA can see a record of that, the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that, the Chinese service can see a record of that, the French service, the German service, the services of Andorra. They can all see it because it's unencrypted. The world's library is Amazon.com, but not only do they not support encryption by default, you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books. This is something that we need to change, not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out, but they're a great example. All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own. That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide.CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage. I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause) This is a program called Boundless Informant. What is that?ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this. This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms. Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress. The NSA was previously asked by Congress, was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted. They said no. They said, we don't track those stats, and we can't track those stats. We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world, because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy. Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them, but the reality, when you look at this slide is, not only do they have the capability, the capability already exists. It's already in place. The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication, and if it says, this communication came from America, they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today, right now. And what Boundless Informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians. I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for.CA: Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post, again from your data. The headline says, \"NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year.\" Tell us about that.ES: We also heard in Congressional testimony last year, it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA and who's seen the actual internal documents, knows what's in them, to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses, that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules, when we knew this story was coming. But what's especially interesting about this, about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules, their own laws thousands of times in a single year, including one event by itself, one event out of those 2,776, that affected more than 3,000 people. In another event, they intercepted all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident. What's amazing about this, this report, that didn't get that much attention, is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report. And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it, but had never seen this before that. What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year?CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this: Why should we care about all this surveillance, honestly? I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to worry about. What's wrong with that point of view? ES: Well, so the first thing is, you're giving up your rights. You're saying hey, you know, I don't think I'm going to need them, so I'm just going to trust that, you know, let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter, these guys are going to do the right thing. Your rights matter because you never know when you're going to need them. Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity, not just in America, but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world. People should be able to pick up the phone and to call their family, people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones, people should be able to buy a book online, they should be able to travel by train, they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look to an agent of the government, possibly not even your government years in the future, how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were. We have a right to privacy. We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody, any government authority, with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.CA: Some people are furious at what you've done. I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite, Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog. He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history. What would you say to people who think that?ES: Dick Cheney's really something else. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. (Laughter) I think it's amazing, because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work, Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide, the skies were going to ignite and the seas were going to boil off, and now he's saying it's a flea bite. So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security from these kind of officials. But let's assume that these people really believe this. I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security. The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe. The public interest is not always the same as the national interest. Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe, and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet. The Internet is not the enemy. Our economy is not the enemy. American businesses, Chinese businesses, and any other company out there is a part of our society. It's a part of our interconnected world. There are ties of fraternity that bond us together, and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards, the security, the manner of behavior, that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by.CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen 1.7 million documents. It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far. Are there more revelations to come?ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come. I don't think there's any question that some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come.CA: Come here, because I want to ask you about this particular revelation. Come and take a look at this. I mean, this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months. It's about a program called \"Bullrun.\" Can you explain what that is?ES: So Bullrun, and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor, this is a program named after a Civil War battle. The British counterpart is called Edgehill, which is a U.K. civil war battle. And the reason that I believe they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure. They're programs through which the NSA intentionally misleads corporate partners. They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards. They say hey, we need to work with you to secure your systems, but in reality, they're giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services. They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit, but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications. And this is really dangerous, because if we lose a single standard, if we lose the trust of something like SSL, which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program, we will live a less safe world overall. We won't be able to access our banks and we won't be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends.CA: And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources?ES: Absolutely. One of the problems, one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post-9/11 era, is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats. They've been in charge of offensive operations, that is hacking, but they've also been in charge of defensive operations, and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more. If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets, if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets, that has less value to the American people than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets. So by reducing the security of our communications, they're not only putting the world at risk, they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way, because intellectual property is the basis, the foundation of our economy, and if we put that at risk through weak security, we're going to be paying for it for years.CA: But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this as part of America's defense against terrorism. Surely that makes it a price worth paying.ES: Well, when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism, you will see that that's unfounded, and you don't have to take my word for it, because we've had the first open court, the first federal court that's reviewed this, outside the secrecy arrangement, called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional. Congress, who has access to be briefed on these things, and now has the desire to be, has produced bills to reform it, and two independent White House panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the United States. So is it really terrorism that we're stopping? Do these programs have any value at all? I say no, and all three branches of the American government say no as well.CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism?ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism?ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call a cover for action. Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise. The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs, the NSA asked for these authorities back in the 1990s. They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case. The FBI went to Congress and did make the case. But Congress and the American people said no. They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy. They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains. But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era, they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism to start these programs in secret without asking Congress, without asking the American people, and it's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need to guard ourselves against, because it makes us less safe, and it offers no value.CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec, because I've got a more personal question for you. Speaking of terror, most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying. You obviously heard what happened, what the treatment that Bradley Manning got, Chelsea Manning as now is, and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead. How are you coping with this? How are you coping with the fear?ES: It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead. I've made clear again and again and again that I go to sleep every morning thinking about what I can do for the American people. I don't want to harm my government. I want to help my government, but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process, they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial, these are things that we need to work against as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate. We shouldn't be threatening dissidents. We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism. And whatever part I can do to see that end, I'm happy to do despite the risks.CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here, because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden. Suppose you had the following two choices, right? You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered America or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America and the world's long-term good? Those are the two choices I'll give you. I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those, that this was a reckless act? There are some hands going up. Some hands going up. It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here, but I see them.ES: I can see you. (Laughter)CA: And who goes with the second choice, the fundamentally heroic act?(Applause) (Cheers)And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand and I think are still thinking this through, because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines. It's not left or right, it's not really about pro-government, libertarian, or not just that. Part of it is almost a generational issue. You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet. Is there some truth to that?ES: It is. I think it's very true. This is not a left or right issue. Our basic freedoms, and when I say our, I don't just mean Americans, I mean people around the world, it's not a partisan issue. These are things that all people believe, and it's up to all of us to protect them, and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet, it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy, and if we don't change things, if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do to keep the Internet safe, not just for us but for everyone, we're going to lose that, and that would be a tremendous loss, not just for us, but for the world.CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web, who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say, do we have a microphone for Tim?(Applause)Tim, good to see you. Come up there. Which camp are you in, by the way, traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but \u2014Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer answers to that question, but hero, if I have to make the choice between the two.CA: And Ed, I think you've read the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet. Is that something that makes sense? ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up not just thinking about the Internet, but I grew up in the Internet, and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it in this unusual, almost avatar manner, I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet has actually become close to the Internet as a result of their political expression. And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need. We need to encode our values not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet, and it's something that I hope, I invite everyone in the audience, not just here in Vancouver but around the world, to join and participate in.CA: Do you have a question for Ed?TBL: Well, two questions, a general question \u2014CA: Ed, can you still hear us?ES: Yes, I can hear you. CA: Oh, he's back.TBL: The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment. (Laughter)ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.TBL: So, from the 25 years, stepping back and thinking, what would you think would be the best that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want?ES: When we think about in terms of how far we can go, I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it. I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need, and by cooperating, by engaging not just the technical parts of society, but as you said, the users, the people around the world who contribute through the Internet, through social media, who just check the weather, who rely on it every day as a part of their life, to champion that. We'll get not just the Internet we've had, but a better Internet, a better now, something that we can use to build a future that'll be better not just than what we hoped for but anything that we could have imagined.CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984. A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong. It's not Big Brother watching us. We, through the power of the web, and transparency, are now watching Big Brother. Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view, but you still believe there's a way of doing something about that. And you do too.ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously. There was a recent legal article at Yale that established something called the Bankston-Soltani Principle, which is that our expectation of privacy is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude, and each time that occurs, we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights. Now, that hasn't happened since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude, and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today, but there is still hope, because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology. I am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win, and I think that's something that we need to take hope from, and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world. Journalism is not a crime, communication is not a crime, and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities.CA: I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot, but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here. TBL: That'll come very soon. ES: Nice to meet you, and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does.CA: Thank you, Tim.(Applause)I mean, The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you. Would you welcome the chance to come back to America?ES: Absolutely. There's really no question, the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world, and I think if the press is now saying, we support this, this is something that needed to happen, that's a powerful argument, but it's not the final argument, and I think that's something that public should decide. But at the same time, the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal, that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working, to come back, and I want to make it very clear that I did not do this to be safe. I did this to do what was right, and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself. (Applause)CA: In the meantime, courtesy of the Internet and this technology, you're here, back in North America, not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form. I'm curious, how does that feel?ES: Canada is different than what I expected. It's a lot warmer. (Laughter)CA: At TED, the mission is \"ideas worth spreading.\" If you could encapsulate it in a single idea, what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment? ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors, but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors, and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government. We don't have to give up our liberty to have security. And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives, and I look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen.Thank you very much.CA: Ed, thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1950, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.041\nChris Anderson: The rights of citizens,\n\n00:00:15.041 -->

community,\n\n00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.028\nthings that need to be done,\n\n00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:51.725\nand things that help everyone.\n\n00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:53.682\nBut there are also things that go too far.\n\n00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:54.978\nThere are things that shouldn't be done,\n\n00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:58.046\nand decisions that were being made in secret\n\n00:02:58.046 --> 00:02:59.294\nwithout the public's awareness,\n\n00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:01.806\nwithout the public's consent,\n\n00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.658\nand without even our representatives in government\n\n00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:08.291\nhaving knowledge of these programs.\n\n00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.824\nWhen I really came to struggle with these issues,\n\n00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:14.446\nI thought to myself,\n\n00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:17.532\nhow can I do this in the most responsible way,\n\n00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:20.540\nthat maximizes the public benefit\n\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.251\nwhile minimizing the risks?\n\n00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:26.339\nAnd out of all the solutions that I could come up with,\n\n00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.581\nout of going to Congress,\n\n00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:29.884\nwhen there were no laws,\n\n00:03:29.884 --> 00:03:31.569\nthere were no legal protections\n\n00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.336\nfor a private employee,\n\n00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:36.669\na contractor in intelligence like myself,\n\n00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.316\nthere was a risk that I would be\nburied along with the information\n\n00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:42.223\nand the public would never find out.\n\n00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:45.245\nBut the First Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution\n\n00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:48.786\nguarantees us a free press for a reason,\n\n00:03:48.786 --> 00:03:51.991\nand that's to enable an adversarial press,\n\n00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:53.888\nto challenge the government,\n\n00:03:53.888 --> 00:03:56.522\nbut also to work together with the government,\n\n00:03:56.522 --> 00:03:58.840\nto have a dialogue and debate about how we can\n\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.279\ninform the public about matters of vital importance\n\n00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.409\nwithout putting our national security at risk.\n\n00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.085\nAnd by working with journalists,\n\n00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:11.239\nby giving all of my information\n\n00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.516\nback to the American people,\n\n00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:15.287\nrather than trusting myself to make\n\n00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:18.021\nthe decisions about publication,\n\n00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:20.257\nwe've had a robust debate\n\n00:04:20.257 --> 00:04:23.524\nwith a deep investment by the government\n\n00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:28.630\nthat I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.\n\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.405\nAnd the risks that have been threatened,\n\n00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.538\nthe risks that have been played up\n\n00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.090\nby the government\n\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.516\nhave never materialized.\n\n00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.594\nWe've never seen any evidence\n\n00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:43.150\nof even a single instance of specific harm,\n\n00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.619\nand because of that,\n\n00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.746\nI'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.\n\n00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:48.959\nCA: So let me show the audience\n\n00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:51.428\na couple of examples of what you revealed.\n\n00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:53.340\nIf we could have a slide up, and Ed,\n\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.095\nI don't know whether you can see,\n\n00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:56.209\nthe slides are here.\n\n00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:58.794\nThis is a slide of the PRISM program,\n\n00:04:58.794 --> 00:05:01.263\nand maybe you could tell the audience\n\n00:05:01.263 --> 00:05:03.869\nwhat that was that was revealed.\n\n00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.081\nES: The best way to understand PRISM,\n\n00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:07.542\nbecause there's been a little bit of controversy,\n\n00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:11.293\nis to first talk about what PRISM isn't.\n\n00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:14.048\nMuch of the debate in the U.S.\nhas been about metadata.\n\n00:05:14.048 --> 00:05:16.939\nThey've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,\n\n00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.680\nand they're talking about a specific legal authority\n\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.385\ncalled Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\n\n00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:25.454\nThat allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,\n\n00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:27.817\nmass surveillance of the entire country's\n\n00:05:27.817 --> 00:05:29.974\nphone records, things like that --\n\n00:05:29.974 --> 00:05:31.336\nwho you're talking to,\n\n00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:33.364\nwhen you're talking to them,\n\n00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:34.660\nwhere you traveled.\n\n00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.161\nThese are all metadata events.\n\n00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:40.507\nPRISM is about content.\n\n00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.647\nIt's a program through which the government could\n\n00:05:42.647 --> 00:05:44.691\ncompel corporate America,\n\n00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:48.084\nit could deputize corporate America\n\n00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:51.948\nto do its dirty work for the NSA.\n\n00:05:51.948 --> 00:05:54.944\nAnd even though some of\nthese companies did resist,\n\n00:05:54.944 --> 00:05:56.367\neven though some of them --\n\n00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:57.613\nI believe Yahoo was one of them \u2014\n\n00:05:57.613 --> 00:06:00.270\nchallenged them in court, they all lost,\n\n00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.185\nbecause it was never tried by an open court.\n\n00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:06.316\nThey were only tried by a secret court.\n\n00:06:06.316 --> 00:06:07.683\nAnd something that we've seen,\n\n00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:10.387\nsomething about the PRISM program\nthat's very concerning to me is,\n\n00:06:10.387 --> 00:06:12.366\nthere's been a talking point in the U.S. government\n\n00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:16.117\nwhere they've said 15 federal judges\n\n00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:18.815\nhave reviewed these programs\nand found them to be lawful,\n\n00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:21.535\nbut what they don't tell you\n\n00:06:21.535 --> 00:06:24.165\nis those are secret judges\n\n00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:26.167\nin a secret court\n\n00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:29.241\nbased on secret interpretations of law\n\n00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:33.475\nthat's considered 34,000 warrant requests\n\n00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:35.934\nover 33 years,\n\n00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:38.121\nand in 33 years only rejected\n\n00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.004\n11 government requests.\n\n00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:43.751\nThese aren't the people that we want deciding\n\n00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:45.897\nwhat the role of corporate America\n\n00:06:45.897 --> 00:06:48.353\nin a free and open Internet should be.\n\n00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:50.464\nCA: Now, this slide that we're showing here\n\n00:06:50.464 --> 00:06:52.676\nshows the dates in which\n\n00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:55.091\ndifferent technology companies, Internet companies,\n\n00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:57.445\nare alleged to have joined the program,\n\n00:06:57.445 --> 00:07:00.403\nand where data collection began from them.\n\n00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:05.152\nNow, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.\n\n00:07:05.152 --> 00:07:10.256\nHow was that data collected by the NSA?\n\n00:07:10.256 --> 00:07:13.435\nES: Right. So the NSA's own slides\n\n00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:16.235\nrefer to it as direct access.\n\n00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.985\nWhat that means to an actual NSA analyst,\n\n00:07:18.985 --> 00:07:22.093\nsomeone like me who was working\nas an intelligence analyst\n\n00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:24.564\ntargeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,\n\n00:07:24.564 --> 00:07:26.646\nthings like that, in Hawaii,\n\n00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.615\nis the provenance of that data\n\n00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.871\nis directly from their servers.\n\n00:07:30.871 --> 00:07:32.935\nIt doesn't mean\n\n00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:35.741\nthat there's a group of company representatives\n\n00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:38.178\nsitting in a smoky room with the NSA\n\n00:07:38.178 --> 00:07:39.968\npalling around and making back-room deals\n\n00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:42.511\nabout how they're going to give this stuff away.\n\n00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:44.904\nNow each company handles it different ways.\n\n00:07:44.904 --> 00:07:46.080\nSome are responsible.\n\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.171\nSome are somewhat less responsible.\n\n00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.939\nBut the bottom line is, when we talk about\n\n00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:53.318\nhow this information is given,\n\n00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:55.804\nit's coming from the companies themselves.\n\n00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:58.099\nIt's not stolen from the lines.\n\n00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:00.031\nBut there's an important thing to remember here:\n\n00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:01.962\neven though companies pushed back,\n\n00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:04.015\neven though companies demanded,\n\n00:08:04.015 --> 00:08:06.561\nhey, let's do this through a warrant process,\n\n00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:08.335\nlet's do this\n\n00:08:08.335 --> 00:08:11.484\nwhere we actually have some sort of legal review,\n\n00:08:11.484 --> 00:08:13.315\nsome sort of basis for handing over\n\n00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:15.255\nthese users' data,\n\n00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:17.646\nwe saw stories in the Washington Post last year\n\n00:08:17.646 --> 00:08:20.858\nthat weren't as well reported as the PRISM story\n\n00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:23.457\nthat said the NSA broke in\n\n00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:25.258\nto the data center communications\n\n00:08:25.258 --> 00:08:27.414\nbetween Google to itself\n\n00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:28.992\nand Yahoo to itself.\n\n00:08:28.992 --> 00:08:31.824\nSo even these companies that are cooperating\n\n00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:34.695\nin at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner\n\n00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:36.568\nwith the NSA,\n\n00:08:36.568 --> 00:08:39.864\nthe NSA isn't satisfied with that,\n\n00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:41.842\nand because of that, we need our companies\n\n00:08:41.842 --> 00:08:44.657\nto work very hard\n\n00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.129\nto guarantee that they're going to represent\n\n00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:49.715\nthe interests of the user, and also advocate\n\n00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:51.631\nfor the rights of the users.\n\n00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.905\nAnd I think over the last year,\n\n00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:54.488\nwe've seen the companies that are named\n\n00:08:54.488 --> 00:08:55.906\non the PRISM slides\n\n00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:57.715\ntake great strides to do that,\n\n00:08:57.715 --> 00:08:59.968\nand I encourage them to continue.\n\n00:08:59.968 --> 00:09:02.650\nCA: What more should they do?\n\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.167\nES: The biggest thing that an Internet company\n\n00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:09.393\nin America can do today, right now,\n\n00:09:09.393 --> 00:09:10.835\nwithout consulting with lawyers,\n\n00:09:10.835 --> 00:09:14.374\nto protect the rights of users worldwide,\n\n00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:19.757\nis to enable SSL web encryption\n\n00:09:19.757 --> 00:09:21.762\non every page you visit.\n\n00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:24.704\nThe reason this matters is today,\n\n00:09:24.704 --> 00:09:29.942\nif you go to look at a copy of \"1984\" on Amazon.com,\n\n00:09:29.942 --> 00:09:32.389\nthe NSA can see a record of that,\n\n00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:34.608\nthe Russian intelligence service\ncan see a record of that,\n\n00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:37.065\nthe Chinese service can see a record of that,\n\n00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:38.963\nthe French service, the German service,\n\n00:09:38.963 --> 00:09:40.285\nthe services of Andorra.\n\n00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:43.563\nThey can all see it because it's unencrypted.\n\n00:09:43.563 --> 00:09:47.163\nThe world's library is Amazon.com,\n\n00:09:47.163 --> 00:09:49.818\nbut not only do they not\nsupport encryption by default,\n\n00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:51.984\nyou cannot choose to use encryption\n\n00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:53.711\nwhen browsing through books.\n\n00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:55.420\nThis is something that we need to change,\n\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.295\nnot just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,\n\n00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:58.787\nbut they're a great example.\n\n00:09:58.787 --> 00:10:00.455\nAll companies need to move\n\n00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:03.848\nto an encrypted browsing habit by default\n\n00:10:03.848 --> 00:10:06.332\nfor all users who haven't taken any action\n\n00:10:06.332 --> 00:10:08.593\nor picked any special methods on their own.\n\n00:10:08.593 --> 00:10:10.904\nThat'll increase the privacy and the rights\n\n00:10:10.904 --> 00:10:13.669\nthat people enjoy worldwide.\n\n00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:16.147\nCA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.\n\n00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:19.100\nI want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)\n\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.808\nThis is a program called Boundless Informant.\n\n00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:23.484\nWhat is that?\n\n00:10:23.484 --> 00:10:25.664\nES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA\n\n00:10:25.664 --> 00:10:28.107\nfor using appropriate names on this.\n\n00:10:28.107 --> 00:10:31.952\nThis is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.\n\n00:10:31.952 --> 00:10:33.422\nBoundless Informant\n\n00:10:33.422 --> 00:10:36.272\nis a program that the NSA hid from Congress.\n\n00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:38.681\nThe NSA was previously asked by Congress,\n\n00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:40.894\nwas there any ability that they had\n\n00:10:40.894 --> 00:10:44.652\nto even give a rough ballpark estimate\n\n00:10:44.652 --> 00:10:46.838\nof the amount of American communications\n\n00:10:46.838 --> 00:10:48.972\nthat were being intercepted.\n\n00:10:48.972 --> 00:10:52.003\nThey said no.

00:10:58.119\nwe're intercepting around the world,\n\n00:10:58.119 --> 00:10:59.606\nbecause to tell you that would be\n\n00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:02.913\nto invade your privacy.\n\n00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:05.128\nNow, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,\n\n00:11:05.128 --> 00:11:07.263\nbut the reality, when you look at this slide is,\n\n00:11:07.263 --> 00:11:08.916\nnot only do they have the capability,\n\n00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:11.532\nthe capability already exists.\n\n00:11:11.532 --> 00:11:13.206\nIt's already in place.\n\n00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:16.354\nThe NSA has its own internal data format\n\n00:11:16.354 --> 00:11:20.503\nthat tracks both ends of a communication,\n\n00:11:20.503 --> 00:11:21.785\nand if it says,\n\n00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:23.811\nthis communication

00:15:45.023\nDick Cheney was saying\n\n00:15:45.023 --> 00:15:47.453\nhe was going to end governments worldwide,\n\n00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:50.358\nthe skies were going to ignite\n\n00:15:50.358 -->

assume that these\npeople really believe this.\n\n00:16:09.952 --> 00:16:12.182\nI would argue that they have kind of\n\n00:16:12.182 --> 00:16:16.552\na narrow conception of national

Or another way to say it is, what's the most dangerous  thing that you've ever done? And why did you do it? I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math. You look back to the first five shuttle launches, the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight, the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so \u2014 one in 35, one in 40. Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you're either going to be floating  effortlessly, gloriously in space, or you'll be dead. You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center, the suit-up room, the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in, that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon. And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad \u2014 in the Astro van \u2014 heading out to the launchpad, and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center, it's normally predawn, and in the distance, lit up by the huge xenon lights, is your spaceship \u2014 the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet. The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed, almost holding hands, looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger. We ride the elevator up and we crawl in, on your hands and knees into the spaceship, one at a time, and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back. And the hatch is closed, and suddenly, what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real, something that I dreamed about, in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old, is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening. In the astronaut business \u2014 the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle; it's the most complicated flying machine ever built. And in the astronaut business,  we have a saying, which is, there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse. (Laughter) And so you're very conscious in the cockpit; you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do, all the switches and all the  wickets you have to go through. And as the time gets closer and closer, this excitement is building. And then about three and a  half minutes before launch, the huge nozzles on the back, like the size of big church bells, swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle, like the vehicle is alive underneath you, like an elephant getting up  off its knees or something. And then about 30 seconds before launch, the vehicle is completely alive \u2014 it is ready to go \u2014 the APUs are running, the computers are all self-contained, it's ready to leave the planet. And 15 seconds before launch, this happens: (Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six \u2014 (Space shuttle preparing for takeoff) \u2014 start, two, one, booster ignition, and liftoff of  the space shuttle Discovery, returning to the space station, paving the way ... (Space shuttle taking off)Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things. You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself. It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you. It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space, accelerating wildly straight up, shouldering your way through the air, and you're in a very complex place \u2014 paying attention, watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face. After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines, the hydrogen and oxygen, and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated. You get lighter and lighter, the force gets on us heavier and heavier. It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something. Until finally, after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so, we are finally at exactly the right altitude, exactly the right speed, the right direction, the engine shut off, and we're weightless. And we're alive.It's an amazing experience. But why would we take that risk? Why would you do something that dangerous?In my case the answer is fairly straightforward. I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me, it was just an obvious thing \u2014 I want to somehow turn myself into that. But the real question is, how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it? How do you deal with fear versus danger? And having the goal in mind, thinking about where it might lead, directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible, to be able to launch and go  help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second, eight kilometers a second, around the world 16 times a day, with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside. But maybe even more importantly, allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means, to be able to look down and have \u2014 if your jaw could drop, it would \u2014 the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic, constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. And you see, because of the speed, a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are in a one-person spaceship that is your spacesuit, and you're going through space with the world. It's an entirely different perspective, you're not looking up at the universe, you and the Earth are going  through the universe together. And you're holding on with one hand, looking at the world turn beside you. It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you. And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything, it's unfathomable blackness, with a texture you feel like you  could stick your hand into. and you are holding on with one hand, one link to the other seven billion people. And I was outside on my first spacewalkwhen my left eye went blind, and I didn't know why. Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working. I was thinking, what do I do next? I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes, so I kept working. But unfortunately, without gravity, tears don't fall. So you just get a bigger and  bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually, the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it  across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes \"goosh\" into your other eye, and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship.So what's the scariest thing you've ever done? (Laughter) Maybe it's spiders. A lot of people are afraid of spiders. I think you should be afraid of spiders \u2014 spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs, and spiders like this one, the brown recluse \u2014 it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you, you end with one of these  horrible, big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you, in fact. And how do you know? And so a spider lands on you, and you go through this great, spasmy attack because spiders are scary. But then you could say, well  is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not? I don't know. Are there brown recluses here? So if you actually do the research, you find out that in the world there are about  50,000 different types of spiders, and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000. And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there's about 720,  730 different types of spiders and there's one \u2014 one \u2014 that is venomous, and its venom isn't even fatal, it's just kind of like a nasty sting. And that spider \u2014 not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it's like \"I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation  symbol on my back, it's the black widow.\" So, if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider \u2014 and it lives close the ground, you're walking along, you are  never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you. Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those, it builds them down in the corners. And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male; it doesn't care about you. So in fact, the next time you walk into a spiderweb, you don't need to panic and go  with your caveman reaction. The danger is entirely different than the fear.How do you get around it, though? How do you change your behavior? Well, next time you see a spiderweb, have a good look, make sure  it's not a black widow spider, and then walk into it. And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one. It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal. And the spider that may come out is  no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. And then I guarantee you if you  walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior, your caveman reaction, and you will now be able to walk  in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb \u2014 or into your grandma's attic or whatever, into your own basement. And you can apply this to anything.If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded, your natural reaction would be to panic, I think. It would make you nervous and worried. But we had considered all the venom, and we had practiced with a whole  variety of different spiderwebs. We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times. And we don't just practice things going right, we practice things going wrong all the time, so that you are constantly walking  through those spiderwebs. And not just underwater, but  also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic. So when you finally actually  get outside on a spacewalk, it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. And even if you're blinded, your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen. Instead you kind of look around and go, \"Okay, I can't see, but I can hear, I can talk, Scott Parazynski is out here with me. He could come over and help me.\" We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue, so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to. I could find my own way back. It's not nearly as big a deal. And actually, if you keep on crying for a while, whatever that gunk was that's  in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again, and Houston, if you negotiate with them, they will let you then keep working. We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside, Jeff got some cotton batting and took  the crusty stuff around my eyes, and it turned out it was just the anti-fog, sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye. And now we use Johnson's No More Tears, which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning. (Laughter)But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger, where is the real risk? What is the real thing that you should be afraid of? Not just a generic fear of bad things happening. You can fundamentally change  your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...where you could see the  hardpan south of the Sahara, or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike, or the unconscious gingham  of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles. You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge, just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened.It's time to come home at the end. This is our spaceship, the Soyuz, that little one. Three of us climb in, and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere. These two parts here actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere. The only part that survives is the little bullet that we're riding in, and it falls into the atmosphere, and in essence you are riding a meteorite home, and riding meteorites is scary, and it ought to be. But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming, like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 instead, 20 years previously we had started studying Russian, and then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian, and then we learned vehicle control theory, and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. And in fact, you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth. So in fact, when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz, we weren't screaming, we were laughing; it was fun. And when the great big parachute opened, we knew that if it didn't open there's a second parachute, and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism. So we came back, we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan. (Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters, once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi-8 helicopters. Touchdown \u2014 3:14 and 48 seconds, a.m. Central Time. CH: And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your  spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end, but you're ready for it you're in a custom-built seat, you know how the shock absorber works. And then eventually the Russians reach in, drag you out, plunk you into a chair, and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience. You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy, which were impossible and dauntingly scary, dauntingly terrifying, and put them into practice, and figured out a way to reprogram yourself, to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar. I know this song, and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself, but it's also, I think, a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe, we are people, and we're taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place.

gorgeousness of the turning orb\n\n00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:43.658\nlike a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,\n\n00:06:43.658 --> 00:06:47.369\nconstantly changing beauty that is the world itself.\n\n00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:48.904\nAnd you see, because of the speed,\n\n00:06:48.904 --> 00:06:52.730\na sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes\n\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.899\nfor half a year.\n\n00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.350\nAnd the most magnificent part of all that\n\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.149\nis to go outside on a spacewalk.\n\n00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:06.557\nYou are in a one-person spaceship\n\n00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:08.025\nthat is your spacesuit,\n\n00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:11.789\nand you're going through space with the world.\n\n00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:13.542\nIt's an entirely different perspective,\n\n00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:14.957\nyou're not looking up at the universe,\n\n00:07:14.957 --> 00:07:18.439\nyou and the Earth are going \nthrough the universe together.\n\n00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.238\nAnd you're holding on with one hand,\n\n00:07:20.238 --> 00:07:22.362\nlooking at the world turn beside you.\n\n00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:26.154\nIt's roaring silently\n\n00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.923\nwith color and texture as it pours by\n\n00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:30.899\nmesmerizingly next to you.\n\n00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:33.585\nAnd if you can tear your eyes away from that\n\n00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:35.047\nand you look under your arm\n\n00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:37.285\ndown at the rest of everything,\n\n00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:42.682\nit's unfathomable blackness,\n\n00:07:42.682 --> 00:07:45.750\nwith a texture you feel like you \ncould stick your hand into.\n\n00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.165\nand you are holding on with one hand,\n\n00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:50.590\none link to the other seven billion people.\n\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.728\nAnd I was outside on my first spacewalk\n\n00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:56.504\nwhen my left eye went blind,\n\n00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:58.174\nand I didn't know why.\n\n00:07:58.174 --> 00:07:59.784\nSuddenly my left eye slammed shut\n\n00:07:59.784 --> 00:08:00.908\nin great pain\n\n00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:04.967\nand I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.\n\n00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:06.323\nI was thinking, what do I do next?\n\n00:08:06.323 --> 00:08:08.578\nI thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,\n\n00:08:08.578 --> 00:08:09.831\nso I kept working.\n\n00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.170\nBut unfortunately, without gravity,\n\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.100\ntears don't fall.\n\n00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.124\nSo you just get a bigger and \nbigger ball of whatever that is\n\n00:08:18.124 --> 00:08:20.132\nmixed with your tears on your eye\n\n00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.610\nuntil eventually, the ball becomes so big\n\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.171\nthat the surface tension takes it \nacross the bridge of your nose\n\n00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.905\nlike a tiny little waterfall\n\n00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:28.980\nand goes \"goosh\" into your other eye,\n\n00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:32.448\nand now I was completely blind\n\n00:08:32.448 --> 00:08:35.546\noutside the spaceship.\n\n00:08:35.546 --> 00:08:38.125\nSo what's the scariest thing you've ever done?\n\n00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:41.827\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:41.827 --> 00:08:43.307\nMaybe it's spiders.\n\n00:08:43.307 --> 00:08:44.836\nA lot of people are afraid of spiders.\n\n00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:46.565\nI think you should be afraid of spiders --\n\n00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:49.248\nspiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,\n\n00:08:49.248 --> 00:08:52.675\nand spiders like this one, the brown recluse --\n\n00:08:52.675 --> 00:08:54.817\nit's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,\n\n00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:56.551\nyou end with one of these \nhorrible, big necrotic things\n\n00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:57.654\non your leg\n\n00:08:57.654 --> 00:08:58.907\nand there might be one right now\n\n00:08:58.907 --> 00:09:01.985\nsitting on the chair behind you, in fact.\n\n00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:03.070\nAnd how do you know?\n\n00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.444\nAnd so a spider lands on you,\n\n00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:06.485\nand you go through this great, spasmy attack\n\n00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:08.213\nbecause spiders are scary.\n\n00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:10.717\nBut then you could say, well \nis there a brown recluse\n\n00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.092\nsitting on the chair beside me or not?\n\n00:09:12.092 --> 00:09:14.106\nI don't know. Are there brown recluses here?\n\n00:09:14.106 --> 00:09:16.789\nSo if you actually do the research, you find out that\n\n00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:19.834\nin the world there are about \n50,000 different types of spiders,\n\n00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:22.509\nand there are about two dozen that are venomous\n\n00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:23.860\nout of 50,000.\n\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.228\nAnd if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters\n\n00:09:26.228 --> 00:09:30.708\nhere in B.C., there's about 720, \n730 different types of spiders\n\n00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.610\nand there's one -- one --\n\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.469\nthat is venomous,\n\n00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:35.175\nand its venom isn't even fatal,\n\n00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.076\nit's just kind of like a nasty sting.\n\n00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.001\nAnd that spider -- not only that,\n\n00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:42.214\nbut that spider has beautiful markings on it,\n\n00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:46.362\nit's like \"I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation \nsymbol on my back, it's the black widow.\"\n\n00:09:46.362 --> 00:09:48.620\nSo, if you're even slightly careful\n\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.062\nyou can avoid running into the one spider --\n\n00:09:51.062 --> 00:09:53.208\nand it lives close the ground,\n\n00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:55.660\nyou're walking along, you are \nnever going to go through\n\n00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.510\na spider web where a black widow bites you.\n\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.483\nSpider webs like this, it doesn't build those,\n\n00:09:59.483 --> 00:10:01.113\nit builds them down in the corners.\n\n00:10:01.113 --> 00:10:02.705\nAnd its a black widow because\n\n00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:04.044\nthe female spider eats the male;\n\n00:10:04.044 --> 00:10:05.835\nit doesn't care about you.\n\n00:10:05.835 --> 00:10:07.300\nSo in fact,\n\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.599\nthe next time you walk into a spiderweb,\n\n00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:13.474\nyou don't need to panic and go \nwith your caveman reaction.\n\n00:10:13.474 --> 00:10:18.063\nThe danger is entirely different than the fear.\n\n00:10:18.063 --> 00:10:20.396\nHow do you get around it, though?\n\n00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:21.650\nHow do you change your behavior?\n\n00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.134\nWell, next time you see a spiderweb,\n\n00:10:23.134 --> 00:10:25.348\nhave a good look, make sure \nit's not a black widow spider,\n\n00:10:25.348 --> 00:10:27.140\nand then walk into it.\n\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.778\nAnd then you see another spiderweb\n\n00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:30.000\nand walk into that one.\n\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.246\nIt's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.\n\n00:10:32.246 --> 00:10:35.762\nAnd the spider that may come out is \nno more threat to you than a lady bug\n\n00:10:35.762 --> 00:10:38.630\nor a butterfly.\n\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.558\nAnd then I guarantee you if you \nwalk through 100 spiderwebs\n\n00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:43.146\nyou will have changed\n\n00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.701\nyour fundamental human behavior,\n\n00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:47.206\nyour caveman reaction,\n\n00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:50.033\nand you will now be able to walk \nin the park in the morning\n\n00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:51.822\nand not worry about that spiderweb --\n\n00:10:51.822 --> 00:10:54.282\nor into your grandma's attic or whatever,\n\n00:10:54.282 --> 00:10:59.367\ninto your own basement.\n\n00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:02.878\nAnd you can apply this to anything.\n\n00:11:02.878 --> 00:11:05.693\nIf you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,\n\n00:11:05.693 --> 00:11:08.317\nyour natural reaction would be to panic, I think.\n\n00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:10.377\nIt would make you nervous and worried.\n\n00:11:10.377 --> 00:11:12.865\nBut we had considered all the venom,\n\n00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:15.746\nand we had practiced with a whole \nvariety of different spiderwebs.\n\n00:11:15.746 --> 00:11:17.480\nWe knew everything there is to know\n\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.938\nabout the spacesuit\n\n00:11:18.938 --> 00:11:21.451\nand we trained underwater thousands of times.\n\n00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:23.182\nAnd we don't just practice things going right,\n\n00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.006\nwe practice things going wrong all the time,\n\n00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:29.270\nso that you are constantly walking \nthrough those spiderwebs.\n\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.347\nAnd not just underwater, but \nalso in virtual reality labs\n\n00:11:32.347 --> 00:11:33.738\nwith the helmet and the gloves\n\n00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:35.145\nso you feel like it's realistic.\n\n00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:38.473\nSo when you finally actually \nget outside on a spacewalk,\n\n00:11:38.473 --> 00:11:40.435\nit feels much different than it would\n\n00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:42.273\nif you just went out first time.\n\n00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:44.034\nAnd even if you're blinded,\n\n00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:47.680\nyour natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.\n\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.039\nInstead you kind of look around and go,\n\n00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:50.691\n\"Okay, I can't see,\n\n00:11:50.691 --> 00:11:53.113\nbut I can hear, I can talk,\n\n00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:54.842\nScott Parazynski is out here with me.\n\n00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:56.273\nHe could come over and help me.\"\n\n00:11:56.273 --> 00:12:00.187\nWe actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,\n\n00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:01.978\nso he could float me like a blimp\n\n00:12:01.978 --> 00:12:04.153\nand stuff me into the airlock if he had to.\n\n00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:06.353\nI could find my own way back.\n\n00:12:06.353 --> 00:12:07.723\nIt's not nearly as big a deal.\n\n00:12:07.723 --> 00:12:09.745\nAnd actually, if you keep on crying for a while,\n\n00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:12.140\nwhatever that gunk was that's \nin your eye starts to dilute\n\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.660\nand you can start to see again,\n\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.727\nand Houston, if you negotiate with them,\n\n00:12:15.727 --> 00:12:18.724\nthey will let you then keep working.\n\n00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:20.783\nWe finished everything on the spacewalk\n\n00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:22.380\nand when we came back inside,\n\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.103\nJeff got some cotton batting and took \nthe crusty stuff around my eyes,\n\n00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:28.555\nand it turned out it was just the anti-fog,\n\n00:12:28.555 --> 00:12:32.002\nsort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.\n\n00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:35.550\nAnd now we use Johnson's No More Tears,\n\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.865\nwhich we probably should've been using\n\n00:12:36.865 --> 00:12:40.501\nright from the very beginning. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:45.447\nBut the key to that is\n\n00:12:45.447 --> 00:12:47.002\nby looking at the difference\n\n00:12:47.002 --> 00:12:48.997\nbetween perceived danger and actual danger,\n\n00:12:48.997 --> 00:12:50.364\nwhere is the real risk?\n\n00:12:50.364 --> 00:12:52.418\nWhat is the real thing that you should be afraid of?\n\n00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:55.186\nNot just a generic fear of bad things happening.\n\n00:12:55.186 --> 00:12:57.553\nYou can fundamentally change \nyour reaction to things\n\n00:12:57.553 --> 00:13:00.490\nso that it allows you to go places\n\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.127\nand see things and do things\n\n00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:04.623\nthat otherwise would be completely denied to you ...\n\n00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:07.970\nwhere you could see the \nhardpan south of the Sahara,\n\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.922\nor you can see New York City\n\n00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:12.021\nin a way that is almost dreamlike,\n\n00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:16.544\nor the unconscious gingham \nof Eastern Europe fields\n\n00:13:16.544 --> 00:13:18.675\nor the Great Lakes\n\n00:13:18.675 --> 00:13:21.416\nas a collection of small puddles.\n\n00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:24.661\nYou can see the fault lines of San Francisco\n\n00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:26.559\nand the way the water pours out under the bridge,\n\n00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.291\njust entirely different\n\n00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:29.960\nthan any other way that you could have\n\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.243\nif you had not found a way to conquer your fear.\n\n00:13:33.243 --> 00:13:35.682\nYou see a beauty that otherwise\n\n00:13:35.682 --> 00:13:38.159\nnever would have happened.\n\n00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.406\nIt's time to come home at the end.\n\n00:13:41.406 --> 00:13:42.725\nThis is our spaceship,\n\n00:13:42.725 --> 00:13:43.832\nthe Soyuz, that little one.\n\n00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:45.297\nThree of us climb in,\n\n00:13:45.297 --> 00:13:47.749\nand then this spaceship detaches from the station\n\n00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:49.419\nand falls into the atmosphere.\n\n00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:51.041\nThese two parts here\n\n00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:53.205\nactually melt, we jettison them and they burn up\n\n00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:54.287\nin the atmosphere.\n\n00:13:54.287 --> 00:13:56.540\nThe only part that survives is the little bullet\n\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.716\nthat we're riding in,\n\n00:13:57.716 --> 00:13:59.754\nand it falls into the atmosphere,\n\n00:13:59.754 --> 00:14:01.330\nand in essence\n\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.891\nyou are riding a meteorite home,\n\n00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:07.824\nand riding meteorites is scary,\n\n00:14:07.824 --> 00:14:09.337\nand it ought to be.\n\n00:14:09.337 --> 00:14:11.576\nBut instead of riding into the atmosphere\n\n00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:12.814\njust screaming, like you would\n\n00:14:12.814 --> 00:14:15.159\nif suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite\n\n00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:18.089\nback to Earth -- (Laughter) --\n\n00:14:18.089 --> 00:14:20.513\ninstead, 20 years previously\n\n00:14:20.513 --> 00:14:23.129\nwe had started studying Russian,\n\n00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:25.709\nand then once you learn Russian, then we\n\n00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:28.223\nlearned orbital mechanics in Russian,\n\n00:14:28.223 --> 00:14:31.193\nand then we learned vehicle control theory,\n\n00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:32.662\nand then we got into the simulator\n\n00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:35.234\nand practiced over and over and over again.\n\n00:14:35.234 --> 00:14:37.244\nAnd in fact, you can fly this meteorite\n\n00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:39.453\nand steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle\n\n00:14:39.453 --> 00:14:40.877\nanywhere on the Earth.\n\n00:14:40.877 --> 00:14:43.802\nSo in fact, when our crew was coming back\n\n00:14:43.802 --> 00:14:46.362\ninto the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,\n\n00:14:46.362 --> 00:14:48.738\nwe weren't screaming, we were laughing;\n\n00:14:48.738 --> 00:14:49.806\nit was fun.\n\n00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.734\nAnd when the great big parachute opened,\n\n00:14:51.734 --> 00:14:52.953\nwe knew that if it didn't open\n\n00:14:52.953 --> 00:14:54.168\nthere's a second parachute,\n\n00:14:54.168 --> 00:14:56.349\nand it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.\n\n00:14:56.349 --> 00:14:58.731\nSo we came back, we came thundering back\n\n00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.617\nto Earth and this is what it looked like\n\n00:15:00.617 --> 00:15:03.217\nto land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.\n\n00:15:03.217 --> 00:15:05.240\n(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those\n\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.956\nsearch and recovery helicopters, once again\n\n00:15:07.956 --> 00:15:10.967\nthat helicopter part of

It's a very simple yet devastating problem, one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us. The problem is anonymous companies. It sounds like a really dry and technical thing, doesn't it? But anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes. So, why am I here talking to all of you? Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority, I don't think they knew where it might lead. (Laughter) And, they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably, I questioned their authority a lot. And a lot of my school teachers didn't appreciate it much either. You see, since the age of about five I've always asked the question, but why? But why does the Earth go around the sun? But why is blood red? But why do I have to go to school? But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority? And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do. And so it was in my twenties, a long time ago, that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London I was sitting with Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group where we worked at the time. And as usual, we were talking  about the world's problems. And in particular, we were talking about the civil war in Cambodia. And we had talked about that  many, many times before. But then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other and said, but why don't we try and change this? And from that slightly crazy question, over two decades and many campaigns later, including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war, from that crazy question, Global Witness is now an 80-strong team of campaigners, investigators,  journalists and lawyers. And we're all driven by the same belief, that change really is possible.So, what exactly does Global Witness do? We investigate, we report, to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict \u2014 for stealing millions from citizens around the world, also known as state looting, and for destroying the environment. And then we campaign hard to  change the system itself. And we're doing this because  so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet. And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices. And one of these is anonymous companies. Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations, like in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars. That's twice the country's health  and education budget combined. Or in Liberia, where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests. Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia, which has led to the destruction  of much of its forests. Well, that uses anonymous companies too. We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies. And the awful thing is, there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life. This truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight. Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel, the Zetas, who use anonymous companies  to launder profits while their drugs-related violence is tearing communities apart across the Americas. Or the anonymous company, which bought up Americans' tax debts, piled on the legal fees and then gave homeowners a choice: Pay up or lose your home. Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars, and not being able to find out who you were really up against.Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too. As the Iranian government found out when, through a series of front companies, it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan, on Fifth Avenue, despite American sanctions. And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit, and other companies were the unwitting, unknowing tenants there. There are just so many examples, the horesemeat scandal in Europe, the Italian mafia, they've used these companies for decades. The $100 million American Medicare fraud, the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in Eastern Europe in the early '90s. Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine.But, for every case that we and others expose there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system. And it's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible  for outrageous crimes, for stealing from you and me and millions of others, they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they're doing this with ease, and they're doing it using legal structures. And really, that is unfair. Well, you might well ask, what exactly is an anonymous company, and can I really set one up, and use it, without anyone knowing who I am? Well, the answer is, yes you can. But if you're anything like me, you'll want to see some of that for yourself, so let me show you. Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up. Now, at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here's the thing, shockingly, my own hometown, London, and indeed the U.K., is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company. And the other, even better, I'm afraid that's America. Do you know, in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card, like Delaware, which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company.Okay, so let's say it's America, and let's say it's Delaware, and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider. These are the companies that  can set your one up for you, and remember, it's all legal, routine business practice. So, here's one, but there are plenty of others to choose from. And having made your choice, you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact, name and address. But don't worry, it doesn't have to be your name. It can be your lawyer's or your service provider's, and it's not for the public record anyway. And then you add the owner of the company. Now this is the key part, and again it doesn't have to be you, because you can get creative, because there is a whole universe  out there of nominees to choose from. And nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company's owner. And if you don't want to involve anyone else, it doesn't even have to be an actual human being. It could be another company. And then finally, give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment. And then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it. But there you are, in 10 minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company. And not only is it easy, really, really easy and cheap, it's totally legal too. But the fun doesn't have to end there, maybe you want to be even more anonymous. Well, that's no problem either. You can simply keep adding layers, companies owned by companies. You can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries, like a giant web, each layer adds anonymity. Each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is. But whose interests is this all serving? It might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual, but what about all of us, the public? There hasn't even been a global conversation yet about whether it's okay to misuse companies in this way. And what does it all mean for us?Well, an example that really haunts me is one I came across recently. And it's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in Buenos Aires about a decade ago. It was the night before New Year's Eve. Three thousand very happy revelers, many of them teenagers, were crammed into a space meant for 1,000. And then tragedy struck, a fire broke out plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling and toxic smoke filled the club. So people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut. Over 200 people died. Seven hundred were injured trying to get out. And as the victims' families  and the city and the country reeled in shock, investigators tried to find out who was responsible. And as they looked for the owners of the club, they found instead anonymous companies, and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies. Now ultimately, a range of people were charged and some went to jail. But this was an awful tragedy, and it shouldn't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths. Because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open, why should this crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away? Why should tax evaders, corrupt  government officials, arms traders and more, be able to hide their identities from us, the public? Why should this secrecy be such  an accepted business practice? Anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it wasn't always this way. Companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line. Companies were created to limit financial risk, they were never intended to  be used as a moral shield. Companies were never intended to be anonymous, and they don't have to be.And so I come to my wish. My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good. Together let's ignite world opinion, change the law, and launch a new era of openness in business. So what might this look like? Well, imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company. Imagine if this data were open and free, accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike. Imagine what a game changer that would be. So how are we going to do this? Well, there is only one way. Together, we have to change the law globally to create public registries which list the true owners of companies and can be accessed by all with no loopholes. And yes, this is ambitious, but there is momentum on this issue, and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum, and it's just starting on this issue. There is such an opportunity right now. And the TED community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference. You really can make this change happen. Now, a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word. It's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning. And the techies among you, you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be. Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue. The U.K. government is already on board; it supports these public registries. And just last week, the European Parliament came on board with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries. That is momentum. (Applause) But it's early days. America still needs to come on board, as do so many other countries. And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians, because without that, real far-reaching, world-shifting change just isn't going to happen. Because this isn't just about changing the law, this is about starting a conversation about what it's okay for companies to do, and in what ways is it acceptable  to use company structures. This isn't just a dry policy issue. This is a human issue which affects us all. This is about being on the right side of history. Global citizens, innovators,  business leaders, individuals, we need you. Together, let's kickstart this global movement. Let's just do it, let's end anonymous companies. Thank you.

from that slightly crazy question,\n\n00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.051\nover two decades\n\n00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.317\nand many campaigns later,\n\n00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:29.108\nincluding alerting the world\n\n00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.324\nto the problem of blood diamonds funding war,\n\n00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:34.385\nfrom that crazy question,\n\n00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:37.246\nGlobal Witness is now an 80-strong team\n\n00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:41.768\nof campaigners, investigators, \njournalists and lawyers.\n\n00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:44.071\nAnd we're all driven by the same belief,\n\n00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.535\nthat change really is possible.\n\n00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.654\nSo, what exactly does Global Witness do?\n\n00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:53.888\nWe investigate, we report,\n\n00:02:53.888 --> 00:02:56.610\nto uncover the people really responsible\n\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.523\nfor funding conflict --\n\n00:02:58.523 --> 00:03:02.034\nfor stealing millions from citizens around the world,\n\n00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:03.871\nalso known as state looting,\n\n00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.480\nand for destroying the environment.\n\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.644\nAnd then we campaign hard to \nchange the system itself.\n\n00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:14.405\nAnd we're doing this because \nso many of the countries\n\n00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:16.281\nrich in natural resources\n\n00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:18.993\nlike oil or diamonds or timber\n\n00:03:18.993 --> 00:03:21.497\nare home to some of the poorest\n\n00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:25.897\nand most dispossessed people on the planet.\n\n00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:27.391\nAnd much of this injustice\n\n00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:29.045\nis made possible\n\n00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:32.777\nby currently accepted business practices.\n\n00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:36.994\nAnd one of these is anonymous companies.\n\n00:03:36.994 --> 00:03:39.088\nNow we've come up against anonymous companies\n\n00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:41.228\nin lots of our investigations,\n\n00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:43.910\nlike in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\n\n00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.662\nwhere we exposed how secretive deals\n\n00:03:46.662 --> 00:03:48.295\ninvolving anonymous companies\n\n00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.480\nhad deprived the citizens\n\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.445\nof one of the poorest countries on the planet\n\n00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:56.321\nof well over a billion dollars.\n\n00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:01.852\nThat's twice the country's health \nand education budget combined.\n\n00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:03.173\nOr in Liberia,\n\n00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:06.021\nwhere an international predatory logging company\n\n00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:08.584\nused front companies as it attempted to grab\n\n00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:12.773\na really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.\n\n00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:15.856\nOr political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,\n\n00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:19.051\nwhich has led to the destruction \nof much of its forests.\n\n00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:23.192\nWell, that uses anonymous companies too.\n\n00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:25.481\nWe secretly filmed some of the family\n\n00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.278\nof the former chief minister and a lawyer\n\n00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:30.550\nas they told our undercover investigator\n\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.302\nexactly how these dubious deals are done\n\n00:04:33.302 --> 00:04:36.378\nusing such companies.\n\n00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:38.151\nAnd the awful thing is,\n\n00:04:38.151 --> 00:04:41.457\nthere are so many other examples out there\n\n00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:45.461\nfrom all walks of life.\n\n00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:49.679\nThis truly is a scandal of epic proportions\n\n00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:52.444\nhidden in plain sight.\n\n00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:55.223\nWhether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,\n\n00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:56.266\nthe Zetas,\n\n00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:58.920\nwho use anonymous companies \nto launder profits\n\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.866\nwhile their drugs-related violence\n\n00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:05.484\nis tearing communities apart across the Americas.\n\n00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:07.432\nOr the anonymous company,\n\n00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.703\nwhich bought up Americans' tax debts,\n\n00:05:09.703 --> 00:05:11.495\npiled on the legal fees\n\n00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:12.879\nand then gave homeowners a choice:\n\n00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.893\nPay up or lose your home.\n\n00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:18.571\nImagine being threatened with losing your home\n\n00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:21.285\nsometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,\n\n00:05:21.285 --> 00:05:22.655\nand not being able to find out\n\n00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:26.191\nwho you were really up against.\n\n00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:27.630\nNow anonymous companies\n\n00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.504\nare great for sanctions busting too.\n\n00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.050\nAs the Iranian government found out\n\n00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.885\nwhen, through a series of front companies,\n\n00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:37.978\nit owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,\n\n00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:40.272\non Fifth Avenue,\n\n00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:43.167\ndespite American sanctions.\n\n00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:46.301\nAnd Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,\n\n00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.030\nand other companies were the unwitting,\n\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.137\nunknowing tenants there.\n\n00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:54.268\nThere are just so many examples,\n\n00:05:54.268 --> 00:05:56.724\nthe horesemeat scandal in Europe,\n\n00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:59.221\nthe Italian mafia, they've used these companies\n\n00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:01.010\nfor decades.\n\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.769\nThe $100 million American Medicare fraud,\n\n00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:10.541\nthe supply of weapons to wars around the world\n\n00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:11.568\nincluding those\n\n00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:14.354\nin Eastern Europe in the early '90s.\n\n00:06:14.354 --> 00:06:15.632\nAnonymous companies\n\n00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:17.288\nhave even come to light\n\n00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:21.654\nin the recent revolution in the Ukraine.\n\n00:06:21.654 --> 00:06:26.159\nBut, for every case that we and others expose\n\n00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.376\nthere are so many more that will remain hidden away\n\n00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:31.773\nbecause of the current system.\n\n00:06:31.773 --> 00:06:33.732\nAnd it's just a simple truth\n\n00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:38.349\nthat some of the people responsible \nfor outrageous crimes,\n\n00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.589\nfor stealing from you and me\n\n00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:42.633\nand millions of others,\n\n00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:43.816\nthey are remaining faceless\n\n00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:46.301\nand they are escaping accountability\n\n00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:48.473\nand they're doing this with ease,\n\n00:06:48.473 --> 00:06:51.888\nand they're doing it using legal structures.\n\n00:06:51.888 --> 00:06:56.909\nAnd really, that is unfair.\n\n00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.848\nWell, you might well ask,\n\n00:06:58.848 --> 00:07:01.742\nwhat exactly is an anonymous company,\n\n00:07:01.742 --> 00:07:04.150\nand can I really set one up, and use it,\n\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.878\nwithout anyone knowing who I am?\n\n00:07:06.878 --> 00:07:08.609\nWell, the answer is, yes you can.\n\n00:07:08.609 --> 00:07:10.324\nBut if you're anything like me,\n\n00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:12.336\nyou'll want to see some of that for yourself,\n\n00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:14.044\nso let me show you.\n\n00:07:14.044 --> 00:07:15.361\nWell first you need to work out\n\n00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:17.399\nwhere you want to set it up.\n\n00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.376\nNow, at this point you might be imagining\n\n00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:22.894\none of those lovely tropical island tax havens\n\n00:07:22.894 --> 00:07:24.899\nbut here's the thing,\n\n00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.096\nshockingly,\n\n00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:28.440\nmy own hometown, London,\n\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.769\nand indeed the U.K.,\n\n00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:32.491\nis one of the best places in the world\n\n00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:35.395\nto set up an anonymous company.\n\n00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:38.084\nAnd the other, even better,\n\n00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:42.007\nI'm afraid that's America.\n\n00:07:42.007 --> 00:07:44.463\nDo you know, in some states across America\n\n00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:46.780\nyou need less identification\n\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.247\nto open up a company\n\n00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:51.364\nthan you do to get a library card,\n\n00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:52.620\nlike Delaware,\n\n00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.702\nwhich is one of the easiest places\n\n00:07:54.702 --> 00:07:58.941\nin the world to set up an anonymous company.\n\n00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:00.542\nOkay, so let's say it's America,\n\n00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.617\nand let's say it's Delaware,\n\n00:08:02.617 --> 00:08:04.480\nand now you can simply go online\n\n00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.578\nand find yourself a company service provider.\n\n00:08:07.578 --> 00:08:10.561\nThese are the companies that \ncan set your one up for you,\n\n00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:14.703\nand remember, it's all legal,\nroutine business practice.\n\n00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.342\nSo, here's one,\n\n00:08:16.342 --> 00:08:19.269\nbut there are plenty of others to choose from.\n\n00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:20.900\nAnd having made your choice,\n\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.406\nyou then pick what type of company you want\n\n00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:26.522\nand then fill in a contact, name and address.\n\n00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:27.706\nBut don't worry,\n\n00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:29.265\nit doesn't have to be your name.\n\n00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:30.747\nIt can be your lawyer's\n\n00:08:30.747 --> 00:08:32.646\nor your service provider's,\n\n00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:36.481\nand it's not for the public record anyway.\n\n00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:39.038\nAnd then you add the owner of the company.\n\n00:08:39.038 --> 00:08:40.977\nNow this is the key part,\n\n00:08:40.977 --> 00:08:42.857\nand again it doesn't have to be you,\n\n00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:44.960\nbecause you can get creative,\n\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.509\nbecause there is a whole universe \nout there of nominees\n\n00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:50.356\nto choose from.\n\n00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:52.692\nAnd nominees are the people that you\n\n00:08:52.692 --> 00:08:57.528\ncan legally pay to be your company's owner.\n\n00:08:57.528 --> 00:08:59.370\nAnd if you don't want to involve anyone else,\n\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.233\nit doesn't even have to be an actual human being.\n\n00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:05.321\nIt could be another company.\n\n00:09:05.321 --> 00:09:06.751\nAnd then finally,\n\n00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.480\ngive your company a name\n\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.211\nadd a few more details and make your payment.\n\n00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:12.631\nAnd then the service provider\n\n00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:15.414\nwill take a few hours or more to process it.\n\n00:09:15.414 --> 00:09:16.653\nBut there you are,\n\n00:09:16.653 --> 00:09:19.033\nin 10 minutes of online shopping\n\n00:09:19.033 --> 00:09:23.247\nyou can create yourself an anonymous company.\n\n00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:24.635\nAnd not only is it easy,\n\n00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:27.242\nreally, really easy and cheap,\n\n00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:29.530\nit's totally legal too.\n\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.254\nBut the fun doesn't have to end there,\n\n00:09:33.254 --> 00:09:36.053\nmaybe you want to be even more anonymous.\n\n00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:38.156\nWell, that's no problem either.\n\n00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:40.914\nYou can simply keep adding layers,\n\n00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.014\ncompanies owned by companies.\n\n00:09:43.014 --> 00:09:44.394\nYou can have hundreds of layers\n\n00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:46.482\nwith hundreds of companies spread across\n\n00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:49.139\nlots of different countries,\n\n00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:50.469\nlike a giant web,\n\n00:09:50.469 --> 00:09:52.658\neach layer adds anonymity.\n\n00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.888\nEach layer makes it more difficult\n\n00:09:54.888 --> 00:09:56.577\nfor law enforcement and others\n\n00:09:56.577 --> 00:09:59.960\nto find out who the real owner is.\n\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.050\nBut whose interests is this all serving?\n\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.176\nIt might be in the interests of the company\n\n00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:07.942\nor a particular individual,\n\n00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:10.330\nbut what about all of us, the public?\n\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.099\nThere hasn't even been a global conversation yet\n\n00:10:13.099 --> 00:10:14.519\nabout whether it's okay\n\n00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:17.754\nto misuse companies in this way.\n\n00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:21.632\nAnd what does it all mean for us?\n\n00:10:21.632 --> 00:10:24.185\nWell, an example that really haunts me\n\n00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:26.563\nis one I came across recently.\n\n00:10:26.563 --> 00:10:28.512\nAnd it's that of a horrific fire\n\n00:10:28.512 --> 00:10:30.297\nin a nightclub in Buenos Aires\n\n00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:33.248\nabout a decade ago.\n\n00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:35.518\nIt was the night before New Year's Eve.\n\n00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:37.686\nThree thousand very happy revelers,\n\n00:10:37.686 --> 00:10:38.723\nmany of them teenagers,\n\n00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:41.918\nwere crammed into a space meant for 1,000.\n\n00:10:41.918 --> 00:10:43.091\nAnd then tragedy struck,\n\n00:10:43.091 --> 00:10:44.694\na fire broke out\n\n00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:46.778\nplastic decorations were melting from the ceiling\n\n00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:48.754\nand toxic smoke filled the club.\n\n00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:50.819\nSo people tried to escape\n\n00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:53.452\nonly to find that some of the fire doors\n\n00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:57.113\nhad been chained shut.\n\n00:10:57.113 --> 00:10:59.546\nOver 200 people died.\n\n00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:03.305\nSeven hundred were injured trying to get out.\n\n00:11:03.305 --> 00:11:06.850\nAnd as the victims' families \nand the city and the country\n\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.394\nreeled in shock,\n\n00:11:08.394 --> 00:11:11.940\ninvestigators tried to find out who was responsible.\n\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.431\nAnd as they looked for the owners of the club,\n\n00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:17.989\nthey found instead anonymous companies,\n\n00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:20.283\nand confusion surrounded the identities of those\n\n00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:22.790\ninvolved with the companies.\n\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.252\nNow ultimately, a range of people were charged\n\n00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:27.279\nand some went to jail.\n\n00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:29.112\nBut this was an awful tragedy,\n\n00:11:29.112 --> 00:11:31.095\nand it shouldn't have been so difficult\n\n00:11:31.095 --> 00:11:35.005\njust to try and find out who was responsible\n\n00:11:35.005 --> 00:11:37.966\nfor those deaths.\n\n00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:39.911\nBecause in an age\n\n00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:42.165\nwhen there is so much information\n\n00:11:42.165 --> 00:11:44.162\nout there in the open,\n\n00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.836\nwhy should this crucial information\n\n00:11:45.836 --> 00:11:47.346\nabout company ownership\n\n00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:49.052\nstay hidden away?\n\n00:11:49.052 --> 00:11:52.777\nWhy should tax evaders, corrupt \ngovernment officials,\n\n00:11:52.777 --> 00:11:55.029\narms traders and more,\n\n00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:59.067\nbe able to hide their identities from us, the public?\n\n00:11:59.067 --> 00:12:04.696\nWhy should this secrecy be such \nan accepted business practice?\n\n00:12:04.696 --> 00:12:06.384\nAnonymous companies\n\n00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:08.593\nmight be the norm right now\n\n00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:10.599\nbut it wasn't always this way.\n\n00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:12.396\nCompanies were created\n\n00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:14.668\nto give people a chance to innovate\n\n00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:18.331\nand not have to put everything on the line.\n\n00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:21.673\nCompanies were created to limit financial risk,\n\n00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:26.623\nthey were never intended to \nbe used as a moral shield.\n\n00:12:26.623 --> 00:12:28.897\nCompanies were never intended to be anonymous,\n\n00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:31.313\nand they don't have to be.\n\n00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:34.203\nAnd so I come to my wish.\n\n00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:37.004\nMy wish is for us to know\n\n00:12:37.004 --> 00:12:39.730\nwho owns and controls companies\n\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.480\nso that they can no longer be used anonymously\n\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.110\nagainst the public good.\n\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.776\nTogether let's ignite world opinion,\n\n00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:49.253\nchange the law,\n\n00:12:49.253 --> 00:12:54.133\nand launch a new era of openness in business.\n\n00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:55.765\nSo what might this look like?\n\n00:12:55.765 --> 00:12:58.334\nWell, imagine if you could go online\n\n00:12:58.334 --> 00:13:01.451\nand look up the real owner of a company.\n\n00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:04.223\nImagine if this data were open and free,\n\n00:13:04.223 --> 00:13:05.934\naccessible across borders\n\n00:13:05.934 --> 00:13:07.733\nfor citizens and businesses\n\n00:13:07.733 --> 00:13:09.421\nand law enforcement alike.\n\n00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:13.889\nImagine what a game changer that would be.\n\n00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:16.392\nSo how are we going to do this?\n\n00:13:16.392 --> 00:13:17.838\nWell, there is only one way.\n\n00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:21.089\nTogether, we have to change the law globally\n\n00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:23.030\nto create public registries\n\n00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.885\nwhich list the true owners of companies\n\n00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:27.921\nand can be accessed by all\n\n00:13:27.921 --> 00:13:30.050\nwith no loopholes.\n\n00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.782\nAnd yes, this is ambitious,\n\n00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:36.173\nbut there is momentum on this issue,\n\n00:13:36.173 --> 00:13:38.217\nand over the years I have seen\n\n00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:40.549\nthe sheer power of momentum,\n\n00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:42.933\nand it's just starting on this issue.\n\n00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:46.211\nThere is such an opportunity right now.\n\n00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:48.240\nAnd the TED community\n\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.605\nof creative and innovative thinkers and doers\n\n00:13:51.605 --> 00:13:53.502\nacross all of society\n\n00:13:53.502 --> 00:13:56.761\ncould make the crucial difference.\n\n00:13:56.761 --> 00:14:00.595\nYou really can make this change happen.\n\n00:14:00.595 --> 00:14:02.397\nNow, a simple starting point\n\n00:14:02.397 --> 00:14:03.863\nis the address behind me\n\n00:14:03.863 --> 00:14:06.222\nfor a Facebook page that you can join now\n\n00:14:06.222 --> 00:14:08.968\nto support the campaign and spread the word.\n\n00:14:08.968 --> 00:14:10.392\nIt's going to be a springboard\n\n00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.353\nfor our global campaigning.\n\n00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:13.828\nAnd the techies among you,\n\n00:14:13.828 --> 00:14:17.201\nyou could really help us create a prototype\n\n00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:18.921\npublic registry\n\n00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:23.797\nto demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.\n\n00:14:23.797 --> 00:14:26.308\nCampaign groups from around the world\n\n00:14:26.308 --> 00:14:31.168\nhave come together to work on this issue.\n\n00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:34.448\nThe U.K. government is already on board;\n\n00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:36.850\nit supports these public registries.\n\n00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.748\nAnd just last week,\n\n00:14:38.748 --> 00:14:41.456\nthe European Parliament came on board\n\n00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:46.522\nwith a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.\n\n00:14:46.522 --> 00:14:48.947\nThat is momentum.\n\n00:14:48.947 --> 00:14:52.775\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:53.943 --> 00:14:56.248\nBut it's early days.\n\n00:14:56.248 --> 00:14:58.740\nAmerica still needs to come on board,\n\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.317\nas do so many other countries.\n\n00:15:02.317 --> 00:15:05.426\nAnd to succeed we will all together\n\n00:15:05.426 --> 00:15:07.870\nneed to help and push our politicians,\n\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.457\nbecause without that,\n\n00:15:09.457 --> 00:15:11.425\nreal far-reaching, world-shifting change\n\n00:15:11.425 --> 00:15:14.126\njust isn't going to happen.\n\n00:15:14.126 --> 00:15:16.815\nBecause this isn't just about changing the law,\n\n00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:18.907\nthis is about starting a conversation\n\n00:15:18.907 --> 00:15:21.300\nabout what it's okay for companies to do,\n\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:26.334\nand in what ways is it acceptable \nto use company structures.\n\n00:15:26.334 --> 00:15:29.107\nThis isn't just a dry policy issue.\n\n00:15:29.107 --> 00:15:30.595\nThis is a human issue\n\n00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:33.253\nwhich affects us all.\n\n00:15:33.253 --> 00:15:39.657\nThis is about being on the right side of history.\n\n00:15:39.657 --> 00:15:45.015\nGlobal citizens, innovators, \nbusiness leaders, individuals,\n\n00:15:45.015 --> 00:15:47.002\nwe need you.\n\n00:15:47.002 --> 00:15:50.512\nTogether, let's kickstart this global movement.\n\n00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:51.857\nLet's just do it,\n\n00:15:51.857 --> 00:15:55.159\nlet's end anonymous companies.\n\n00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:57.263\nThank you.\n\n00:15:57.263 --> 00:16:00.709\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The NSA responds to Edward Snowden's TED Talk", "duration": "2010", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_ledgett_the_nsa_responds_to_edward_snowden_s_ted_talk", "transcript": "Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here a couple days ago, and this is response time. And several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA. So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director of the National Security Agency, and he's a senior civilian officer there, acts as its chief operating officer, guiding strategies, setting internal policies, and serving as the principal advisor to the director. And all being well, welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED. (Applause)Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here. I look forward to the conversation, so thanks for arranging for that.CA: Thank you, Rick. We appreciate you joining us. It's certainly quite a strong statement that the NSA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here. You saw, I think, the talk and interview that Edward Snowden gave here a couple days ago. What did you make of it? RL: So I think it was interesting. We didn't realize that he  was going to show up there, so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. I think that, like a lot of the things that have come out since Mr. Snowden started disclosing classified information, there were some kernels of truth in there, but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there, and I'm interested in helping to address those. I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally, and I think it is important and of import, and so given that, we need to have that be a fact-based conversation, and we want to help make that happen.CA: So the question that a lot  of people have here is, what do you make of Snowden's motivations for doing what he did, and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone?RL: He absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone, and I actually think that characterizing him as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities. So what if somebody who works in the NSA \u2014 and there are over 35,000 people who do. They're all great citizens. They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters, brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives, all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally, and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern. First off, there's their supervisor, and up through the supervisory chain within their organization. If folks aren't comfortable with that, there are a number of inspectors general. In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option of the NSA inspector general, the Navy inspector general, the Pacific Command inspector general, the Department of Defense inspector general, and the intelligence community inspector general, any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them. (CA and RL speaking at once) He had the option to go to congressional committees, and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place, and so he didn't do any of those things.CA: Now, you had said that Ed Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns. The comeback on that is a couple of things: one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor, the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available, two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers, like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated pretty harshly, by some views, and thirdly, what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered, but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government. I mean, in that circumstance, couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable?RL: No, I don't agree with that. I think that the \u2014 sorry, I'm getting feedback through the microphone there \u2014 the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that  he put people's lives at risk, basically, in the long run, and I know there's been a lot of talk in public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk, and that is categorically not true. They actually do. I think there's also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the framers of the Constitution in how the government should  be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive  and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other, and then the judicial branch, which oversees the entire process. I think that's extremely arrogant on his part.CA: Can you give a specific example of how he put people's lives at risk?RL: Yeah, sure. So the things that he's disclosed, the capabilities, and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization, so when we have foreign intelligence targets, legitimate things of interest \u2014 like, terrorists is the iconic example, but it includes things like human traffickers, drug traffickers, people who are trying to build advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons, and build delivery systems for those, and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors, which you may have some visibility into some of that that's going on right now, the capabilities are applied in very discrete and measured and controlled ways. So the unconstrained disclosure  of those capabilities means that as adversaries see them and recognize, \"Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,\" they move away from that, and we have seen targets in terrorism, in the nation-state area, in smugglers of various types, and other folks who have, because of the disclosures, moved away from our ability to have insight into what they're doing. The net effect of that is that our people who are overseas in dangerous places, whether they're diplomats or military, and our allies who are in similar situations, are at greater risk because we don't see the threats that are coming their way.CA: So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations, access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down, has been closed down. But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place. I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of  access that you've spoken of.RL: So there are, when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before, use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology, and they do, because it's a great system, it's the most complex system ever devised by man, and it is a wonder, and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that, and it's just a wonderful thing. But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies. And so if I'm going to pursue them, I need to have the capability to go after them, and again, the controls are in how I apply that capability, not that I have the capability itself. Otherwise, if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet, we could have a domain, badguy.com. That would be awesome, and we could just concentrate all our efforts there. That's not how it works. They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions, and so we have to swim in that same space. But I will tell you this. So NSA has two missions. One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press. The other one is the Information Assurance mission, which is to protect the national security systems of the United States, and by that, that's things like the communications that the president uses, the communications that control our nuclear weapons, the communications that our military uses around the world, and the communications that we use with our allies, and that some of our allies themselves use. And so we make recommendations on standards to use, and we use those same standards, and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes.CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large, any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety. And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion, that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet. They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity, kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example. It's the bringer of knowledge to all. It's the connector of all. And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms. And from that lens, what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read. Can you understand that from that viewpoint, it feels outrageous?RL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet, and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet. It is a global telecommunications system. The Internet is a big chunk of  that, but there is a lot more. And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy. That's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security. I don't think that's the right framing. I think it really is transparency and secrecy. And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having, and we want to participate in that, and want people to participate in it in an informed way. So there are things, let me talk there a little bit more, there are things that we need to be transparent about: our authorities, our processes, our oversight, who we are. We, NSA, have not done a good job of that, and I think that's part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media. Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything. There's takeoffs of our logo of an eagle with headphones on around it. And so that's the public characterization. And so we need to be more transparent about those things. What we don't need to be transparent about, because it's bad for the U.S., it's bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people, it's bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we're all working against, the generally recognized bad guys, to counter those.CA: But isn't it also bad to deal a kind of body blow to the American companies that have essentially given the world most of the Internet services that matter? RL: It is. It's really the companies are in a tough position, as are we, because the companies, we compel them to provide information, just like every other nation in the world does. Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security, and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they're operating in Russia or the U.K. or China or India or France, any country that you choose to name. And so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as \"you can't trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them\" is actually only accurate in the sense that it's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world. And so it's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage, and it's being marketed that  way by several countries, including some of our allied countries, where they are saying, \"Hey, you can't trust the U.S., but you can trust our telecom company, because we're safe.\" And they're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U.S. companies have in areas like the cloud and Internet-based technologies.CA: You're sitting there with the American flag, and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. How do you characterize the American citizen's right to privacy? Is there such a right?RL: Yeah, of course there is. And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure, inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say, amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy. and beyond that, the privacy of citizens around the world, it's not just Americans. Several things come into play here. First, we're all in the same network. My communications, I'm a user of a particular Internet email service that is the number one email service of choice by terrorists around the world, number one. So I'm there right beside them in email space in the Internet. And so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that's relevant. In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business, and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out, that says, when you find that, not if you find it, when you find it, because you're certain to find it, here's how you protect that. These are called minimization procedures. They're approved by the attorney general and constitutionally based. And so we protect those. And then, for people, citizens of the world who are going about their lawful business on a day-to-day basis, the president on his January 17 speech, laid out some additional protections that we are providing to them. So I think absolutely, folks do have a right to privacy, and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected.CA: What about foreigners using American companies' Internet services? Do they have any privacy rights?RL: They do. They do, in the sense of, the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories: We can identify that this particular person, identified by a selector of some kind, is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.CA: Much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you've obtained through these programs is essentially metadata. It's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call. It's who they wrote to and when, and so forth. But it's been argued, and someone here in the audience has talked to a former NSA analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data, because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented. With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn? Is there anything to that?RL: I don't really understand that argument. I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons. Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide. So when a terrorist is corresponding with somebody else who's not known to us but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity, or someone who's violating international sanctions by providing nuclear weapons-related material to a country like Iran or North Korea, is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity. What metadata lets you do is connect that. The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy, which is gigantic amounts of content collection. So metadata, in that sense, actually is privacy-enhancing. And we don't, contrary to some of the stuff that's been printed, we don't sit there and grind out metadata profiles of average people. If you're not connected to one of those valid intelligence targets, you are not of interest to us.CA: So in terms of the threats that face America overall, where would you place terrorism?RL: I think terrorism is still number one. I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance. An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo, used to describe it as arcs of instability. And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now, in places like Syria, where there's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers, thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into Syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity, and lots of those people are Westerners who hold passports to European countries or in some cases the United States, and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries. You've got places like Iraq, which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence, again a breeding ground for terrorism. And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel area of Africa. Again, lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity. So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one. I think number two is cyber threat. I think cyber is a threat in three ways: One way, and probably the most common way that people have heard about it, is due to the theft of intellectual property, so basically, foreign countries going in, stealing companies' secrets, and then providing that information to state-owned enterprises or companies connected to the government to help them leapfrog technology or to gain business intelligence that's then used to win contracts overseas. That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now. Several nation-states are doing it. Second is the denial-of-service attacks. You're probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the U.S. financial sector since 2012. Again, that's a nation-state who is executing those attacks, and they're doing that as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal. And the last one is destructive attacks, and those are the ones that concern me the most. Those are on the rise. You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012, August of 2012. It took down about 35,000 of their computers with a Wiper-style virus. You had a follow-on a week later to a Qatari company. You had March of 2013, you had a South Korean attack that was attributed in the press to North Korea that took out thousands of computers. Those are on the rise, and we see people expressing interest in those capabilities and a desire to employ them.CA: Okay, so a couple of things here, because this is really the core of this, almost. I mean, first of all, a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat. Apart from September 11, I think the numbers are that in the last 30 or 40 years about 500 Americans have died from terrorism, mostly from homegrown terrorists. The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning. I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. Would that be the point of view?RL: Well, I'd say two things. One is, the reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since 9/11, that is not an accident. That's a lot of hard work that we have done, that other folks in the intelligence community have done, that the military has done, and that our allies around the globe have done. You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was 54, 25 of those in Europe, and of those 25, 18 of them occurred in three countries, some of which are our allies, and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs, by the way. So that's not an accident that those things happen. That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another, through law enforcement, through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action. The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat is not at all far-fetched and in fact there are a number of groups who have for several years expressed interest and desire in obtaining those capabilities and work towards that.CA: It's also been said that, of those 54 alleged incidents, that as few as zero of them were actually anything to do with these controversial programs that Mr. Snowden revealed, that it was basically through other forms of intelligence, that you're looking for a needle in a haystack, and the effects of these programs, these controversial programs, is just to add hay to the stack, not to really find the needle. The needle was found by other methods. Isn't there something to that?RL: No, there's actually two programs that are typically implicated in that discussion. One is the section 215 program, the U.S. telephony metadata program, and the other one is popularly called the PRISM program, and it's actually section 702  of the FISA Amendment Act. But the 215 program is only relevant to threats that are directed against the United States, and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated. Now what you'll see people say publicly is there is no \"but for\" case, and so there is no case where, but for that, the threat would have happened. But that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work. You think about on television, you watch a murder mystery. What do you start with? You start with a body, and then they work their way from there to solve the crime. We're actually starting well before that, hopefully before there are any bodies, and we're trying to build the case for who the people are, what they're trying to do, and that involves massive amounts of information. Think of it is as mosaic, and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic was necessary to building the mosaic, but to build the complete picture, you need to have all the pieces of information. On the other, the non-U.S.-related threats out of those 54, the other 42 of them, the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that, and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks.CA: Snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world \"a cover for action,\" that it's something that, because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people, it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn't otherwise have. Is there any internal debate about that?RL: Yeah. I mean, we debate these things all the time, and there is discussion that goes on in the executive branch and within NSA itself and the intelligence community about what's right, what's proportionate, what's the correct thing to do. And it's important to note that the programs that we're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents, two different political parties, by Congress twice, and by federal judges 16 different times, and so this is not NSA running off and doing its own thing. This is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government, and President Madison would have been proud.CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered what was actually being done  with that authorization, many of them were completely shocked. Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction, that it's only because it's now come out publicly, that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you?RL: Congress is a big body. There's 535 of them, and they change out frequently, in the case of the House, every two years, and I think that the NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees, and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress is something that they manage. I think I would say that Congress members had the opportunity to make themselves aware, and in fact a significant number of them, the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility, did have the ability to do that. And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public. CA: Now, you mentioned the  threat of cyberattacks, and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that that is a huge concern, but do you accept that there's a tradeoff between offensive and defensive strategies, and that it's possible that the very measures taken to, \"weaken encryption,\" and allow yourself to find the bad guys, might also open the door to forms of cyberattack?RL: So I think two things. One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't. And the other one is that the NSA has both of those missions, and we are heavily biased towards defense, and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases, we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products. We have a great track record of that, and we're actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them. We want to be more transparent about that. So again, we eat our own dog food. We use the standards, we use the products that we recommend, and so it's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people's need to be.CA: Edward Snowden, when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here in the bot, and I heard him say to a couple of people, they asked him about what he thought of the NSA overall, and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you, said that it's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing, and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies. He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly. He didn't come over like a crazy man. Would you accept that at least, even if you disagree with how he did it, that he has opened a debate that matters?RL: So I think that the discussion is an important one to have. I do not like the way that he did it. I think there were a number of other ways that he could have done that that would have not endangered our people and the people of other nations through losing visibility into what our adversaries are doing. But I do think it's an important conversation.CA: It's been reported that there's almost a difference of opinion with you and your colleagues over any scenario in which he might be offered an amnesty deal. I think your boss, General Keith Alexander, has said that that would be a terrible example for others; you can't negotiate with someone who's broken the law in that way. But you've been quoted as saying that, if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering all undisclosed documents, that a deal maybe should be considered. Do you still think that?RL: Yeah, so actually, this is my favorite thing about that \"60 Minutes\" interview was all the misquotes that came from that. What I actually said, in  response to a question about, would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against Snowden, I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation. This is something that the attorney general of the United States and the president also actually have both talked about this, and I defer to the attorney general, because this is his lane. But there is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to, if it benefits the government, to get something out of that, that there's always room for that kind of discussion. So I'm not presupposing any outcome, but there is always room for discussion.CA: To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S., the government, you, others, in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy, a smarter way forward for the future. Do you see, has that kind of possibility been entertained at all? RL: So that's out of my lane. That's not an NSA thing. That would be a Department of Justice sort of discussion. I'll defer to them.CA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk, I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading. What would be your idea worth spreading for this group?RL: So I think, learn the facts. This is a really important conversation, and it impacts, it's not just NSA, it's not just the government, it's you, it's the Internet companies. The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government, and so learn the facts. Don't rely on headlines, don't rely on sound bites, don't rely on one-sided conversations. So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading. We have a sign, a badge tab, we wear badges at work with lanyards, and if I could make a plug, my badge lanyard at work says, \"Dallas Cowboys.\" Go Dallas. I've just alienated half the audience, I know. So the lanyard that our people who work in the organization that does our crypto-analytic work have a tab that says, \"Look at the data.\" So that's the idea worth spreading. Look at the data.CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage, I think, actually, to come and speak openly to this group. It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past, and plus the technology has been challenging. We truly appreciate you doing that and sharing in this very important conversation. Thank you so much.RL: Thanks, Chris.(Applause)", "id": 1952, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:14.818\nChris Anderson: We had Edward

statement\n\n00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:12.436\nthat the NSA is willing to reach out\n\n00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:16.433\nand show a more open face here.\n\n00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.386\nYou saw, I think,\n\n00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:22.279\nthe talk and interview that Edward Snowden\n\n00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:23.223\ngave here a couple days ago.\n\n00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:25.662\nWhat did you make

--> 00:01:47.428\nthat have come out since Mr. Snowden\n\n00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:49.993\nstarted disclosing classified information,\n\n00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:53.459\nthere were some kernels of truth in there,\n\n00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.953\nbut a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,\n\n00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:59.476\nand I'm interested in helping to address those.\n\n00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:01.796\nI think this is a really important conversation\n\n00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:03.328\nthat we're having in the United States\n\n00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:04.843\nand internationally,\n\n00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:09.252\nand I think it is important and of import,\n\n00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:12.712\nand so given that, we need to have that be\n\n00:02:12.712 --> 00:02:14.112\na fact-based conversation,\n\n00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:16.564\nand we want to help make that happen.\n\n00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:21.181\nCA: So the question that a lot \nof people have here is,\n\n00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:24.095\nwhat do you make of Snowden's motivations\n\n00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:26.346\nfor doing what he did,\n\n00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:30.836\nand did he have an alternative\nway that he could have gone?\n\n00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.175\nRL: He absolutely did\n\n00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:37.373\nhave alternative ways that he could have gone,\n\n00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:42.967\nand I actually think that characterizing him\n\n00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:44.957\nas a whistleblower\n\n00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:48.485\nactually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.\n\n00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:52.056\nSo what if somebody who works in the NSA --\n\n00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:55.060\nand there are over 35,000 people who do.\n\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.413\nThey're all great citizens.\n\n00:02:57.413 --> 00:02:59.716\nThey're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,\n\n00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:03.933\nbrothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,\n\n00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.103\nall of whom are interested in doing the right thing\n\n00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:07.290\nfor their country\n\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.324\nand for our allies internationally,\n\n00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:14.406\nand so there are a variety of venues to address\n\n00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:15.580\nif folks have a concern.\n\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.503\nFirst off, there's their supervisor,\n\n00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:20.195\nand up through the supervisory chain\n\n00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:21.937\nwithin their organization.\n\n00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:23.584\nIf folks aren't comfortable with that,\n\n00:03:23.584 --> 00:03:25.939\nthere are a number of inspectors general.\n\n00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.480\nIn the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option\n\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.405\nof the NSA inspector general,\n\n00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:32.725\nthe Navy inspector general,\n\n00:03:32.725 --> 00:03:34.292\nthe Pacific Command inspector general,\n\n00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:36.202\nthe Department of Defense inspector general,\n\n00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:38.308\nand the intelligence community inspector general,\n\n00:03:38.308 --> 00:03:42.626\nany of whom would have both kept\nhis concerns in classified channels\n\n00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.257\nand been happy to address them.\n\n00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.534\n(CA and RL speaking at once)\n\n00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:50.137\nHe had the option to go to\ncongressional committees,\n\n00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:53.256\nand there are mechanisms\nto do that that are in place,\n\n00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:55.795\nand so he didn't do any of those things.\n\n00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:58.785\nCA: Now, you had said that\n\n00:03:58.785 --> 00:04:01.014\nEd Snowden had other avenues\n\n00:04:01.014 --> 00:04:03.709\nfor raising his concerns.\n\n00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.035\nThe comeback on that is a couple of things:\n\n00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:10.845\none, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,\n\n00:04:10.845 --> 00:04:14.606\nthe avenues that would have been available\nto him as an employee weren't available,\n\n00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:18.037\ntwo, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,\n\n00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:20.648\nlike [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated\n\n00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:23.795\npretty harshly, by some views,\n\n00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:25.448\nand thirdly, what he was taking on\n\n00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:28.785\nwas not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,\n\n00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:30.756\nbut programs that had been approved\n\n00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:33.697\nby all three branches of government.\n\n00:04:33.697 --> 00:04:36.496\nI mean, in that circumstance,\n\n00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.899\ncouldn't you argue that what he did\n\n00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:41.165\nwas reasonable?\n\n00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:43.478\nRL: No, I don't agree with that.\n\n00:04:43.478 --> 00:04:47.215\nI think that the \u2014\n\n00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:49.350\nsorry, I'm getting feedback\n\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.907\nthrough the microphone there \u2014\n\n00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:57.734\nthe actions that he took were inappropriate\n\n00:04:57.734 --> 00:05:02.509\nbecause of the fact that \nhe put people's lives at risk,\n\n00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.981\nbasically, in the long run,\n\n00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:05.545\nand I know there's been a lot of talk\n\n00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:10.209\nin public by Mr. Snowden\nand some of the journalists\n\n00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:13.639\nthat say that the things that have been disclosed\n\n00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.834\nhave not put national security and people at risk,\n\n00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:22.128\nand that is categorically not true.\n\n00:05:22.128 --> 00:05:24.035\nThey actually do.\n\n00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:26.876\nI think there's also an amazing arrogance\n\n00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:31.011\nto the idea that he knows better than\n\n00:05:31.011 --> 00:05:34.306\nthe framers of the Constitution\n\n00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:36.685\nin how the government should \nbe designed and work\n\n00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:38.827\nfor separation of powers\n\n00:05:38.827 --> 00:05:45.274\nand the fact that the executive \nand the legislative branch\n\n00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:47.885\nhave to work together and they have\nchecks and balances on each other,\n\n00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:49.419\nand then the judicial branch,\n\n00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.855\nwhich oversees the entire process.\n\n00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:55.076\nI think that's extremely arrogant on his part.\n\n00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:57.382\nCA: Can you give a specific example\n\n00:05:57.382 --> 00:06:00.838\nof how he put people's lives at risk?\n\n00:06:00.838 --> 00:06:02.835\nRL: Yeah, sure.\n\n00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:06.229\nSo the things that he's disclosed,\n\n00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.744\nthe capabilities,\n\n00:06:07.744 --> 00:06:10.186\nand the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,\n\n00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:14.060\nso when we have foreign intelligence targets,\n\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.691\nlegitimate things of interest --\n\n00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:17.701\nlike, terrorists is the iconic example,\n\n00:06:17.701 --> 00:06:20.795\nbut it includes things like human traffickers,\n\n00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:22.657\ndrug traffickers,\n\n00:06:22.657 --> 00:06:26.621\npeople who are trying to build\nadvanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,\n\n00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:28.584\nand build delivery systems for those,\n\n00:06:28.584 --> 00:06:32.215\nand nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,\n\n00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:34.809\nwhich you may have some visibility\n\n00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:37.563\ninto some of that that's going on right now,\n\n00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:41.525\nthe capabilities are applied\n\n00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:46.526\nin very discrete and measured and controlled ways.\n\n00:06:46.526 --> 00:06:49.314\nSo the unconstrained disclosure \nof those capabilities\n\n00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:51.598\nmeans that as adversaries see them\n\n00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:53.961\nand recognize, \"Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,\"\n\n00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.528\nthey move away from that,\n\n00:06:55.528 --> 00:06:58.737\nand we have seen targets in terrorism,\n\n00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:00.869\nin the nation-state area,\n\n00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.871\nin smugglers of various types, and other folks\n\n00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:05.824\nwho have, because of the disclosures,\n\n00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:08.759\nmoved away from our ability\n\n00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.847\nto have insight into what they're doing.\n\n00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.811\nThe net effect of that is that our people\n\n00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:15.704\nwho are overseas in dangerous places,\n\n00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:17.568\nwhether they're diplomats or military,\n\n00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:20.159\nand our allies who are in similar situations,\n\n00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.018\nare at greater risk because we don't see\n\n00:07:23.018 --> 00:07:25.969\nthe threats that are coming their way.\n\n00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.028\nCA: So that's a general response saying that\n\n00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:30.125\nbecause of his revelations,\n\n00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:32.991\naccess that you had to certain types of information\n\n00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:36.562\nhas been shut down, has been closed down.\n\n00:07:36.562 --> 00:07:40.111\nBut the concern is that the nature of that access\n\n00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:43.815\nwas not necessarily legitimate in the first place.\n\n00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:46.597\nI mean, describe to us this Bullrun program\n\n00:07:46.597 --> 00:07:48.726\nwhere it's alleged that the NSA\n\n00:07:48.726 --> 00:07:51.111\nspecifically weakened security\n\n00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:55.680\nin order to get the type of \naccess that you've spoken of.\n\n00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.821\nRL: So there are, when our\n\n00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:03.533\nlegitimate foreign intelligence targets\nof the type that I described before,\n\n00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:06.569\nuse the global telecommunications system\n\n00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.652\nas their communications methodology,\n\n00:08:08.652 --> 00:08:10.066\nand they do, because it's a great system,\n\n00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:12.904\nit's the most complex system ever devised by man,\n\n00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:14.551\nand it is a wonder,\n\n00:08:14.551 --> 00:08:16.155\nand lots of folks in the room there\n\n00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:18.506\nare responsible for the creation\n\n00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:19.875\nand enhancement of that,\n\n00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:22.748\nand it's just a wonderful thing.\n\n00:08:22.748 --> 00:08:25.245\nBut it's also used by people who are\n\n00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:27.276\nworking against us and our allies.\n\n00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:29.707\nAnd so if I'm going to pursue them,\n\n00:08:29.707 --> 00:08:31.442\nI need to have the capability\n\n00:08:31.442 --> 00:08:33.617\nto go after them,\n\n00:08:33.617 --> 00:08:36.443\nand again, the controls are in\n\n00:08:36.443 --> 00:08:38.964\nhow I apply that capability,\n\n00:08:38.964 --> 00:08:41.210\nnot that I have the capability itself.\n\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.982\nOtherwise, if we could make it so that\n\n00:08:42.982 --> 00:08:45.168\nall the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,\n\n00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:47.124\nwe could have a domain, badguy.com.\n\n00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:48.618\nThat would be awesome,\n\n00:08:48.618 --> 00:08:50.760\nand we could just concentrate all our efforts there.\n\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.092\nThat's not how it works.\n\n00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:54.303\nThey're trying to hide\n\n00:08:54.303 --> 00:08:56.108\nfrom the government's ability\n\n00:08:56.108 --> 00:08:59.391\nto isolate and interdict their actions,\n\n00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:02.203\nand so we have to swim in that same space.\n\n00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:03.805\nBut I will tell you this.\n\n00:09:03.805 --> 00:09:05.284\nSo NSA has two missions.\n\n00:09:05.284 --> 00:09:06.734\nOne is the Signals Intelligence mission\n\n00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:10.361\nthat we've unfortunately read so\nmuch about in the press.\n\n00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:12.099\nThe other one is the Information Assurance mission,\n\n00:09:12.099 --> 00:09:15.010\nwhich is to protect the national security\nsystems of the United States,\n\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.978\nand by that, that's things like\n\n00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:18.994\nthe communications that the president uses,\n\n00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:21.599\nthe communications that\ncontrol our nuclear weapons,\n\n00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:23.868\nthe communications that our\nmilitary uses around the world,\n\n00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:26.359\nand the communications that we use with our allies,\n\n00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:28.083\nand that some of our allies themselves use.\n\n00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:33.920\nAnd so we make recommendations\non standards to use,\n\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.747\nand we use those same standards,\n\n00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:37.625\nand so we are invested\n\n00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.870\nin making sure that those communications\n\n00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.483\nare secure for their intended purposes.\n\n00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.432\nCA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that\n\n00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:49.177\nwhen it comes to the Internet at large,\n\n00:09:49.177 --> 00:09:51.804\nany strategy is fair game\n\n00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:54.720\nif it improves America's safety.\n\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.778\nAnd I think this is partly where there is such\n\n00:09:56.778 --> 00:09:58.163\na divide of opinion,\n\n00:09:58.163 --> 00:09:59.413\nthat there's a lot of people in this room\n\n00:09:59.413 --> 00:10:00.786\nand around the world\n\n00:10:00.786 --> 00:10:02.436\nwho think very differently about the Internet.\n\n00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:05.423\nThey think of it as a momentous\n\n00:10:05.423 --> 00:10:07.021\ninvention of humanity,\n\n00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:10.185\nkind of on a par with the\nGutenberg press, for example.\n\n00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:12.640\nIt's the bringer of knowledge to all.\n\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.344\nIt's the connector of all.\n\n00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:17.729\nAnd it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.\n\n00:10:17.729 --> 00:10:19.302\nAnd from that lens,\n\n00:10:19.302 --> 00:10:21.899\nwhat the NSA has done is equivalent to\n\n00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.059\nthe authorities back in Germany\n\n00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:26.928\ninserting some device into every printing press\n\n00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:30.469\nthat would reveal which books people bought\n\n00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:32.489\nand what they read.\n\n00:10:32.489 --> 00:10:34.720\nCan you understand that from that viewpoint,\n\n00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.925\nit feels outrageous?\n\n00:10:38.925 --> 00:10:42.227\nRL: I do understand that, and I actually share\nthe view of the utility of the Internet,\n\n00:10:42.227 --> 00:10:43.929\nand I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.\n\n00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:46.340\nIt is a global telecommunications system.\n\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.791\nThe Internet is a big chunk of \nthat, but there is a lot more.\n\n00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:52.134\nAnd I think that people have legitimate concerns\n\n00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:58.440\nabout the balance between\ntransparency and secrecy.\n\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.380\nThat's sort of been couched as a balance\n\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.016\nbetween privacy and national security.\n\n00:11:04.016 --> 00:11:05.436\nI don't think that's the right framing.\n\n00:11:05.436 --> 00:11:07.801\nI think it really is transparency and secrecy.\n\n00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:11.360\nAnd so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,\n\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.759\nand we want to participate in that, and want\n\n00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:15.199\npeople to participate in it in an informed way.\n\n00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:17.110\nSo there are things,\n\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.560\nlet me talk there a little bit more,\n\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.329\nthere are things that we need\nto be transparent about:\n\n00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:24.356\nour authorities, our processes,\n\n00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:26.410\nour oversight, who we are.\n\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.176\nWe, NSA, have not done a good job of that,\n\n00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:29.564\nand I think that's part of the reason\n\n00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:32.293\nthat this has been so revelational\n\n00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:34.489\nand so sensational in the media.\n\n00:11:34.489 --> 00:11:38.615\nNobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.\n\n00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.264\nThere's takeoffs of our logo\n\n00:11:41.264 --> 00:11:44.283\nof an eagle with headphones on around it.\n\n00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:47.906\nAnd so that's the public characterization.\n\n00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:52.242\nAnd so we need to be more\ntransparent about those things.\n\n00:11:52.242 --> 00:11:53.660\nWhat we don't need to be transparent about,\n\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.998\nbecause it's bad for the U.S.,\n\n00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:58.581\nit's bad for all those other\ncountries that we work with\n\n00:11:58.581 --> 00:12:00.674\nand that we help provide information\n\n00:12:00.674 --> 00:12:02.396\nthat helps them secure themselves\n\n00:12:02.396 --> 00:12:03.905\nand their people,\n\n00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:07.795\nit's bad to expose operations and capabilities\n\n00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:13.087\nin a way that allows the people\nthat we're all working against,\n\n00:12:13.087 --> 00:12:18.050\nthe generally recognized bad guys,\n\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.350\nto counter those.\n\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.375\nCA: But isn't it also bad to deal\n\n00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:26.779\na kind of body blow to the American companies\n\n00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:28.675\nthat have essentially given the world\n\n00:12:28.675 --> 00:12:33.855\nmost of the Internet services that matter?\n\n00:12:33.855 --> 00:12:37.247\nRL: It is. It's really the companies are\n\n00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:40.635\nin a tough position, as are we,\n\n00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.576\nbecause the companies,\n\n00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:44.908\nwe compel them to provide information,\n\n00:12:44.908 --> 00:12:46.891\njust like every other nation in the world does.\n\n00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.165\nEvery industrialized nation in the

information\n\n00:12:56.174 --> 00:12:57.829\nthat they need for their security,\n\n00:12:57.829 --> 00:13:00.056\nand the companies that are involved\n\n00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:01.484\nhave complied with those programs\n\n00:13:01.484 --> 00:13:03.102\nin the same way that they have to do\n\n00:13:03.102 --> 00:13:06.552\nwhen they're operating in Russia or the U.K.\n\n00:13:06.552 -->

revelations\n\n00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:20.059\nhave been broadly characterized as\n\n00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:21.949\n\"you can't trust company A because\n\n00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:25.464\nyour privacy is

--> 00:13:34.400\nthat deals with any of those countries in the world.\n\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.528\nAnd so it's being picked up by people\n\n00:13:36.528 --> 00:13:38.122\nas a marketing advantage,\n\n00:13:38.122 --> 00:13:39.895\nand it's being marketed that \nway by several countries,\n\n00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:41.406\nincluding some of our allied countries,\n\n00:13:41.406 -->

00:14:18.951\nRL: Yeah, of course there is.\n\n00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:21.994\nAnd we devote an inordinate\namount of time and pressure,\n\n00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:24.278\ninordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,\n\n00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:26.486\namount of time and effort in order to ensure\n\n00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:28.818\nthat we protect that privacy.\n\n00:14:28.818 --> 00:14:31.875\nand beyond that, the privacy of citizens\n\n00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:35.524\naround the world, it's not just Americans.\n\n00:14:35.524 --> 00:14:37.424\nSeveral things come into play here.\n\n00:14:37.424 --> 00:14:39.172\nFirst, we're all in the same network.\n\n00:14:39.172 --> 00:14:40.746\nMy communications,\n\n00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:44.893\nI'm a user of a particular Internet email service\n\n00:14:44.893 --> 00:14:48.864\nthat is the number one email service of choice\n\n00:14:48.864 --> 00:14:50.457\nby terrorists around the world, number one.\n\n00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:53.182\nSo I'm there right beside them in email space\n\n00:14:53.182 --> 00:14:55.071\nin the Internet.\n\n00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:58.663\nAnd so we need to be able to pick that apart\n\n00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:02.518\nand find the information that's relevant.\n\n00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:08.451\nIn doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter\n\n00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:10.519\nAmericans and innocent foreign citizens\n\n00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:12.065\nwho are just going about their business,\n\n00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:14.763\nand so we have procedures in\nplace that shreds that out,\n\n00:15:14.763 --> 00:15:16.978\nthat says, when you find that,\n\n00:15:16.978 --> 00:15:19.245\nnot if you find it, when you find it,\nbecause you're certain to find it,\n\n00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:21.028\nhere's how you protect that.\n\n00:15:21.028 --> 00:15:23.133\nThese are called minimization procedures.\n\n00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:25.161\nThey're approved by the attorney general\n\n00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:26.761\nand constitutionally based.\n\n00:15:26.761 --> 00:15:29.241\nAnd so we protect those.\n\n00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:33.712\nAnd then, for people, citizens of the world\n\n00:15:33.712 --> 00:15:35.591\nwho are going about their lawful business\n\n00:15:35.591 --> 00:15:37.298\non a day-to-day basis,\n\n00:15:37.298 --> 00:15:39.594\nthe president on his January 17 speech,\n\n00:15:39.594 --> 00:15:41.087\nlaid out some additional protections\n\n00:15:41.087 --> 00:15:43.146\nthat we are providing to them.\n\n00:15:43.146 --> 00:15:45.018\nSo I think absolutely,\n\n00:15:45.018 --> 00:15:46.553\nfolks do have a right to privacy,\n\n00:15:46.553 --> 00:15:49.172\nand that we work very hard to make sure\n\n00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:51.978\nthat that right to privacy is protected.\n\n00:15:51.978 --> 00:15:53.714\nCA: What about foreigners using\n\n00:15:53.714 --> 00:15:55.864\nAmerican companies' Internet services?\n\n00:15:55.864 --> 00:15:59.709\nDo they have any privacy rights?\n\n00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.382\nRL: They do. They do, in the sense of,\n\n00:16:02.382 --> 00:16:08.122\nthe only way that we are able to compel\n\n00:16:08.122 --> 00:16:10.448\none of those companies to provide us information\n\n00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:13.910\nis when it falls into one of three categories:\n\n00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.462\nWe can identify that this particular person,\n\n00:16:17.462 --> 00:16:19.852\nidentified by a selector of some kind,\n\n00:16:19.852 --> 00:16:23.208\nis associated with counterterrorist\n\n00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:28.457\nor proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.\n\n00:16:28.457 --> 00:16:30.239\nCA: Much has been made of the fact that\n\n00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.705\na lot of the information that you've obtained\n\n00:16:32.705 --> 00:16:34.981\nthrough these programs is essentially metadata.\n\n00:16:34.981 --> 00:16:37.276\nIt's not necessarily the actual words\n\n00:16:37.276 --> 00:16:38.929\nthat someone has written in an email\n\n00:16:38.929 --> 00:16:40.278\nor given on a phone call.\n\n00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:44.327\nIt's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.\n\n00:16:44.327 --> 00:16:45.863\nBut it's been argued,\n\n00:16:45.863 --> 00:16:47.974\nand someone here in the audience has talked\n\n00:16:47.974 --> 00:16:50.441\nto a former NSA analyst who said\n\n00:16:50.441 --> 00:16:52.828\nmetadata is actually much more invasive\n\n00:16:52.828 --> 00:16:54.231\nthan the core data,\n\n00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:55.364\nbecause in the core data\n\n00:16:55.364 --> 00:16:58.591\nyou present yourself as you want to be presented.\n\n00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:01.297\nWith metadata, who knows what the conclusions are\n\n00:17:01.297 --> 00:17:02.713\nthat are drawn?\n\n00:17:02.713 --> 00:17:04.719\nIs there anything to that?\n\n00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:06.508\nRL: I don't really understand that argument.\n\n00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:09.408\nI think that metadata's important\nfor a couple of reasons.\n\n00:17:09.408 --> 00:17:13.886\nMetadata is the information that lets you\n\n00:17:13.886 --> 00:17:17.277\nfind connections that people are trying to hide.\n\n00:17:17.277 --> 00:17:19.288\nSo when a terrorist is corresponding\n\n00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.133\nwith somebody else who's not known to us\n\n00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:23.741\nbut is engaged in doing or\nsupporting terrorist activity,\n\n00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:26.167\nor someone who's violating international sanctions\n\n00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:29.244\nby providing nuclear weapons-related material\n\n00:17:29.244 --> 00:17:31.570\nto a country like Iran or North Korea,\n\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.147\nis trying to hide that activity\nbecause it's illicit activity.\n\n00:17:35.147 --> 00:17:37.957\nWhat metadata lets you do is connect that.\n\n00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:39.489\nThe alternative to that\n\n00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:41.108\nis one that's much less efficient\n\n00:17:41.108 --> 00:17:42.489\nand much more invasive of privacy,\n\n00:17:42.489 --> 00:17:46.325\nwhich is gigantic amounts of content collection.\n\n00:17:46.325 --> 00:17:47.718\nSo metadata, in that sense,\n\n00:17:47.718 --> 00:17:50.114\nactually is privacy-enhancing.\n\n00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:52.219\nAnd we don't, contrary to some of the stuff\n\n00:17:52.219 --> 00:17:53.934\nthat's been printed,\n\n00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:56.703\nwe don't sit there and grind out\n\n00:17:56.703 --> 00:17:59.540\nmetadata profiles of average people.\n\n00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.496\nIf you're not connected\n\n00:18:01.496 --> 00:18:04.548\nto one of those valid intelligence targets,\n\n00:18:04.548 --> 00:18:07.961\nyou are not of interest to us.\n\n00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:11.133\nCA: So in terms of the threats\n\n00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:13.445\nthat face America overall,\n\n00:18:13.445 --> 00:18:16.657\nwhere would you place terrorism?\n\n00:18:16.657 --> 00:18:19.755\nRL: I think terrorism is still number one.\n\n00:18:19.755 --> 00:18:23.659\nI think that we have never been in a time\n\n00:18:23.659 --> 00:18:25.650\nwhere there are more places\n\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.503\nwhere things are going badly\n\n00:18:28.503 --> 00:18:32.404\nand forming the petri dish in which terrorists\n\n00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:37.714\ntake advantage of the lack of governance.\n\n00:18:37.714 --> 00:18:41.351\nAn old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,\n\n00:18:41.351 --> 00:18:43.564\nused to describe it as arcs of instability.\n\n00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:45.932\nAnd so you have a lot of those arcs of instability\n\n00:18:45.932 --> 00:18:47.625\nin the world right now,\n\n00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.462\nin places like Syria, where there's a civil war\n\n00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.172\ngoing on and you have massive numbers,\n\n00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:53.907\nthousands and thousands of foreign fighters\n\n00:18:53.907 --> 00:18:55.640\nwho are coming into Syria\n\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.143\nto learn how to be terrorists\n\n00:18:57.143 --> 00:18:59.244\nand practice that activity,\n\n00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:01.943\nand lots of those people are Westerners\n\n00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:05.672\nwho hold passports to European countries\n\n00:19:05.672 --> 00:19:07.424\nor in some cases the United States,\n\n00:19:07.424 --> 00:19:09.825\nand so they are basically learning how\n\n00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:13.305\nto do jihad and have expressed intent\n\n00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:15.718\nto go out and do that later on\n\n00:19:15.718 --> 00:19:17.385\nin their home countries.\n\n00:19:17.385 --> 00:19:18.706\nYou've got places like Iraq,\n\n00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:21.488\nwhich is suffering from a high\nlevel of sectarian violence,\n\n00:19:21.488 --> 00:19:24.139\nagain a breeding ground for terrorism.\n\n00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:26.645\nAnd you have the activity in the Horn of Africa\n\n00:19:26.645 --> 00:19:29.692\nand the Sahel area of Africa.\n\n00:19:29.692 --> 00:19:32.220\nAgain, lots of weak governance\n\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.111\nwhich forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.\n\n00:19:36.111 --> 00:19:38.105\nSo I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.\n\n00:19:38.105 --> 00:19:40.359\nI think number two is cyber threat.\n\n00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:46.123\nI think cyber is a threat in three ways:\n\n00:19:46.123 --> 00:19:49.877\nOne way, and probably the most common way\n\n00:19:49.877 --> 00:19:52.069\nthat people have heard about it,\n\n00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:54.069\nis due to the theft of intellectual property,\n\n00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:58.373\nso basically, foreign countries going in,\n\n00:19:58.373 --> 00:20:00.250\nstealing companies' secrets,\n\n00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.248\nand then providing that information\n\n00:20:02.248 --> 00:20:03.985\nto state-owned enterprises\n\n00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:06.934\nor companies connected to the government\n\n00:20:06.934 --> 00:20:09.437\nto help them leapfrog technology\n\n00:20:09.437 --> 00:20:11.512\nor to gain business intelligence\n\n00:20:11.512 --> 00:20:14.180\nthat's then used to win contracts overseas.\n\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.919\nThat is a hugely costly set of\nactivities that's going on right now.\n\n00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:19.386\nSeveral nation-states are doing it.\n\n00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.611\nSecond is the denial-of-service attacks.\n\n00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:23.990\nYou're probably aware that there have been\n\n00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.961\na spate of those directed against\n\n00:20:25.961 --> 00:20:29.549\nthe U.S. financial sector since 2012.\n\n00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:32.166\nAgain, that's a nation-state who\nis executing those attacks,\n\n00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.239\nand they're doing that\n\n00:20:33.239 --> 00:20:37.992\nas a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.\n\n00:20:37.992 --> 00:20:39.382\nAnd the last one is destructive attacks,\n\n00:20:39.382 --> 00:20:40.908\nand those are the ones that concern me the most.\n\n00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.308\nThose are on the rise.\n\n00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:45.938\nYou have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,\n\n00:20:45.938 --> 00:20:47.628\nAugust of 2012.\n\n00:20:47.628 --> 00:20:49.913\nIt took down about 35,000 of their computers\n\n00:20:49.913 --> 00:20:51.705\nwith a Wiper-style virus.\n\n00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:53.618\nYou had a follow-on a week later\n\n00:20:53.618 --> 00:20:55.152\nto a Qatari company.\n\n00:20:55.152 --> 00:20:57.293\nYou had March of 2013,\n\n00:20:57.293 --> 00:20:59.964\nyou had a South Korean attack\n\n00:20:59.964 --> 00:21:02.397\nthat was attributed in the press to North Korea\n\n00:21:02.397 --> 00:21:04.452\nthat took out thousands of computers.\n\n00:21:04.452 --> 00:21:05.897\nThose are on the rise,\n\n00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.631\nand we see people expressing interest\n\n00:21:08.631 --> 00:21:09.807\nin those capabilities\n\n00:21:09.807 --> 00:21:11.824\nand a desire to employ them.\n\n00:21:11.824 --> 00:21:13.390\nCA: Okay, so a couple of things here,\n\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.332\nbecause this is really the core of this, almost.\n\n00:21:15.332 --> 00:21:16.596\nI mean, first of all,\n\n00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:18.154\na lot of people who look at risk\n\n00:21:18.154 --> 00:21:19.371\nand look at the numbers\n\n00:21:19.371 --> 00:21:21.631\ndon't understand this belief that terrorism\n\n00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:23.515\nis still the number one threat.\n\n00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:25.143\nApart from September 11,\n\n00:21:25.143 --> 00:21:27.498\nI think the numbers are that\nin the last 30 or 40 years\n\n00:21:27.498 --> 00:21:30.599\nabout 500 Americans have died from terrorism,\n\n00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:34.582\nmostly from homegrown terrorists.\n\n00:21:34.582 --> 00:21:36.169\nThe chance in the last few years\n\n00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:37.892\nof being killed by terrorism\n\n00:21:37.892 --> 00:21:41.876\nis far less than the chance\nof being killed by lightning.\n\n00:21:41.876 --> 00:21:45.282\nI guess you would say that a single nuclear incident\n\n00:21:45.282 --> 00:21:48.608\nor bioterrorism act or something like that\n\n00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:50.509\nwould change those numbers.\n\n00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:52.671\nWould that be the point of view?\n\n00:21:52.671 --> 00:21:53.847\nRL: Well, I'd say two things.\n\n00:21:53.847 --> 00:21:55.773\nOne is, the reason that there hasn't been\n\n00:21:55.773 --> 00:21:57.583\na major attack in the United States since 9/11,\n\n00:21:57.583 --> 00:21:59.139\nthat is not an accident.\n\n00:21:59.139 --> 00:22:01.325\nThat's a lot of hard work that we have done,\n\n00:22:01.325 --> 00:22:02.706\nthat other folks\n\n00:22:02.706 --> 00:22:04.089\nin the intelligence community have done,\n\n00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:05.270\nthat the military has done,\n\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.318\nand that our allies

00:22:21.582\nand of those 25,\n\n00:22:21.582 --> 00:22:24.187\n18 of them occurred in three countries,\n\n00:22:24.187 --> 00:22:26.050\nsome of which are our allies,\n\n00:22:26.050 -->

are, what they're trying to do,\n\n00:24:42.135 --> 00:24:44.985\nand that involves massive amounts of information.\n\n00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:46.466\nThink of it is as mosaic,\n\n00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:48.628\nand it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic\n\n00:24:48.628 --> 00:24:51.260\nwas necessary to building the mosaic,\n\n00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.989\nbut to build the complete

been\n\n00:25:15.453 --> 00:25:17.581\nwhat is called in the intelligence world\n\n00:25:17.581 --> 00:25:19.127\n\"a cover for action,\"\n\n00:25:19.127 --> 00:25:21.064\nthat it's something

any internal debate about that?\n\n00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:37.245\nRL: Yeah.\n\n00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:39.245\nI mean, we debate these things all the time,\n\n00:25:39.245 --> 00:25:42.004\nand there is discussion that goes on\n\n00:25:42.004 --> 00:25:43.925\nin the executive branch\n\n00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:45.988\nand within NSA itself\n\n00:25:45.988 --> 00:25:47.643\nand the intelligence

important to note that the programs\n\n00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.189\nthat we're talking about\n\n00:25:53.189 --> 00:25:56.591\nwere all authorized by two different presidents,\n\n00:25:56.591 -->

00:26:28.975\nwhat was actually being done \nwith that authorization,\n\n00:26:28.975 --> 00:26:31.844\nmany of them were completely shocked.\n\n00:26:31.844 --> 00:26:35.190\nOr do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,\n\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.295\nthat it's only because it's now come out publicly,\n\n00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:40.397\nthat they really knew exactly what you were doing\n\n00:26:40.397 --> 00:26:42.733\nwith the powers they had granted you?\n\n00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:44.407\nRL: Congress is a big body.\n\n00:26:44.407 --> 00:26:46.384\nThere's 535 of them,\n\n00:26:46.384 --> 00:26:48.525\nand they change out frequently,\n\n00:26:48.525 --> 00:26:50.383\nin the case of the House, every two years,\n\n00:26:50.383 --> 00:26:54.159\nand I think that the NSA provided\n\n00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:57.296\nall the relevant information\nto our oversight committees,\n\n00:26:57.296 --> 00:26:59.574\nand then the dissemination of that

I would say that Congress members\n\n00:27:08.963 --> 00:27:12.794\nhad the opportunity to make themselves aware,\n\n00:27:12.794 --> 00:27:14.663\nand in fact a significant number of

you've actually had the chairs of\nthose committees say that in public.\n\n00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:24.790\nCA: Now, you mentioned the \nthreat of cyberattacks,\n\n00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.957\nand I

tradeoff\n\n00:27:30.681 --> 00:27:33.092\nbetween offensive and defensive strategies,\n\n00:27:33.092 --> 00:27:35.917\nand that it's possible that the very measures taken\n\n00:27:35.917 -->

I didn't.\n\n00:27:51.702 --> 00:27:56.828\nAnd the other one is that\n\n00:27:56.828 --> 00:27:59.604\nthe NSA has both of those missions,\n\n00:27:59.604 --> 00:28:01.885\nand we are heavily biased towards defense,\n\n00:28:01.885 --> 00:28:05.402\nand, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find\n\n00:28:05.402 --> 00:28:07.503\nin the overwhelming majority of cases,\n\n00:28:07.503 --> 00:28:10.276\nwe disclose to the people who are responsible\n\n00:28:10.276 --> 00:28:13.639\nfor manufacturing or developing those products.\n\n00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:15.022\nWe have a great track

00:28:28.929\nWe want to be more transparent about that.\n\n00:28:28.929 --> 00:28:32.058\nSo again, we eat our own dog food.\n\n00:28:32.058 --> 00:28:34.311\nWe use the standards, we use the products\n\n00:28:34.311 --> 00:28:36.966\nthat we recommend,\n\n00:28:36.966 --> 00:28:39.261\nand so it's in our interest\n\n00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:41.899\nto keep our communications

actually said, in \nresponse to a question about,\n\n00:30:39.922 --> 00:30:41.734\nwould you entertain any discussions\n\n00:30:41.734 --> 00:30:48.119\nof mitigating action against Snowden,\n\n00:30:48.119 --> 00:30:49.951\nI said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.\n\n00:30:49.951 --> 00:30:51.586\nThis is something that the attorney general\n\n00:30:51.586 --> 00:30:53.516\nof the United States and the president also\n\n00:30:53.516 --> 00:30:55.054\nactually have both talked about this,\n\n00:30:55.054 --> 00:30:56.423\nand I defer to the attorney general,\n\n00:30:56.423 --> 00:30:57.970\nbecause this is his lane.\n\n00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.479\nBut there is a strong tradition\n\n00:31:00.479 --> 00:31:03.671\nin American jurisprudence\n\n00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:08.246\nof having discussions with people\n\n00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:10.090\nwho have been charged with crimes in order to,\n\n00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.606\nif it benefits the government,\n\n00:31:11.606 --> 00:31:13.984\nto get something out of that,\n\n00:31:13.984 --> 00:31:16.618\nthat there's always room for that kind of discussion.\n\n00:31:16.618 --> 00:31:18.307\nSo I'm not presupposing any outcome,\n\n00:31:18.307 --> 00:31:22.043\nbut there is always room for discussion.\n\n00:31:22.043 --> 00:31:23.643\nCA: To a lay person it seems like\n\n00:31:23.643 --> 00:31:27.011\nhe has certain things to offer the U.S.,\n\n00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:28.750\nthe government, you, others,\n\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.431\nin terms of putting things right\n\n00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:32.489\nand helping figure out a smarter policy,\n\n00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:37.695\na smarter way forward for the future.\n\n00:31:38.946 --> 00:31:41.019\nDo you see, has that kind of possibility\n\n00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:43.417\nbeen entertained at all?\n\n00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:45.055\nRL: So that's out of my lane.\n\n00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:46.584\nThat's not an NSA thing.\n\n00:31:46.584 --> 00:31:48.791\nThat would be a Department of Justice\n\n00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:51.288\nsort of discussion.\n\n00:31:51.288 --> 00:31:54.584\nI'll defer to them.\n\n00:31:54.584 --> 00:31:57.549\nCA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,\n\n00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:01.294\nI offered him the chance to\nshare an idea worth spreading.\n\n00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:02.947\nWhat would be your idea worth spreading\n\n00:32:02.947 --> 00:32:05.229\nfor this group?\n\n00:32:05.229 --> 00:32:07.221\nRL: So I think, learn the facts.\n\n00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:09.837\nThis is a really important conversation,\n\n00:32:09.837 --> 00:32:11.913\nand it impacts, it's not just NSA,\n\n00:32:11.913 --> 00:32:13.111\nit's not just the government,\n\n00:32:13.111 --> 00:32:16.019\nit's you, it's the Internet companies.\n\n00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:19.137\nThe issue of privacy and personal data\n\n00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:20.714\nis much bigger than just the government,\n\n00:32:20.714 --> 00:32:22.625\nand so learn the facts.\n\n00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:24.221\nDon't rely on headlines,\n\n00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:25.897\ndon't rely on sound bites,\n\n00:32:25.897 --> 00:32:28.377\ndon't rely on one-sided conversations.\n\n00:32:28.377 --> 00:32:31.526\nSo that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.\n\n00:32:31.526 --> 00:32:34.919\nWe have a sign, a badge tab,\n\n00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:36.808\nwe wear badges at work with lanyards,\n\n00:32:36.808 --> 00:32:38.221\nand if I could make a plug,\n\n00:32:38.221 --> 00:32:40.968\nmy badge lanyard at work says, \"Dallas Cowboys.\"\n\n00:32:40.968 --> 00:32:44.465\nGo Dallas.\n\n00:32:44.465 --> 00:32:47.131\nI've just alienated half the audience, I know.\n\n00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:51.027\nSo the lanyard that our people\n\n00:32:51.027 --> 00:32:52.812\nwho work in the organization\n\n00:32:52.812 --> 00:32:55.232\nthat does our crypto-analytic work\n\n00:32:55.232 --> 00:32:57.173\nhave a tab that says, \"Look at the data.\"\n\n00:32:57.173 --> 00:32:58.709\nSo that's the idea worth spreading.\n\n00:32:58.709 --> 00:33:00.958\nLook at the data.\n\n00:33:00.958 --> 00:33:03.950\nCA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,\n\n00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.565\nI think, actually, to come and speak openly\n\n00:33:06.565 --> 00:33:07.819\nto this group.\n\n00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:10.486\nIt's not something the NSA\nhas done a lot of in the past,\n\n00:33:10.486 --> 00:33:13.581\nand plus the technology has been challenging.\n\n00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:15.362\nWe truly appreciate you doing that\n\n00:33:15.362 --> 00:33:17.775\nand sharing in this very important conversation.\n\n00:33:17.775 --> 00:33:19.916\nThank you so much.\n\n00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:21.855\nRL: Thanks, Chris.\n\n00:33:21.855 --> 00:33:28.926\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Where\u2019s Google going next?", "duration": "1410", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_page_where_s_google_going_next", "transcript": "Charlie Rose: So Larry sent me an email and he basically said, we've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're a couple of middle-aged boring men. I said, I'm flattered by that \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 because I'm a bit older, and he has a bit more net worth than I do.Larry Page: Well, thank you.CR: So we'll have a conversation about the Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google, and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy, and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question: Where is Google and where is it going? LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot, and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say, is that really what you guys are still doing? And I always kind of think about that myself, and I'm not quite sure. But actually, when I think about search, it's such a deep thing for all of us, to really understand what you want, to understand the world's information, and we're still very much in the early stages of that, which is totally crazy. We've been at it for 15 years already, but it's not at all done.CR: When it's done, how will it be?LP: Well, I guess, in thinking about where we're going \u2014 you know, why is it not done? \u2014 a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know, your computer doesn't know where you are, it doesn't know what you're doing, it doesn't know what you know, and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work, make them understand your context. Google Now, you know, knows where you are, knows what you may need. So really having computing  work and understand you and understand that information, we really haven't done that yet. It's still very, very clunky.CR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing, where does Deep Mind fit?LP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First, let me tell you the way we got there, which was looking at search and really understanding, trying to understand everything, and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you \u2014 like, voice was really important. So what's the state of the art  on speech recognition? It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube? But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats, just by itself. Now, that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are, that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind, what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually \u2014 they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games, and really just, maybe I can show the video, just playing video games, and learning how to do that automatically.CR: Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things.LP: The amazing thing about this is this is, I mean, obviously, these are old games, but the system just sees what you see, the pixels, and it has the controls and it has the score, and it's learned to play all of these games, same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing, and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left, and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule, or your information needs, or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that, and that's what I'm really excited about.CR: When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing, also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we, when you look at that?LP: Well, I think for me, this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company, Demis, has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things.CR: But where's the level of it now? And how fast do you think we are moving?LP: Well, this is the state of the art right now, understanding cats on YouTube and things like that, improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally, but I think for me, this example's really exciting, because it's one program that can do a lot of different things.CR: I don't know if we can do this, but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image?LP: Yeah. CR: There it is. Can you see the cat? Designed by machines, seen by machines.LP: That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training, no notion of a cat, but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand, and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part, it started with search, really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found.(Video) [\"Soy, Kenya\"]Zack Matere: Not long ago, I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much. So, I went and I did a search. [\"Zack Matere, Farmer\"] Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next, he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone, I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information, but there's no follow-up to that. I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge, they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful, but it is how we use it that will define us.(Applause)LP: Now, the amazing thing about that video, actually, was we just read about it in the news, and we found this gentlemen, and made that little clip.CR: When I talk to people about you, they say to me, people who know you well, say, Larry wants to change the world, and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community, and this is an example. LP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me, I have been focusing on access more, if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually, two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost-efficiently.CR: It's a balloon. LP: Yeah, get access to the Internet.CR: And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet? Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible, they didn't have to be tethered.LP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation. Like, we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it, but it was just really, how do we get access points up high, cheaply? You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up, and actually again, it's the power of the Internet, I did a search on it, and I found, 30, 40 years ago, someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought, why can't we do that today? And that's how this project got going.CR: But are you at the mercy of the wind?LP: Yeah, but it turns out, we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before, and if you control the altitude of the balloons, which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways, you can actually control roughly where they go, and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet.CR: Before I talk about the future and transportation, where you've been a nerd for a while, and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles, let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that.LP: Yeah, absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think, for me, I guess, privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things, and I think you can't have privacy without security, so let me just talk about security first, because you asked about Snowden and all of that, and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me, it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from, but we do need to know what the parameters of it is, what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why, and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret.CR: Never coming to Google to ask for anything.LP: Not Google, but the public. I think we need to  have a debate about that, or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense.CR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it.LP: Yes. The privacy side, I think it's \u2014 the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you, and that's an important thing, and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit \u2014 I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice, show them what data's being collected \u2014 search history, location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome, and doing that in more ways, just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at, on your show, actually, I kind of lost my voice, and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back.CR: If I could do anything, I would do that.LP: All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think, you know what, I look at that, I made that public, and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues, and I look at medical records, and I say, wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors? And when someone accesses your medical record, a research doctor, they could see, you could see which doctor accessed it and why, and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that, we'd save 100,000 lives this year.CR: Absolutely. Let me go \u2014 (Applause)LP: So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy, we're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records, is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways.CR: And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused.LP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that, and it was a great thing to do.CR: And the response has been overwhelming.LP: Yeah, and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions, which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing.CR: So talking about the future, what is it about you and transportation systems?LP: Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost, and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems.CR: And that began the idea of an automated car.LP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about people working on automated cars, and I became fascinated by that, and it takes a while to  get these projects going, but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's 20 million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under 34 in the U.S.CR: So you're talking about saving lives.LP: Yeah, and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads, half of the area, and most cities are not far behind, actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for.CR: And how soon will we be there?LP: I think we can be there very, very soon. We've driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly.CR: But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles.LP: Well at Google, we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone, and that's been amazing, most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere, and the bikes wear out. They're getting used 24 hours a day.CR: But you want to put them above the street, too.LP: Well I said, how do we get people using bikes more?CR: We may have a video here.LP: Yeah, let's show the video. I just got excited about this.(Music) So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway, it looks totally crazy, but I was actually thinking about our campus, working with the Zippies and stuff, and just trying to get a lot more bike usage, and I was thinking about, how do you cost-effectively separate the bikes from traffic? And I went and searched, and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this, that particular thing, but it gets your imagination going.CR: Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind. You have this idea of [Google X]. You don't simply want to go in some small, measurable arena of progress.LP: Yeah, I think many of the things we just  talked about are like that, where they're really \u2014 I almost use the economic concept of additionality, which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that, the bigger impact you have, and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed, the more I learn about technology, the more I realize I don't know, and that's because this technological horizon, the thing that you can see to do next, the more you learn about technology, the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them.CR: What's interesting about  you too, though, for me, is that, we have lots of people who are thinking about the future, and they are going and looking and they're coming back, but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about, Tesla. The principle of that for you is what?LP: Well, I think invention is not enough. If you invent something, Tesla invented electric power that we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things, where we have an innovation and invention focus, plus the ability to really \u2014 a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that, because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good.CR: Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well.LP: Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did 50 years ago or 20 years ago. That's not really what we need. We need, especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change.CR: You once said, actually, as I think I've got this about right, that you might consider, rather than giving your money, if you were leaving it to some cause, just simply giving it to Elon Musk, because you had confidence that he would change the future, and that you would therefore \u2014LP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars, he wants to go to Mars, to back up humanity, that's a worthy goal, but it's a company, and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well? I mean, but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies, and I think it's sad, because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is, where a lot of the money is, and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are.CR: When I close conversations with lots of people, I always ask this question: What state of mind, what quality of mind is it that has served you best? People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity, and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind, as I leave this audience, has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present?LP: You know, I think the most important thing \u2014 I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong? What did those companies all do wrong? And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think, for me, I just try to focus on that and say, what is that future really going to be and how do we create it, and how do we cause our organization, to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate? And so that's been curiosity, it's been looking at things people might not think about, working on things that no one else is working on, because that's where the additionality really is, and be willing to do that, to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future, right? That was a good thing to be working on.CR: It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you, and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks, Larry.LP: Thank you.(Applause)CR: Larry Page.", "id": 1953, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.965\nCharlie Rose: So Larry sent me an email\n\n00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:18.952\nand he basically said,\n\n00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:22.681\nwe've got to make sure that \nwe don't seem like we're\n\n00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:27.172\na couple of middle-aged boring men.\n\n00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:30.214\nI said, I'm flattered by that --\n\n00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:32.586\n(Laughter) \u2014\n\n00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:36.101\nbecause I'm a bit

conversation about\n\n00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:48.529\nthe Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google,\n\n00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:49.963\nand we'll have a conversation about search\n\n00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:51.330\nand privacy,\n\n00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.885\nand also about your philosophy\n\n00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.341\nand a sense of how you've connected the dots\n\n00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:57.432\nand how this journey that began\n\n00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.716\nsome time ago\n\n00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.611\nhas such interesting prospects.\n\n00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:03.207\nMainly we want to talk about the future.\n\n00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:04.796\nSo my first question: Where is Google\n\n00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:06.842\nand where is it going?\n\n00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:08.301\nLP: Well, this is something we think about a lot,\n\n00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.876\nand our mission we defined a long time ago\n\n00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:14.139\nis to organize the world's information\n\n00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.577\nand make it universally accessible and useful.\n\n00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.619\nAnd people always say,\n\n00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.834\nis that really what you guys are still doing?\n\n00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.952\nAnd I always kind of think about that myself,\n\n00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:26.148\nand I'm not quite sure.\n\n00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:30.155\nBut actually, when I think about search,\n\n00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.771\nit's such a deep thing for all of us,\n\n00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:35.014\nto really understand what you want,\n\n00:01:35.014 --> 00:01:37.382\nto understand the world's information,\n\n00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:40.914\nand we're still very much in the early stages of that,\n\n00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:42.727\nwhich is totally crazy.\n\n00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:45.245\nWe've been at it for 15 years already,\n\n00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:48.820\nbut it's not at all done.\n\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.496\nCR: When it's done, how will it be?\n\n00:01:51.496 --> 00:01:54.213\nLP: Well, I guess,\n\n00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:56.613\nin thinking about where we're going --\n\n00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:58.900\nyou know, why is it not done? --\n\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.336\na lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess.\n\n00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:03.139\nYou know, your computer\ndoesn't know where you are,\n\n00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.174\nit doesn't know what you're doing,\n\n00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:06.856\nit doesn't know what you know,\n\n00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:09.432\nand a lot we've been trying to do recently\n\n00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:12.727\nis just make your devices work,\n\n00:02:12.727 --> 00:02:15.068\nmake them understand your context.\n\n00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.071\nGoogle Now, you know, knows where you are,\n\n00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:19.253\nknows what you may need.\n\n00:02:19.253 --> 00:02:23.361\nSo really having computing \nwork and understand you\n\n00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.417\nand understand that information,\n\n00:02:25.417 --> 00:02:27.727\nwe really haven't done that yet.\n\n00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:29.276\nIt's still very, very clunky.\n\n00:02:29.276 --> 00:02:31.642\nCR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing,\n\n00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:34.611\nwhere does Deep Mind fit?\n\n00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:36.195\nLP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company\n\n00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:38.726\nwe just acquired recently.\n\n00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:41.808\nIt's in the U.K.\n\n00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:44.462\nFirst, let me tell you the way we got there,\n\n00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:46.690\nwhich was looking at search\n\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.313\nand really understanding,\n\n00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:50.546\ntrying to understand everything,\n\n00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:52.151\nand also make the computers not clunky\n\n00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:54.352\nand really understand you --\n\n00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:56.464\nlike, voice was really important.\n\n00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:59.325\nSo what's the state of the art \non speech recognition?\n\n00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:00.985\nIt's not very good.\n\n00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.051\nIt doesn't really understand you.\n\n00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:05.054\nSo we started doing machine learning research\n\n00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:06.591\nto improve that.\n\n00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:08.294\nThat helped a lot.\n\n00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:10.661\nAnd we started just looking at things like YouTube.\n\n00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:12.629\nCan we understand YouTube?\n\n00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.315\nBut we actually ran machine learning on YouTube\n\n00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:19.400\nand it discovered cats, just by itself.\n\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.491\nNow, that's an important concept.\n\n00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.482\nAnd we realized there's really something here.\n\n00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:26.599\nIf we can learn what cats are,\n\n00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.674\nthat must be really important.\n\n00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:31.303\nSo I think Deep Mind,\n\n00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:33.667\nwhat's really amazing about Deep Mind\n\n00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:35.671\nis that it can actually --\n\n00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:39.228\nthey're learning things in this unsupervised way.\n\n00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:41.795\nThey started with video games,\n\n00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:44.288\nand really just, maybe I can show the video,\n\n00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:46.492\njust playing video games,\n\n00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.507\nand learning how to do that automatically.\n\n00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:50.359\nCR: Take a look at the video games\n\n00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.769\nand how machines are coming to be able\n\n00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.225\nto do some remarkable things.\n\n00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:56.554\nLP: The amazing thing about this\n\n00:03:56.554 --> 00:03:58.234\nis this is, I mean, obviously,\n\n00:03:58.234 --> 00:03:59.708\nthese are old games,\n\n00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:04.506\nbut the system just sees what you see, the pixels,\n\n00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:06.937\nand it has the controls and it has the score,\n\n00:04:06.937 --> 00:04:09.148\nand it's learned to play all of these games,\n\n00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.727\nsame program.\n\n00:04:10.727 --> 00:04:12.764\nIt's learned to play all of these games\n\n00:04:12.764 --> 00:04:14.550\nwith superhuman performance.\n\n00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.405\nWe've not been able to do things like this\n\n00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:17.923\nwith computers before.\n\n00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:20.218\nAnd maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly.\n\n00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:23.023\nThis is boxing, and it figures out it can\n\n00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:25.657\nsort of pin the opponent down.\n\n00:04:25.657 --> 00:04:27.396\nThe computer's on the left,\n\n00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:30.481\nand it's just racking up points.\n\n00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:32.567\nSo imagine if this kind\n\n00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:34.694\nof intelligence were thrown at your schedule,\n\n00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:39.331\nor your information needs, or things like that.\n\n00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:41.949\nWe're really just at the beginning of that,\n\n00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.314\nand that's what I'm really excited about.\n\n00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:46.784\nCR: When you look at all that's taken place\n\n00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:49.368\nwith Deep Mind and the boxing,\n\n00:04:49.368 --> 00:04:51.708\nalso a part of where we're going\n\n00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.597\nis artificial intelligence.\n\n00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:57.396\nWhere are we, when you look at that?\n\n00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.181\nLP: Well, I think for me,\n\n00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:00.684\nthis is kind of one of the most exciting things\n\n00:05:00.684 --> 00:05:02.596\nI've seen in a long time.\n\n00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:05.009\nThe guy who started this company, Demis,\n\n00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.787\nhas a neuroscience and a\ncomputer science background.\n\n00:05:07.787 --> 00:05:09.417\nHe went back to school\n\n00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:12.543\nto get his Ph.D. to study the brain.\n\n00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:15.163\nAnd so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work\n\n00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:18.244\ngoing on that sort of crosses computer science\n\n00:05:18.244 --> 00:05:19.994\nand neuroscience\n\n00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:22.319\nin terms of really understanding\n\n00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.773\nwhat it takes to make something smart\n\n00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:26.488\nand do really interesting things.\n\n00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:28.626\nCR: But where's the level of it now?\n\n00:05:28.626 --> 00:05:31.332\nAnd how fast do you think we are moving?\n\n00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:34.601\nLP: Well, this is the state of the art right now,\n\n00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.732\nunderstanding cats on YouTube\n\n00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:38.015\nand things like that,\n\n00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:40.162\nimproving voice recognition.\n\n00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:42.580\nWe used a lot of machine learning\n\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.059\nto improve things incrementally,\n\n00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.453\nbut I think for me, this example's really exciting,\n\n00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:50.696\nbecause it's one program\n\n00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:52.740\nthat can do a lot of different things.\n\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.878\nCR: I don't know if we can do this,\n\n00:05:53.878 --> 00:05:55.063\nbut we've got the image of the cat.\n\n00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.817\nIt would be wonderful to see this.\n\n00:05:56.817 --> 00:05:59.326\nThis is how machines looked at cats\n\n00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:00.441\nand what they came up with.\n\n00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:01.496\nCan we see that image?\n\n00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:03.898\nLP: Yeah.\nCR: There it is. Can you see the cat?\n\n00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:05.925\nDesigned by machines, seen by machines.\n\n00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:07.035\nLP: That's right.\n\n00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:09.642\nSo this is learned from just watching YouTube.\n\n00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:11.509\nAnd there's no training,\n\n00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:12.893\nno notion of a cat,\n\n00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:15.454\nbut this concept of a cat\n\n00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:18.262\nis something important that you would understand,\n\n00:06:18.262 --> 00:06:20.785\nand now that the machines can kind of understand.\n\n00:06:20.785 --> 00:06:21.957\nMaybe just finishing\n\n00:06:21.957 --> 00:06:24.179\nalso on the search part,\n\n00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:26.965\nit started with search, really understanding\n\n00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:29.529\npeople's context and their information.\n\n00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.389\nI did have a video\n\n00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.399\nI wanted to show quickly on that\n\n00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:35.046\nthat we actually found.\n\n00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:40.158\n(Video) [\"Soy, Kenya\"]\n\n00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:42.410\nZack Matere: Not long ago,\n\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.996\nI planted a crop of potatoes.\n\n00:06:44.996 --> 00:06:48.396\nThen suddenly they started\ndying one after the other.\n\n00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:51.146\nI checked out the books and \nthey didn't tell me much.\n\n00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:53.092\nSo, I went and I did a search.\n\n00:06:53.092 --> 00:06:56.211\n[\"Zack Matere, Farmer\"]\n\n00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:00.714\nPotato diseases.\n\n00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:02.442\nOne of the websites told me\n\n00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:04.344\nthat ants could be the problem.\n\n00:07:04.344 --> 00:07:06.615\nIt said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants.\n\n00:07:06.615 --> 00:07:08.899\nThen after a few days the ants disappeared.\n\n00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.493\nI got excited about the Internet.\n\n00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:13.158\nI have this friend\n\n00:07:13.158 --> 00:07:16.776\nwho really would like to expand his business.\n\n00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:19.971\nSo I went with him to the cyber cafe\n\n00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.512\nand we checked out several sites.\n\n00:07:22.512 --> 00:07:25.053\nWhen I met him next, he was going to put a windmill\n\n00:07:25.053 --> 00:07:27.747\nat the local school.\n\n00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.351\nI felt proud because\n\n00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:31.379\nsomething that wasn't there before\n\n00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:33.266\nwas suddenly there.\n\n00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:35.956\nI realized that not everybody\n\n00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.490\ncan be able to access\n\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.976\nwhat I was able to access.\n\n00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:40.814\nI thought that I need to have an Internet\n\n00:07:40.814 --> 00:07:42.615\nthat my grandmother can use.\n\n00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:45.072\nSo I thought about a notice board.\n\n00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:46.988\nA simple wooden notice board.\n\n00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:49.303\nWhen I get information on my phone,\n\n00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:51.540\nI'm able to post the information\n\n00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.262\non the notice board.\n\n00:07:53.262 --> 00:07:56.120\nSo it's basically like a computer.\n\n00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.009\nI use the Internet to help people.\n\n00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.419\nI think I am searching for\n\n00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:04.960\na better life\n\n00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.074\nfor me and my neighbors.\n\n00:08:09.074 --> 00:08:13.058\nSo many people have access to information,\n\n00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:15.639\nbut there's no follow-up to that.\n\n00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:18.147\nI think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.\n\n00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:19.753\nWhen people have the knowledge,\n\n00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:21.383\nthey can find solutions\n\n00:08:21.383 --> 00:08:23.367\nwithout having to helped out.\n\n00:08:23.398 --> 00:08:25.519\nInformation is powerful,\n\n00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:30.121\nbut it is how we use it that will define us.\n\n00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:34.502\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:34.502 --> 00:08:37.048\nLP: Now, the amazing thing about that video,\n\n00:08:37.048 --> 00:08:38.514\nactually, was we just read about it in the news,\n\n00:08:38.514 --> 00:08:41.019\nand we found this gentlemen,\n\n00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:43.334\nand made that little clip.\n\n00:08:43.334 --> 00:08:44.725\nCR: When I talk to people about you,\n\n00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:47.330\nthey say to me, people who know you well, say,\n\n00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.221\nLarry wants to change the world,\n\n00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:53.333\nand he believes technology can show the way.\n\n00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.191\nAnd that means access to the Internet.\n\n00:08:55.191 --> 00:08:56.922\nIt has to do with languages.\n\n00:08:56.922 --> 00:08:59.751\nIt also means how people can get access\n\n00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:02.457\nand do things that will affect their community,\n\n00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:04.950\nand this is an example.\n\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.526\nLP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me,\n\n00:09:08.526 --> 00:09:10.908\nI have been focusing on access more,\n\n00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:13.106\nif we're talking about the future.\n\n00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:15.780\nWe recently released this Loon Project\n\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.080\nwhich is using balloons to do it.\n\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.740\nIt sounds totally crazy.\n\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.279\nWe can show the video here.\n\n00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.759\nActually, two out of three people in the world\n\n00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:26.145\ndon't have good Internet access now.\n\n00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:29.051\nWe actually think this can really help people\n\n00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:31.108\nsort of cost-efficiently.\n\n00:09:31.108 --> 00:09:34.479\nCR: It's a balloon.\nLP: Yeah, get access to the Internet.\n\n00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:36.622\nCR: And why does this balloon give you access\n\n00:09:36.622 --> 00:09:37.835\nto the Internet?\n\n00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:39.050\nBecause there was some interesting things\n\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.884\nyou had to do to figure out how\n\n00:09:40.884 --> 00:09:43.015\nto make balloons possible,\n\n00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:44.764\nthey didn't have to be tethered.\n\n00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:46.845\nLP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation.\n\n00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:49.389\nLike, we've been thinking about this idea\n\n00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.161\nfor five years or more\n\n00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:52.762\nbefore we started working on it,\n\n00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:54.081\nbut it was just really,\n\n00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:57.601\nhow do we get access points up high, cheaply?\n\n00:09:57.601 --> 00:09:59.393\nYou normally have to use satellites\n\n00:09:59.393 --> 00:10:02.332\nand it takes a long time to launch them.\n\n00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:04.826\nBut you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon\n\n00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.345\nand get it up,\n\n00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:08.346\nand actually again, it's the power of the Internet,\n\n00:10:08.346 --> 00:10:10.126\nI did a search on it,\n\n00:10:10.126 --> 00:10:12.430\nand I found, 30, 40 years ago,\n\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.319\nsomeone had put up a balloon\n\n00:10:14.319 --> 00:10:17.124\nand it had gone around the Earth multiple times.\n\n00:10:17.124 --> 00:10:19.959\nAnd I thought, why can't we do that today?\n\n00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:22.326\nAnd that's how this project got going.\n\n00:10:22.326 --> 00:10:24.656\nCR: But are you at the mercy of the wind?\n\n00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:26.778\nLP: Yeah, but it turns out,\n\n00:10:26.778 --> 00:10:28.271\nwe did some weather simulations\n\n00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:30.818\nwhich probably hadn't really been done before,\n\n00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:32.928\nand if you control the altitude of the balloons,\n\n00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:35.209\nwhich you can do by pumping air into them\n\n00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:37.031\nand other ways,\n\n00:10:37.031 --> 00:10:39.960\nyou can actually control roughly where they go,\n\n00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.165\nand so I think we can build a worldwide mesh\n\n00:10:42.165 --> 00:10:45.504\nof these balloons that can cover the whole planet.\n\n00:10:45.504 --> 00:10:47.746\nCR: Before I talk about the future and transportation,\n\n00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:49.641\nwhere you've been a nerd for a while,\n\n00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:52.065\nand this fascination you have with transportation\n\n00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:54.128\nand automated cars and bicycles,\n\n00:10:54.128 --> 00:10:55.865\nlet me talk a bit about what's been the subject here\n\n00:10:55.865 --> 00:10:58.308\nearlier with Edward Snowden.\n\n00:10:58.308 --> 00:11:01.414\nIt is security and privacy.\n\n00:11:01.414 --> 00:11:03.754\nYou have to have been thinking about that.\n\n00:11:03.754 --> 00:11:05.108\nLP: Yeah, absolutely.\n\n00:11:05.108 --> 00:11:07.951\nI saw the picture of Sergey with\nEdward Snowden yesterday.\n\n00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:10.821\nSome of you may have seen it.\n\n00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:13.992\nBut I think, for me, I guess,\n\n00:11:13.992 --> 00:11:17.654\nprivacy and security are a really important thing.\n\n00:11:17.654 --> 00:11:19.899\nWe think about it in terms of both things,\n\n00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:22.802\nand I think you can't have privacy without security,\n\n00:11:22.802 --> 00:11:25.173\nso let me just talk about security first,\n\n00:11:25.173 --> 00:11:27.769\nbecause you asked about Snowden and all of that,\n\n00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:30.210\nand then I'll say a little bit about privacy.\n\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.010\nI think for me, it's tremendously disappointing\n\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.449\nthat the government\n\n00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:37.779\nsecretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us.\n\n00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:41.082\nI don't think we can have a democracy\n\n00:11:41.082 --> 00:11:44.512\nif we're having to protect you and our users\n\n00:11:44.512 --> 00:11:46.208\nfrom the government\n\n00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:49.011\nfor stuff that we've never had a conversation about.\n\n00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:50.907\nAnd I don't mean we have to know\n\n00:11:50.907 --> 00:11:52.602\nwhat the particular terrorist attack is they're worried\n\n00:11:52.602 --> 00:11:54.364\nabout protecting us from,\n\n00:11:54.364 --> 00:11:56.162\nbut we do need to know\n\n00:11:56.162 --> 00:11:58.572\nwhat the parameters of it is,\n\n00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:00.616\nwhat kind of surveillance the government's\n\n00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.784\ngoing to do and how and why,\n\n00:12:02.784 --> 00:12:05.061\nand I think we haven't had that conversation.\n\n00:12:05.061 --> 00:12:07.628\nSo I think the government's actually done\n\n00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:09.796\nitself a tremendous disservice\n\n00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.957\nby doing all that in secret.\n\n00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:13.572\nCR: Never coming to Google\n\n00:12:13.572 --> 00:12:15.097\nto ask for anything.\n\n00:12:15.097 --> 00:12:17.127\nLP: Not Google, but the public.\n\n00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:20.900\nI think we need to \nhave a debate about that,\n\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.399\nor we can't have a functioning democracy.\n\n00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.805\nIt's just not possible.\n\n00:12:24.805 --> 00:12:27.049\nSo I'm sad that Google's\n\n00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:29.665\nin the position of protecting you and our users\n\n00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.199\nfrom the government\n\n00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:33.443\ndoing secret thing that nobody knows about.\n\n00:12:33.443 --> 00:12:35.190\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.180\nCR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it.\n\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.607\nLP: Yes. The privacy side,\n\n00:12:40.607 --> 00:12:42.576\nI think it's -- the world is changing.\n\n00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:46.481\nYou carry a phone. It knows where you are.\n\n00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:49.566\nThere's so much more information about you,\n\n00:12:49.566 --> 00:12:52.412\nand that's an important thing,\n\n00:12:52.412 --> 00:12:54.684\nand it makes sense why people are asking\n\n00:12:54.684 --> 00:12:56.720\ndifficult questions.\n\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.087\nWe spend a lot of time thinking about this\n\n00:13:00.087 --> 00:13:02.798\nand what the issues are.\n\n00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:04.527\nI'm a little bit --\n\n00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:05.787\nI think the main thing that we need to do\n\n00:13:05.787 --> 00:13:08.149\nis just provide people choice,\n\n00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:10.661\nshow them what data's being collected --\n\n00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:15.412\nsearch history, location data.\n\n00:13:15.412 --> 00:13:18.184\nWe're excited about incognito mode in Chrome,\n\n00:13:18.184 --> 00:13:20.433\nand doing that in more ways,\n\n00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:21.829\njust giving people more choice\n\n00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:25.122\nand more awareness of what's going on.\n\n00:13:25.122 --> 00:13:27.515\nI also think it's very easy.\n\n00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.792\nWhat I'm worried is that we throw out\n\n00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:30.882\nthe baby with the bathwater.\n\n00:13:30.882 --> 00:13:33.796\nAnd I look at, on your show, actually,\n\n00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:35.515\nI kind of lost my voice,\n\n00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:36.846\nand I haven't gotten it back.\n\n00:13:36.846 --> 00:13:38.490\nI'm hoping that by talking to you\n\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.143\nI'm going to get it back.\n\n00:13:40.143 --> 00:13:41.875\nCR: If I could do anything, I would do that.\n\n00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:44.055\nLP: All right. So get out your voodoo doll\n\n00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:46.474\nand whatever you need to do.\n\n00:13:46.474 --> 00:13:48.802\nBut I think, you know what, I look at that,\n\n00:13:48.802 --> 00:13:50.632\nI made that public,\n\n00:13:50.632 --> 00:13:51.849\nand I got all this information.\n\n00:13:51.849 --> 00:13:54.578\nWe got a survey done on medical conditions\n\n00:13:54.578 --> 00:13:57.949\nwith people who have similar issues,\n\n00:13:57.949 --> 00:14:02.690\nand I look at medical records, and I say,\n\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.095\nwouldn't it be amazing\n\n00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:06.145\nif everyone's medical records were available\n\n00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:07.828\nanonymously\n\n00:14:07.828 --> 00:14:10.464\nto research doctors?\n\n00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:13.505\nAnd when someone accesses your medical record,\n\n00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:15.114\na research doctor,\n\n00:14:15.114 --> 00:14:17.748\nthey could see, you could see which doctor\n\n00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:19.608\naccessed it and why,\n\n00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:21.188\nand you could maybe learn about\n\n00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:22.818\nwhat conditions you have.\n\n00:14:22.818 --> 00:14:24.320\nI think if we just did that,\n\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.485\nwe'd save 100,000 lives this year.\n\n00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:29.433\nCR: Absolutely. Let me go \u2014 (Applause)\n\n00:14:29.433 --> 00:14:32.195\nLP: So I guess I'm just very worried that\n\n00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:34.001\nwith Internet privacy,\n\n00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:36.301\nwe're doing the same thing we're \ndoing with medical records,\n\n00:14:36.305 --> 00:14:38.834\nis we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater,\n\n00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:40.662\nand we're not really thinking\n\n00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:42.872\nabout the tremendous good that can come\n\n00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:45.063\nfrom people sharing information\n\n00:14:45.063 --> 00:14:47.640\nwith the right people in the right ways.\n\n00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.877\nCR: And the necessary condition\n\n00:14:49.877 --> 00:14:51.579\nthat people have to have confidence\n\n00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:54.034\nthat their information will not be abused.\n\n00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:55.811\nLP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff.\n\n00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.319\nI was scared to share it.\n\n00:14:57.319 --> 00:14:59.209\nSergey encouraged me to do that,\n\n00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:01.036\nand it was a great thing to do.\n\n00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:02.770\nCR: And the response has been overwhelming.\n\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.430\nLP: Yeah, and people are super positive.\n\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.263\nWe got thousands and thousands of people\n\n00:15:07.263 --> 00:15:08.551\nwith similar conditions,\n\n00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:11.579\nwhich there's no data on today.\n\n00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:12.935\nSo it was a really good thing.\n\n00:15:12.935 --> 00:15:15.954\nCR: So talking about the future, what is it about you\n\n00:15:15.954 --> 00:15:19.712\nand transportation systems?\n\n00:15:19.712 --> 00:15:21.889\nLP: Yeah.

00:15:38.779\nand I just became a bit obsessed\nwith transportation systems.\n\n00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:41.149\nCR: And that began the idea of an automated car.\n\n00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.843\nLP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about\n\n00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:46.025\npeople working on automated cars,\n\n00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:47.648\nand I became fascinated by that,\n\n00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:50.425\nand it takes a while to \nget these projects going,\n\n00:15:50.425 --> 00:15:55.522\nbut I'm super excited about the possibilities of that\n\n00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:57.190\nimproving the world.\n\n00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.716\nThere's 20 million people or more injured per year.\n\n00:16:01.716 --> 00:16:03.702\nIt's the leading cause of death\n\n00:16:03.702 --> 00:16:05.832\nfor people under 34 in the U.S.\n\n00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.383\nCR: So you're talking about saving lives.\n\n00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.738\nLP: Yeah, and also saving space\n\n00:16:09.738 --> 00:16:13.653\nand making life better.\n\n00:16:13.653 --> 00:16:17.898\nLos Angeles is half parking lots and roads,\n\n00:16:17.898 --> 00:16:19.631\nhalf of the area,\n\n00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:22.458\nand most cities are not far behind, actually.\n\n00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:24.022\nIt's just crazy\n\n00:16:24.022 --> 00:16:25.615\nthat that's what we use our space for.\n\n00:16:25.615 --> 00:16:27.958\nCR: And how soon will we be there?\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.884\nLP: I think we can be there very, very soon.\n\n00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:33.385\nWe've driven well over 100,000 miles\n\n00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:37.478\nnow totally automated.\n\n00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:41.130\nI'm super excited about getting that out quickly.\n\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.535\nCR: But it's not only you're\ntalking about automated cars.\n\n00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:45.921\nYou also have this idea for bicycles.\n\n00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:48.167\nLP: Well at Google, we got this idea\n\n00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:51.618\nthat we should just provide free bikes to everyone,\n\n00:16:51.618 --> 00:16:54.386\nand that's been amazing, most of the trips.\n\n00:16:54.386 --> 00:16:55.972\nYou see bikes going everywhere,\n\n00:16:55.972 --> 00:16:57.538\nand the bikes wear out.\n\n00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:58.992\nThey're getting used 24 hours a day.\n\n00:16:58.992 --> 00:17:01.152\nCR: But you want to put them above the street, too.\n\n00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:02.727\nLP: Well I said, how do we get people\n\n00:17:02.727 --> 00:17:04.254\nusing bikes more?\n\n00:17:04.254 --> 00:17:05.879\nCR: We may have a video here.\n\n00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:07.157\nLP: Yeah, let's show the video.\n\n00:17:07.157 --> 00:17:10.249\nI just got excited about this.\n\n00:17:10.249 --> 00:17:14.291\n(Music)\n\n00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:18.596\nSo this is actually how you might separate\n\n00:17:18.596 --> 00:17:22.225\nbikes from cars with minimal cost.\n\n00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:28.424\nAnyway, it looks totally crazy,\n\n00:17:28.424 --> 00:17:30.751\nbut I was actually thinking about our campus,\n\n00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:32.811\nworking with the Zippies and stuff,\n\n00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:35.109\nand just trying to get a lot more bike usage,\n\n00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:36.657\nand I was thinking about,\n\n00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:39.488\nhow do you cost-effectively separate\n\n00:17:39.488 --> 00:17:40.902\nthe bikes from traffic?\n\n00:17:40.902 --> 00:17:42.052\nAnd I went and searched,\n\n00:17:42.052 --> 00:17:43.423\nand this is what I found.\n\n00:17:43.423 --> 00:17:45.268\nAnd we're not actually working on this,\n\n00:17:45.268 --> 00:17:46.560\nthat particular thing,\n\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.614\nbut it gets your imagination going.\n\n00:17:48.614 --> 00:17:50.378\nCR: Let me close with this.\n\n00:17:50.378 --> 00:17:52.723\nGive me a sense of the philosophy \nof your own mind.\n\n00:17:52.723 --> 00:17:55.211\nYou have this idea of [Google X].\n\n00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:58.207\nYou don't simply want\n\n00:17:58.207 --> 00:18:03.803\nto go in some small, measurable arena of progress.\n\n00:18:03.803 --> 00:18:05.516\nLP: Yeah, I think\n\n00:18:05.516 --> 00:18:07.647\nmany of the things we just \ntalked about are like that,\n\n00:18:07.647 --> 00:18:10.599\nwhere they're really --\n\n00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:14.229\nI almost use the economic concept of additionality,\n\n00:18:14.229 --> 00:18:16.419\nwhich means that you're doing something\n\n00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:19.367\nthat wouldn't happen unless \nyou were actually doing it.\n\n00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:22.507\nAnd I think the more you can do things like that,\n\n00:18:22.507 --> 00:18:24.578\nthe bigger impact you have,\n\n00:18:24.578 --> 00:18:27.568\nand that's about doing things\n\n00:18:27.568 --> 00:18:31.175\nthat people might not think are possible.\n\n00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:33.004\nAnd I've been amazed,\n\n00:18:33.004 --> 00:18:35.233\nthe more I learn about technology,\n\n00:18:35.233 --> 00:18:37.429\nthe more I realize I don't know,\n\n00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:40.766\nand that's because this technological horizon,\n\n00:18:40.766 --> 00:18:43.663\nthe thing that you can see to do next,\n\n00:18:43.663 --> 00:18:45.503\nthe more you learn about technology,\n\n00:18:45.503 --> 00:18:48.105\nthe more you learn what's possible.\n\n00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:50.351\nYou learn that the balloons are possible\n\n00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:52.688\nbecause there's some material\nthat will work for them.\n\n00:18:52.688 --> 00:18:55.067\nCR: What's interesting about \nyou too, though, for me,\n\n00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:56.778\nis that, we have lots of people\n\n00:18:56.778 --> 00:18:58.920\nwho are thinking about the future,\n\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.188\nand they are going and looking\nand they're coming back,\n\n00:19:02.188 --> 00:19:04.315\nbut we never see the implementation.\n\n00:19:04.315 --> 00:19:05.920\nI think of somebody you knew\n\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.827\nand read about, Tesla.\n\n00:19:08.827 --> 00:19:12.631\nThe principle of that for you is what?\n\n00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:14.416\nLP: Well, I think invention is not enough.\n\n00:19:14.416 --> 00:19:15.637\nIf you invent something,\n\n00:19:15.637 --> 00:19:18.832\nTesla invented electric power that we use,\n\n00:19:18.832 --> 00:19:21.493\nbut he struggled to get it out to people.\n\n00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.177\nThat had to be done by other people.\n\n00:19:23.177 --> 00:19:24.803\nIt took a long time.\n\n00:19:24.803 --> 00:19:28.670\nAnd I think if we can actually combine both things,\n\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.201\nwhere we have an innovation and invention focus,\n\n00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:35.173\nplus the ability to really -- a company\n\n00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.171\nthat can really commercialize things\n\n00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:38.801\nand get them to people\n\n00:19:38.801 --> 00:19:40.876\nin a way that's positive for the world\n\n00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:42.932\nand to give people hope.\n\n00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.706\nYou know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project\n\n00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:48.492\njust how excited people were about that,\n\n00:19:48.492 --> 00:19:50.306\nbecause it gave them hope\n\n00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:51.927\nfor the two thirds of the world\n\n00:19:51.927 --> 00:19:54.653\nthat doesn't have Internet right now that's any good.\n\n00:19:54.653 --> 00:19:56.775\nCR: Which is a second thing about corporations.\n\n00:19:56.775 --> 00:19:59.251\nYou are one of those people who believe\n\n00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:01.568\nthat corporations are an agent of change\n\n00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:03.039\nif they are run well.\n\n00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.860\nLP: Yeah. I'm really dismayed\n\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.154\nmost people think companies are basically evil.\n\n00:20:08.154 --> 00:20:09.920\nThey get a bad rap.\n\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.161\nAnd I think that's somewhat correct.\n\n00:20:12.161 --> 00:20:15.031\nCompanies are doing the same incremental thing\n\n00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:16.794\nthat they did 50 years ago\n\n00:20:16.794 --> 00:20:18.425\nor 20 years ago.\n\n00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:19.795\nThat's not really what we need.\n\n00:20:19.795 --> 00:20:22.013\nWe need, especially in technology,\n\n00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.130\nwe need revolutionary change,\n\n00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.543\nnot incremental change.\n\n00:20:25.543 --> 00:20:26.712\nCR: You once said, actually,\n\n00:20:26.712 --> 00:20:28.530\nas I think I've got this about right,\n\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.175\nthat you might consider,\n\n00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:31.928\nrather than giving your money,\n\n00:20:31.928 --> 00:20:35.248\nif you were leaving it to some cause,\n\n00:20:35.248 --> 00:20:37.254\njust simply giving it to Elon Musk,\n\n00:20:37.254 --> 00:20:38.417\nbecause you had confidence\n\n00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:40.259\nthat he would change the future,\n\n00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:42.036\nand that you would therefore \u2014\n\n00:20:42.036 --> 00:20:43.620\nLP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars,\n\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.341\nhe wants to go to Mars,\n\n00:20:45.341 --> 00:20:47.312\nto back up humanity,\n\n00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:48.984\nthat's a worthy goal, but it's a company,\n\n00:20:48.984 --> 00:20:51.539\nand it's philanthropical.\n\n00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:54.491\nSo I think we aim to do kind of similar things.\n\n00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:57.478\nAnd I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees\n\n00:20:57.478 --> 00:21:00.793\nat Google who have become pretty wealthy.\n\n00:21:00.793 --> 00:21:03.313\nPeople make a lot of money in technology.\n\n00:21:03.313 --> 00:21:05.469\nA lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy.\n\n00:21:05.469 --> 00:21:07.783\nYou're working because you\nwant to change the world.\n\n00:21:07.783 --> 00:21:09.545\nYou want to make it better.\n\n00:21:09.545 --> 00:21:12.990\nWhy isn't the company that you work for\n\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.933\nworthy not just of your time\n\n00:21:14.933 --> 00:21:17.084\nbut your money as well?\n\n00:21:17.084 --> 00:21:18.806\nI mean, but we don't have a concept of that.\n\n00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:21.110\nThat's not how we think about companies,\n\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.577\nand I think it's sad,\n\n00:21:22.577 --> 00:21:26.344\nbecause companies are most of our effort.\n\n00:21:26.344 --> 00:21:28.859\nThey're where most of people's time is,\n\n00:21:28.859 --> 00:21:30.713\nwhere a lot of the money is,\n\n00:21:30.713 --> 00:21:33.065\nand so I think I'd like for us to help out\n\n00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:34.191\nmore than we are.\n\n00:21:34.191 --> 00:21:35.912\nCR: When I close conversations with lots of people,\n\n00:21:35.912 --> 00:21:37.691\nI always ask this question:\n\n00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:39.206\nWhat state of mind,\n\n00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:41.015\nwhat quality of mind is it\n\n00:21:41.015 --> 00:21:42.782\nthat has served you best?\n\n00:21:42.782 --> 00:21:45.303\nPeople like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity,\n\n00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:47.931\nand other people in the media have said that.\n\n00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:50.955\nBill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus.\n\n00:21:50.955 --> 00:21:52.382\nWhat quality of mind,\n\n00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:53.756\nas I leave this audience,\n\n00:21:53.756 --> 00:21:57.286\nhas enabled you to think about the future\n\n00:21:57.286 --> 00:21:58.933\nand at the same time\n\n00:21:58.933 --> 00:22:01.138\nchange the present?\n\n00:22:01.138 --> 00:22:02.808\nLP: You know, I think the most important thing --\n\n00:22:02.808 --> 00:22:04.420\nI looked at lots of companies\n\n00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.723\nand why I thought they don't succeed over time.\n\n00:22:07.723 --> 00:22:10.556\nWe've had a more rapid turnover of companies.\n\n00:22:10.556 --> 00:22:13.325\nAnd I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong?\n\n00:22:13.325 --> 00:22:15.492\nWhat did those companies all do wrong?\n\n00:22:15.492 --> 00:22:18.764\nAnd usually it's just that they missed the future.\n\n00:22:18.764 --> 00:22:21.208\nAnd so I think, for me,\n\n00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:23.632\nI just try to focus on that and say,\n\n00:22:23.632 --> 00:22:25.816\nwhat is that future really going to be\n\n00:22:25.816 --> 00:22:27.603\nand how do we create it,\n\n00:22:27.603 --> 00:22:32.270\nand how do we cause our organization,\n\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.710\nto really focus on that\n\n00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.035\nand drive that at a really high rate?\n\n00:22:38.035 --> 00:22:39.395\nAnd so that's been curiosity,\n\n00:22:39.395 --> 00:22:41.128\nit's been looking at things\n\n00:22:41.128 --> 00:22:42.846\npeople might not think about,\n\n00:22:42.846 --> 00:22:45.951\nworking on things that no one else is working on,\n\n00:22:45.951 --> 00:22:49.257\nbecause that's where the additionality really is,\n\n00:22:49.257 --> 00:22:50.808\nand be willing to do that,\n\n00:22:50.808 --> 00:22:52.190\nto take that risk.\n\n00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.255\nLook at Android.\n\n00:22:53.255 --> 00:22:56.040\nI felt guilty about working on Android\n\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.356\nwhen it was starting.\n\n00:22:57.356 --> 00:22:59.314\nIt was a little startup we bought.\n\n00:22:59.314 --> 00:23:01.984\nIt wasn't really what we were really working on.\n\n00:23:01.984 --> 00:23:04.479\nAnd I felt guilty about spending time on that.\n\n00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:05.933\nThat was stupid.\n\n00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:06.984\nThat was the future, right?\n\n00:23:06.984 --> 00:23:09.269\nThat was a good thing to be working on.\n\n00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:10.686\nCR: It is great to see you here.\n\n00:23:10.686 --> 00:23:12.146\nIt's great to hear from you,\n\n00:23:12.146

Before that, she was my daughter, but now I am her father. Ladies and gentlemen, if we glance to human history, the story of women is the story of injustice, inequality, violence and exploitation. You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the very beginning, when a girl is born, her birth is not celebrated. She is not welcomed, neither by father nor by mother. The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother, and nobody congratulates the father. And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child. When she gives birth to the first girl child, first daughter, she is sad. When she gives birth to the second daughter, she is shocked, and in the expectation of a son, when she gives birth to a third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.Not only the mother suffers, but the daughter, the newly born daughter, when she grows old, she suffers too. At the age of five, while she should be going to school, she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school. Until the age of 12, somehow, she has a good life. She can have fun. She can play with her friends in the streets, and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly. But when she enters her teens, when she becomes 13 years old, she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort. She is confined under the four walls of her home. She is no more a free individual. She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family, and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor, she could even be killed.And it is also interesting that this so-called code of honor, it does not only affect the life of a girl, it also affects the life of the male members of the family. I know a family of seven sisters and one brother, and that one brother, he has migrated to the Gulf countries, to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents, because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood. So this brother, he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called honor.And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience. A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very submissive. It is the criteria. The role model good girl should be very quiet. She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders, even if she does not like them. If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man, she has to accept, because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient. If she is married very early, she has to accept. Otherwise, she will be called disobedient. And what happens at the end? In the words of a poetess, she is wedded, bedded, and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters. And it is the irony of the situation that this mother, she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons. And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.Ladies and gentlemen, this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently, if women and men think differently, if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries, if they can break a few norms of family and society, if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states, which go against the basic human rights of the women.Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborn children, to be honest, but when I went and I looked into her eyes, believe me, I got extremely honored. And long before she was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan. Her name was Malalai of Maiwand, and I named my daughter after her. A few days after Malala was born, my daughter was born, my cousin came \u2014 and it was a coincidence \u2014 he came to my home and he brought a family tree, a family tree of the Yousafzai family, and when I looked at the family tree, it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors. But when I looked, all were men, and I picked my pen, drew a line from my name, and wrote, \"Malala.\"And when she grow old, when she was four and a half years old, I admitted her in my school. You will be asking, then, why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school? Yes, I must mention it. It may be taken for granted in Canada, in America, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of girl. Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name. Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life. I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you will be astonished, two weeks before, when I was filling out the Canadian visa form, and I was filling out the family part of the form, I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters. And the reason was that I have never, never seen the names of my sisters written on any document. That was the reason that I valued my daughter. What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters, I thought I must change it.I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter. I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come. I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings. And all these good values, I tried to inculcate in her personality. And this was not only she, only Malala. I imparted all these good values to my school, girl students  and boy students as well. I used education for emancipation. I taught my girls, I taught my girl students, to unlearn the lesson of obedience. I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.Dear brothers and sisters, we were striving for more rights for women, and we were struggling to have more, more and more space for the women in society. But we came across a new phenomenon. It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights. It was called Talibanization. It means a complete negation of women's participation in all political, economical and social activities. Hundreds of schools were lost. Girls were prohibited from going to school. Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets. Musicians were silenced, girls were flogged and singers were killed. Millions were suffering, but few spoke, and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog, and you speak for your rights. It's really the most scary thing.At the age of 10, Malala stood, and she stood for the right of education. She wrote a diary for the BBC blog, she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries, and she spoke from every platform she could. And her voice was the most powerful voice. It spread like a crescendo all around the world. And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign, and on October 9 2012, she was shot in the head at point blank range.It was a doomsday for my family and for me. The world turned into a big black hole. While my daughter was on the verge of life and death, I whispered into the ears of my wife, \"Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter?\"And she abruptly told me, \"Please don't blame yourself. You stood for the right cause. You put your life at stake for the cause of truth, for the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you. You both were on the right path and God will protect her.\"These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't ask this question again.When Malala was in the hospital, and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife. But my daughter never complained. She used to tell us, \"I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face. I'll be okay. Please don't worry.\" She was a solace for us, and she consoled us.Dear brothers and sisters, we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times, and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, she is like any 16-year old girl. She cries when her homework is incomplete. She quarrels with her brothers, and I am very happy for that.People ask me, what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised? I tell them, don't ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings, and that's all.Thank you very much.(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

that\n\n00:10:02.637 --> 00:10:06.170\nI valued my daughter.\n\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.483\nWhat my father could not give to my sisters\n\n00:10:10.483 --> 00:10:12.238\nand to his daughters,\n\n00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:16.479\nI thought I must change it.\n\n00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:19.486\nI used to appreciate the intelligence\n\n00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:23.158\nand the brilliance of my daughter.\n\n00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:25.752\nI encouraged her to sit with me\n\n00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:27.411\nwhen my friends used to come.\n\n00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:32.195\nI encouraged her to go with\nme to different meetings.\n\n00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:33.856\nAnd all these good values,\n\n00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:37.066\nI tried to inculcate in her personality.\n\n00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:40.729\nAnd this was not only she, only Malala.\n\n00:10:40.729 --> 00:10:43.465\nI imparted all these good values\n\n00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:48.008\nto my school, girl students \nand boy students as well.\n\n00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:52.387\nI used education for emancipation.\n\n00:10:52.387 --> 00:10:54.252\nI taught my girls,\n\n00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:56.207\nI taught my girl students,\n\n00:10:56.207 --> 00:11:01.276\nto unlearn the lesson of obedience.\n\n00:11:01.276 --> 00:11:04.241\nI taught my boy students\n\n00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:09.722\nto unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.\n\n00:11:13.654 --> 00:11:17.639\nDear brothers and sisters,\n\n00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:22.222\nwe were striving for more rights for women,\n\n00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:25.844\nand we were struggling to have more,\n\n00:11:25.844 --> 00:11:30.071\nmore and more space for the women in society.\n\n00:11:30.071 --> 00:11:33.284\nBut we came across a new phenomenon.\n\n00:11:33.284 --> 00:11:35.777\nIt was lethal to human rights\n\n00:11:35.777 --> 00:11:39.225\nand particularly to women's rights.\n\n00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:43.902\nIt was called Talibanization.\n\n00:11:43.902

forced to wear veils\n\n00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:13.035\nand they were stopped from going to the markets.\n\n00:12:13.035 --> 00:12:15.619\nMusicians were silenced,\n\n00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:17.576\ngirls were flogged\n\n00:12:17.576 --> 00:12:21.059\nand singers were killed.\n\n00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:22.933\nMillions were suffering,\n\n00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:26.178\nbut few spoke,\n\n00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.402\nand it was the most scary thing\n\n00:12:28.402 --> 00:12:34.488\nwhen you have all around such people\n\n00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:36.514\nwho kill and who flog,\n\n00:12:36.514 --> 00:12:37.810\nand you speak for your rights.\n\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.017\nIt's really the most scary thing.\n\n00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:43.910\nAt the age of 10,\n\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.154\nMalala stood, and she stood for the right\n\n00:12:48.154 --> 00:12:50.465\nof education.\n\n00:12:50.465 --> 00:12:55.237\nShe wrote a diary for the BBC

platform she could.\n\n00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:10.339\nAnd her voice was the most powerful voice.\n\n00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:16.592\nIt spread like a crescendo all around the world.\n\n00:13:16.592 --> 00:13:18.444\nAnd that was the reason the Taliban\n\n00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:22.775\ncould not tolerate her campaign,\n\n00:13:22.775 --> 00:13:25.624\nand on October 9 2012,\n\n00:13:25.624 --> 00:13:31.373\nshe was shot in the head at point blank range.\n\n00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:35.518\nIt was a doomsday for my family and for me.\n\n00:13:35.518 --> 00:13:41.337\nThe world turned into a big black hole.\n\n00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:43.003\nWhile my daughter was\n\n00:13:43.003 --> 00:13:46.455\non the verge of life and death,\n\n00:13:46.455 --> 00:13:50.294\nI whispered into the ears of my

told me,\n\n00:13:59.593 --> 00:14:02.104\n\"Please don't blame yourself.\n\n00:14:02.104 --> 00:14:05.320\nYou stood for the right cause.\n\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.455\nYou put your life at

again.\n\n00:14:28.932 --> 00:14:33.052\nWhen Malala was in the hospital,\n\n00:14:33.052 --> 00:14:36.299\nand she was going through the severe pains\n\n00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:38.819\nand she had had severe headaches\n\n00:14:38.819 --> 00:14:42.007\nbecause her facial nerve was cut down,\n\n00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.459\nI used to see a dark shadow\n\n00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:49.996\nspreading on

When I was a little boy, I had an experience that changed my life, and is in fact why I'm here today. That one moment profoundly affected how I think about art, design and engineering.As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world's great cities. My dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15, was an artist by both passion and profession, as is my mom, Rae. He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who, together with his contemporaries, invented American modern art, and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the 20th century. Isn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art, that modern art, comparatively speaking, is about 15 minutes old, yet now pervasive. As with many other important innovations, those radical ideas required no new technology, just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment, plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism and rejection. In our home, art was everywhere. It was like oxygen, around us and necessary for life. As I watched him paint, Dad taught me that art was not about being decorative, but was a different way of communicating ideas, and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight.Given this rich artistic environment, you'd assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business, but no. I followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy. I had no interest in becoming an artist, certainly not a painter. What I did love was electronics and machines \u2014 taking them apart, building new ones, and making them work. Fortunately, my family also had engineers in it, and with my parents, these were my first role models. What they all had in common was they worked very, very hard. My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn. On weekends, we would go together to Cortlandt Street, which was New York City's radio row. There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics, and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers. I found these objects both useful and fascinating. I learned about engineering and how things worked, not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices. I did this for hours every day, apparently avoiding electrocution. Life was good.However, every summer, sadly, the machines got left behind while my parents and I traveled overseas to experience history, art and design. We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East, but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology, they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum, where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology.Then, when I was about nine years old, we went to Rome. On one particularly hot summer day, we visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting. My dad said it was called the Pantheon, a temple for all of the gods. It didn't look all that special from the outside, as I said, but when we walked inside, I was immediately struck by three things: First of all, it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside. It was very dark, the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof. Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole, but it was called the oculus, an eye to the heavens. And there was something about this place, I didn't know why, that just felt special. As we walked to the center of the room, I looked up at the heavens through the oculus. This was the first church that I'd been to that provided an unrestricted view between God and man. But I wondered, what about when it rained? Dad may have called this an oculus, but it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof. I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor. As I became more accustomed to the dark, I was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls. No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff that we'd seen all over Rome. In fact, it looked like the Appian Way marble salesman showed up with his sample book, showed it to Hadrian, and Hadrian said, \"We'll take all of it.\" (Laughter)But the ceiling was amazing. It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome. I'd seen these before, and Bucky was friends with my dad. It was modern, high-tech, impressive, a huge 142-foot clear span which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height. I loved this place. It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before, so I asked my dad, \"When was this built?\" He said, \"About 2,000 years ago.\" And I said, \"No, I mean, the roof.\" You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long-past war. He said, \"It's the original roof.\"That moment changed my life, and I can remember it as if it were yesterday. For the first time, I realized people were smart 2,000 years ago. (Laughter) This had never crossed my mind. I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza, we visited those the year before, and sure they're impressive, nice enough design, but look, give me an unlimited budget, 20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside, and I'll build you pyramids too. But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon, not 2,000 years ago, nor today. And incidentally, it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built. To build the Pantheon took some miracles. By miracles, I mean things that are technically barely possible, very high-risk, and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time, certainly not by you.For example, here are some of the Pantheon's miracles. To make it even structurally possible, they had to invent super-strong concrete, and to control weight, varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome. For strength and lightness, the dome structure used five rings of coffers, each of diminishing size, which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design. It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass, natural convection of air rising up through the oculus, and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building. I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance. The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable, and I realized for the first time that light could be designed. Further, that of all of the forms of design, visual design, they were all kind of irrelevant without it, because without light, you can't see any of them. I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special. It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers and the ravages of time to become what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history.Largely because of that visit, I came to understand that, contrary to what I was being told in school, the worlds of art and design were not, in fact, incompatible with science and engineering. I realized, when combined, you could create things that were amazing that couldn't be done in either domain alone. But in school, with few exceptions, they were treated as separate worlds, and they still are. My teachers told me that I had to get serious and focus on one or the other. However, urging me to specialize only caused me to really  appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, people who did exactly the opposite. And this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds.So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen? Someone themselves, perhaps Hadrian, needed a brilliant creative vision. They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it, and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther. It is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles. The problem is, no matter how talented, rich or smart you are, you only get one to one and a half miracles. That's it. That's the quota. Then you run out of time, money, enthusiasm, whatever. Remember, most people can't even imagine one of these technical miracles, and you need at least five to make a Pantheon. In my experience, these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art, design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach. Driven by the clarity of their vision, they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features. Take the oculus of the Pantheon. By insisting that it be in the design, it meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology that had been developed for Roman arches. However, by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution, they came up with a design that only works if there's a big hole in the roof. That done, you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light, cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens. Not bad. These people not only believed that the impossible can be done, but that it must be done.Enough ancient history. What are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now? Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one, and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either. Talk about one giant leap: It's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another.So what came after the moon? One is tempted to say that today's pantheon is the Internet, but I actually think that's quite wrong, or at least it's only part of the story. The Internet isn't a Pantheon. It's more like the invention of concrete: important, absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon, and enduring, but entirely insufficient by itself. However, just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon, new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure. The smartphone is a perfect example. Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one, and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure.So what's next? What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon? Thinking about this, I rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come, such as curing cancer. Why? Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects, ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them, and will continue to do so indefinitely. It is a different kind of language, like art. These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are, of course, critical, and fantastic, but they're part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology, like the Internet.So what is next? Perhaps counterintuitively, I'm guessing it's a visionary idea from the late 1930s that's been revived every decade since: autonomous vehicles. Now you're thinking, give me a break. How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound? Look, much of our world has been designed around  roads and transportation. These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States. Today, these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years. Although perhaps not obvious today, autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and, by extension, civilization. Here's why: Once they become ubiquitous, each year, these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million globally. Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically. Much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear. They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities, work, and the way we live. We will get where we're going faster and society will recapture vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.But why now? Why do we think this is ready? Because over the last 30 years, people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles, but for entirely different purposes. It took folks like DARPA, universities, and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it, autonomy could be done now. So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles? One, you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is. This was solved neatly by the GPS system, Global Positioning System, that the U.S. Government put in place. You need to know where all the roads are, what the rules are, and where you're going. The various needs of personal navigation systems, in-car navigation systems, and web-based maps address this. You must have near-continuous communication with high-performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent. The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices, with some minor modifications, are completely suitable to solve this. You'll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this. This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there. But finally, you need to recognize people, signs and objects. Machine vision, special sensors, and high-performance computing can do a lot of this, but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board. Occasionally, humans will  need to do sense-making. For this, you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road. Not so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world. Besides, once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant, and it's okay to keep driving, every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on.Five miracles, mostly delivered, and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful  and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home. The beginning is now only a handful of years away, and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades.In conclusion, I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us, just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge, multidisciplinary skills, and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality. But these people don't spontaneously pop into existence. They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they're little kids. We need to love them and help them discover their passions. We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success, as is perseverance. We need to help them to find their own role models, and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible, and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus, and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums, we need to encourage them to find their own path, even if it's very different from our own.But a cautionary note: We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles, the computers, phones, tablets, game machines and TVs, take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world, our planet and our civilization. If we don't, they won't understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving. We also need them to understand something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech-dependent world, that art and design are not luxuries, nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering. They are in fact essential to what makes us special.Someday, if you get the chance, perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon, as we will our daughter Kira, to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design, which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome, reached 2,000 years into the future to set the course for my life.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1956, "subtitle":

had an experience that changed my life,\n\n00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.057\nand is in fact why I'm here today.\n\n00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:24.998\nThat one moment\n\n00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:27.260\nprofoundly affected how I think about\n\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.481\nart, design and engineering.\n\n00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.238\nAs background, I was fortunate enough to grow up\n\n00:00:33.238 --> 00:00:36.951\nin a family of loving and talented artists\n\n00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:39.515\nin one of the world's great cities.\n\n00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:43.392\nMy dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,\n\n00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:46.922\nwas an artist by both passion and profession,\n\n00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.182\nas is my mom, Rae.\n\n00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.987\nHe was one of the New York School\n\n00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:52.748\nabstract expressionists who,\n\n00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:55.260\ntogether with his contemporaries,\n\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.158\ninvented American modern art,\n\n00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.343\nand contributed to moving the American zeitgeist\n\n00:01:01.343 --> 00:01:05.886\ntowards modernism in the 20th century.\n\n00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:08.807\nIsn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years\n\n00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:12.448\nof people doing mostly representational art,\n\n00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:14.481\nthat modern art, comparatively speaking,\n\n00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:16.821\nis about 15 minutes old,\n\n00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:18.719\nyet now pervasive.\n\n00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.663\nAs with many other important innovations,\n\n00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:24.283\nthose radical ideas required no new technology,\n\n00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.176\njust fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,\n\n00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:31.344\nplus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism\n\n00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:32.798\nand rejection.\n\n00:01:32.798 --> 00:01:35.315\nIn our home, art was everywhere.\n\n00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:36.886\nIt was like oxygen,\n\n00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:40.048\naround us and necessary for life.\n\n00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:41.907\nAs I watched him paint,\n\n00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:44.214\nDad taught me that art\n\n00:01:44.214 --> 00:01:46.423\nwas not about being decorative,\n\n00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:49.537\nbut was a different way of communicating ideas,\n\n00:01:49.537 --> 00:01:51.574\nand in fact one that could bridge the worlds\n\n00:01:51.574 --> 00:01:54.502\nof knowledge and insight.\n\n00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:56.642\nGiven this rich artistic environment,\n\n00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:58.257\nyou'd assume that I would have been compelled\n\n00:01:58.257 --> 00:02:00.366\nto go into the family business,\n\n00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.982\nbut no.\n\n00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:04.769\nI followed the path of most kids\n\n00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:06.119\nwho are genetically programmed\n\n00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.318\nto make their parents crazy.\n\n00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:10.941\nI had no interest in becoming an artist,\n\n00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:12.501\ncertainly not a painter.\n\n00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.800\nWhat I did love was electronics and machines --\n\n00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.420\ntaking them apart, building new ones,\n\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.307\nand making them work.\n\n00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:23.209\nFortunately, my family also had engineers in it,\n\n00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.417\nand with my parents,\n\n00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.045\nthese were my first role models.\n\n00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:28.402\nWhat they all had in common\n\n00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:31.110\nwas they worked very, very hard.\n\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.480\nMy grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal\n\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.180\nkitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.\n\n00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.604\nOn weekends, we would go\ntogether to Cortlandt Street,\n\n00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:42.279\nwhich was New York City's radio row.\n\n00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.082\nThere we would explore massive piles\n\n00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:46.303\nof surplus electronics,\n\n00:02:46.303 --> 00:02:48.605\nand for a few bucks bring home treasures\n\n00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:50.037\nlike Norden bombsights\n\n00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:54.548\nand parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.\n\n00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:57.614\nI found these objects both useful and fascinating.\n\n00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:00.245\nI learned about engineering and how things worked,\n\n00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:01.705\nnot at school\n\n00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:03.494\nbut by taking apart and studying\n\n00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:05.971\nthese fabulously complex devices.\n\n00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.555\nI did this for hours every day,\n\n00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.853\napparently avoiding electrocution.\n\n00:03:11.853 --> 00:03:13.425\nLife was good.\n\n00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.746\nHowever, every summer, sadly,\n\n00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:17.779\nthe machines got left behind\n\n00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.983\nwhile my parents and I traveled overseas\n\n00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:23.623\nto experience history, art and design.\n\n00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:26.017\nWe visited the great museums and historic buildings\n\n00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:27.877\nof both Europe and the Middle East,\n\n00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:30.137\nbut to encourage my growing interest\n\n00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:31.952\nin science and technology,\n\n00:03:31.952 --> 00:03:34.236\nthey would simply drop me off in places\n\n00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:36.676\nlike the London Science Museum,\n\n00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:40.394\nwhere I would wander endlessly for hours by myself\n\n00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:44.370\nstudying the history of science and technology.\n\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.634\nThen, when I was about nine years old,\n\n00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:49.502\nwe went to Rome.\n\n00:03:49.502 --> 00:03:51.863\nOn one particularly hot summer day,\n\n00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:54.742\nwe visited a drum-shaped\nbuilding that from the outside\n\n00:03:54.742 --> 00:03:56.986\nwas not particularly interesting.\n\n00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.311\nMy dad said it was called the Pantheon,\n\n00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:01.779\na temple for all of the gods.\n\n00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.053\nIt didn't look all that special from the outside,\n\n00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:06.492\nas I said, but when we walked inside,\n\n00:04:06.492 --> 00:04:09.805\nI was immediately struck by three things:\n\n00:04:09.805 --> 00:04:13.035\nFirst of all, it was pleasantly cool\n\n00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:15.113\ndespite the oppressive heat outside.\n\n00:04:15.113 --> 00:04:17.827\nIt was very dark, the only source of light\n\n00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:20.300\nbeing an big open hole in the roof.\n\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.533\nDad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,\n\n00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.347\nbut it was called the oculus,\n\n00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.723\nan eye to the heavens.\n\n00:04:26.723 --> 00:04:28.868\nAnd there was something about this place,\n\n00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:31.871\nI didn't know why, that just felt special.\n\n00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.869\nAs we walked to the center of the room,\n\n00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:36.690\nI looked up at the heavens through the oculus.\n\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.987\nThis was the first church that I'd been to\n\n00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.190\nthat provided an unrestricted view\n\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.348\nbetween God and man.\n\n00:04:44.348 --> 00:04:47.778\nBut I wondered, what about when it rained?\n\n00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:49.635\nDad may have called this an oculus,\n\n00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:52.722\nbut it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.\n\n00:04:52.722 --> 00:04:54.551\nI looked down and saw floor drains\n\n00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:57.136\nhad been cut into the stone floor.\n\n00:04:57.136 --> 00:04:59.595\nAs I became more accustomed to the dark,\n\n00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:01.859\nI was able to make out details of the floor\n\n00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:03.589\nand the surrounding walls.\n\n00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:06.166\nNo big deal here, just the same statuary stuff\n\n00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:08.082\nthat we'd seen all over Rome.\n\n00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:09.754\nIn fact, it looked like the Appian Way\n\n00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:11.950\nmarble salesman showed up\n\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.398\nwith his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,\n\n00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:17.038\nand Hadrian said, \"We'll take all of it.\"\n\n00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:18.744\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:21.962\nBut the ceiling was amazing.\n\n00:05:21.962 --> 00:05:24.798\nIt looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.\n\n00:05:24.798 --> 00:05:26.107\nI'd seen these before,\n\n00:05:26.107 --> 00:05:28.351\nand Bucky was friends with my dad.\n\n00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:31.842\nIt was modern, high-tech, impressive,\n\n00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:34.279\na huge 142-foot clear span\n\n00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.522\nwhich, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.\n\n00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:38.784\nI loved this place.\n\n00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:42.203\nIt was really beautiful and unlike\nanything I'd ever seen before,\n\n00:05:42.203 --> 00:05:45.773\nso I asked my dad, \"When was this built?\"\n\n00:05:45.773 --> 00:05:48.905\nHe said, \"About 2,000 years ago.\"\n\n00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:51.409\nAnd I said, \"No, I mean, the roof.\"\n\n00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.368\nYou see, I assumed that this was a modern roof\n\n00:05:53.368 --> 00:05:55.286\nthat had been put on because the original\n\n00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:58.832\nwas destroyed in some long-past war.\n\n00:05:58.832 --> 00:06:02.294\nHe said, \"It's the original roof.\"\n\n00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:04.772\nThat moment changed my life,\n\n00:06:04.772 --> 00:06:07.421\nand I can remember it as if it were yesterday.\n\n00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:10.016\nFor the first time, I realized people were smart\n\n00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.156\n2,000 years ago. (Laughter)\n\n00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:14.270\nThis had never crossed my mind.\n\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.141\nI mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,\n\n00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:20.069\nwe visited those the year before,\n\n00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.989\nand sure they're impressive, nice enough design,\n\n00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:25.444\nbut look, give me an unlimited budget,\n\n00:06:25.444 --> 00:06:29.441\n20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years\n\n00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:33.057\nto cut and drag stone blocks \nacross the countryside,\n\n00:06:33.057 --> 00:06:35.821\nand I'll build you pyramids too.\n\n00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:38.624\nBut no amount of brute force\n\n00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:41.666\ngets you the dome of the Pantheon,\n\n00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:44.685\nnot 2,000 years ago, nor today.\n\n00:06:44.685 --> 00:06:47.425\nAnd incidentally, it is still the largest\n\n00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:51.239\nunreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.\n\n00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:54.234\nTo build the Pantheon took some miracles.\n\n00:06:54.234 --> 00:06:56.666\nBy miracles, I mean things that are\n\n00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.253\ntechnically barely possible,\n\n00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:02.325\nvery high-risk, and might not be\n\n00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:04.909\nactually accomplishable at this moment in time,\n\n00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:09.161\ncertainly not by you.\n\n00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:12.286\nFor example, here are some\nof the Pantheon's miracles.\n\n00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:14.979\nTo make it even structurally possible,\n\n00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.546\nthey had to invent super-strong concrete,\n\n00:07:17.546 --> 00:07:19.495\nand to control weight,\n\n00:07:19.495 --> 00:07:21.563\nvaried the density of the aggregate\n\n00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:24.331\nas they worked their way up the dome.\n\n00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:26.632\nFor strength and lightness, the dome structure\n\n00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:28.669\nused five rings of coffers,\n\n00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.276\neach of diminishing size,\n\n00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:33.012\nwhich imparts a dramatic forced perspective\n\n00:07:33.012 --> 00:07:35.019\nto the design.\n\n00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:36.944\nIt was wonderfully cool inside\n\n00:07:36.944 --> 00:07:39.127\nbecause of its huge thermal mass,\n\n00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:41.212\nnatural convection of air rising up\n\n00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:42.613\nthrough the oculus,\n\n00:07:42.613 --> 00:07:45.088\nand a Venturi effect when wind blows across\n\n00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:47.391\nthe top of the building.\n\n00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:51.351\nI discovered for the first time that light itself\n\n00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.318\nhas substance.\n\n00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:55.995\nThe shaft of light beaming through the oculus\n\n00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:58.485\nwas both beautiful and palpable,\n\n00:07:58.485 --> 00:08:00.742\nand I realized for the first time\n\n00:08:00.742 --> 00:08:02.643\nthat light could be designed.\n\n00:08:02.643 --> 00:08:07.517\nFurther, that of all of the forms of design,\n\n00:08:07.517 --> 00:08:08.893\nvisual design,\n\n00:08:08.893 --> 00:08:10.724\nthey were all kind of irrelevant without it,\n\n00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:14.585\nbecause without light, you can't see any of them.\n\n00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:17.037\nI also realized that I wasn't the first person\n\n00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:20.296\nto think that this place was really special.\n\n00:08:20.296 --> 00:08:24.673\nIt survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers\n\n00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:26.572\nand the ravages of time to become\n\n00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.952\nwhat I believe is the longest\n\n00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:30.909\ncontinuously occupied building in history.\n\n00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:33.125\nLargely because of that visit,\n\n00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:34.662\nI came to understand that,\n\n00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:37.301\ncontrary to what I was being told in school,\n\n00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:39.330\nthe worlds of art and design\n\n00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.346\nwere not, in fact, incompatible\n\n00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:43.022\nwith science and engineering.\n\n00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.115\nI realized, when combined,\n\n00:08:45.115 --> 00:08:47.878\nyou could create things that were amazing\n\n00:08:47.878 --> 00:08:50.724\nthat couldn't be done in either domain alone.\n\n00:08:50.724 --> 00:08:53.157\nBut in school, with few exceptions,\n\n00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.077\nthey were treated as separate worlds,\n\n00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:57.220\nand they still are.\n\n00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.916\nMy teachers told me that I had to get serious\n\n00:08:59.916 --> 00:09:02.089\nand focus on one or the other.\n\n00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:05.184\nHowever, urging me to specialize\n\n00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:08.494\nonly caused me to really \nappreciate those polymaths\n\n00:09:08.494 --> 00:09:12.644\nlike Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,\n\n00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:14.069\nBenjamin Franklin,\n\n00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:16.779\npeople who did exactly the opposite.\n\n00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:18.968\nAnd this led me to embrace\n\n00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:21.938\nand want to be in both worlds.\n\n00:09:21.938 --> 00:09:27.766\nSo then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity\n\n00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:30.260\nlike the Pantheon actually happen?\n\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.188\nSomeone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,\n\n00:09:34.188 --> 00:09:37.379\nneeded a brilliant creative vision.\n\n00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:40.172\nThey also needed the storytelling\nand leadership skills\n\n00:09:40.172 --> 00:09:42.950\nnecessary to fund and execute it,\n\n00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.812\nand a mastery of science and technology\n\n00:09:45.812 --> 00:09:47.895\nwith the ability and knowhow\n\n00:09:47.895 --> 00:09:51.941\nto push existing innovations even farther.\n\n00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:55.861\nIt is my belief that to create\nthese rare game changers\n\n00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:59.991\nrequires you to pull off at least five miracles.\n\n00:09:59.991 --> 00:10:02.684\nThe problem is, no matter how talented,\n\n00:10:02.684 --> 00:10:04.416\nrich or smart you are,\n\n00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:07.442\nyou only get one to one and a half miracles.\n\n00:10:07.442 --> 00:10:09.224\nThat's it. That's the quota.\n\n00:10:09.224 --> 00:10:11.837\nThen you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,\n\n00:10:11.837 --> 00:10:13.216\nwhatever.\n\n00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:15.493\nRemember, most people can't even imagine\n\n00:10:15.493 --> 00:10:17.400\none of these technical miracles,\n\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.509\nand you need at least five to make a Pantheon.\n\n00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:23.010\nIn my experience, these rare visionaries\n\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.847\nwho can think across the worlds of art,\n\n00:10:24.847 --> 00:10:26.674\ndesign and engineering\n\n00:10:26.674 --> 00:10:28.876\nhave the ability to notice\n\n00:10:28.876 --> 00:10:31.593\nwhen others have provided enough of the miracles\n\n00:10:31.593 --> 00:10:34.149\nto bring the goal within reach.\n\n00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:36.786\nDriven by the clarity of their vision,\n\n00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:39.096\nthey summon the courage and determination\n\n00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:41.193\nto deliver the remaining miracles\n\n00:10:41.193 --> 00:10:44.743\nand they often take what other people think to be\n\n00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:46.789\ninsurmountable obstacles\n\n00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:48.574\nand turn them into features.\n\n00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:51.501\nTake the oculus of the Pantheon.\n\n00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:53.399\nBy insisting that it be in the design,\n\n00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:56.272\nit meant you couldn't use much\nof the structural technology\n\n00:10:56.272 --> 00:10:59.246\nthat had been developed for Roman arches.\n\n00:10:59.246 --> 00:11:02.144\nHowever, by instead embracing it\n\n00:11:02.144 --> 00:11:04.732\nand rethinking weight and stress distribution,\n\n00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:07.214\nthey came up with a design that only works\n\n00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:09.118\nif there's a big hole in the roof.\n\n00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:12.125\nThat done, you now get the aesthetic\n\n00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:16.506\nand design benefits of light, cooling\n\n00:11:16.506 --> 00:11:19.806\nand that critical direct connection with the heavens.\n\n00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:21.850\nNot bad.\n\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.911\nThese people not only believed\n\n00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:25.967\nthat the impossible can be done,\n\n00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:28.793\nbut that it must be done.\n\n00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:30.894\nEnough ancient history.\n\n00:11:30.894 --> 00:11:34.027\nWhat are some recent examples of innovations\n\n00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.906\nthat combine creative design\n\n00:11:35.906 --> 00:11:39.149\nand technological advances in a way so profound\n\n00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:40.478\nthat they will be remembered\n\n00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:42.311\na thousand years from now?\n\n00:11:42.311 --> 00:11:45.407\nWell, putting a man on the moon was a good one,\n\n00:11:45.407 --> 00:11:48.424\nand returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.\n\n00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:50.916\nTalk about one giant leap:\n\n00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:53.364\nIt's hard to imagine a more profound moment\n\n00:11:53.364 --> 00:11:54.676\nin human history\n\n00:11:54.676 --> 00:11:56.849\nthan when we first left our world\n\n00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.740\nto set foot on another.\n\n00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.961\nSo what came after the moon?\n\n00:12:00.961 --> 00:12:03.769\nOne is tempted to say that today's pantheon\n\n00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:05.430\nis the Internet,\n\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.899\nbut I actually think that's quite wrong,\n\n00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:10.754\nor at least it's only part of the story.\n\n00:12:10.754 --> 00:12:13.270\nThe Internet isn't a Pantheon.\n\n00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.861\nIt's more like the invention of concrete:\n\n00:12:15.861 --> 00:12:18.436\nimportant, absolutely necessary\n\n00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:19.876\nto build the Pantheon,\n\n00:12:19.876 --> 00:12:21.232\nand enduring,\n\n00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:24.423\nbut entirely insufficient by itself.\n\n00:12:24.423 --> 00:12:27.355\nHowever, just as the technology of concrete\n\n00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:30.942\nwas critical in realization of the Pantheon,\n\n00:12:30.942 --> 00:12:34.157\nnew designers will use the\ntechnologies of the Internet\n\n00:12:34.157 --> 00:12:37.355\nto create novel concepts that will endure.\n\n00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:39.413\nThe smartphone is a perfect example.\n\n00:12:39.413 --> 00:12:41.158\nSoon the majority of people on the planet\n\n00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:42.492\nwill have one,\n\n00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.893\nand the idea of connecting everyone\n\n00:12:44.893 --> 00:12:48.143\nto both knowledge and each other will endure.\n\n00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:49.451\nSo what's next?\n\n00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:52.857\nWhat imminent advance will be\nthe equivalent of the Pantheon?\n\n00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:54.292\nThinking about this,\n\n00:12:54.292 --> 00:12:56.839\nI rejected many very plausible\n\n00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:58.735\nand dramatic breakthroughs to come,\n\n00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:00.752\nsuch as curing cancer.\n\n00:13:00.752 --> 00:13:04.090\nWhy? Because Pantheons are anchored\n\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.025\nin designed physical objects,\n\n00:13:07.025 --> 00:13:09.347\nones that inspire by simply seeing\n\n00:13:09.347 --> 00:13:10.767\nand experiencing them,\n\n00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:13.649\nand will continue to do so indefinitely.\n\n00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:18.222\nIt is a different kind of language, like art.\n\n00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:20.994\nThese other vital contributions that extend life\n\n00:13:20.994 --> 00:13:23.687\nand relieve suffering are, of course, critical,\n\n00:13:23.687 --> 00:13:25.374\nand fantastic,\n\n00:13:25.374 --> 00:13:27.167\nbut they're part of the continuum of\n\n00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:29.679\nour overall knowledge and technology,\n\n00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:32.203\nlike the Internet.\n\n00:13:32.203 --> 00:13:34.547\nSo what is next?\n\n00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:36.266\nPerhaps counterintuitively,\n\n00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:38.578\nI'm guessing it's a visionary idea\n\n00:13:38.578 --> 00:13:40.432\nfrom the late 1930s\n\n00:13:40.432 --> 00:13:43.592\nthat's been revived every decade since:\n\n00:13:43.592 --> 00:13:45.606\nautonomous vehicles.\n\n00:13:45.606 --> 00:13:47.344\nNow you're thinking, give me a break.\n\n00:13:47.344 --> 00:13:50.862\nHow can a fancy version of cruise control\n\n00:13:50.862 --> 00:13:52.562\nbe profound?\n\n00:13:52.562 --> 00:13:54.686\nLook, much of our world\n\n00:13:54.686 --> 00:13:58.169\nhas been designed around \nroads and transportation.\n\n00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:00.044\nThese were as essential to the success\n\n00:14:00.044 --> 00:14:01.542\nof the Roman Empire\n\n00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:03.527\nas the interstate highway system\n\n00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:05.321\nto the prosperity and development\n\n00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.531\nof the United States.\n\n00:14:07.531 --> 00:14:10.565\nToday, these roads that interconnect our world\n\n00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:12.663\nare dominated by cars and trucks\n\n00:14:12.663 --> 00:14:14.531\nthat have remained largely unchanged\n\n00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:17.102\nfor 100 years.\n\n00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:20.361\nAlthough perhaps not obvious today,\n\n00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:24.946\nautonomous vehicles will be the key technology\n\n00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:28.044\nthat enables us to redesign our cities\n\n00:14:28.044 --> 00:14:30.263\nand, by extension, civilization.\n\n00:14:30.263 --> 00:14:31.865\nHere's why:\n\n00:14:31.865 --> 00:14:33.618\nOnce they become ubiquitous,\n\n00:14:33.618 --> 00:14:36.155\neach year, these vehicles will save\n\n00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:39.263\ntens of thousands of lives in the United States alone\n\n00:14:39.263 --> 00:14:42.390\nand a million globally.\n\n00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.289\nAutomotive energy consumption and air pollution\n\n00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:47.662\nwill be cut dramatically.\n\n00:14:47.662 --> 00:14:49.067\nMuch of the road congestion\n\n00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:52.877\nin and out of our cities will disappear.\n\n00:14:52.877 --> 00:14:55.564\nThey will enable compelling new concepts\n\n00:14:55.564 --> 00:14:58.033\nin how we design cities, work,\n\n00:14:58.033 --> 00:14:59.970\nand the way we live.\n\n00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.516\nWe will get where we're going faster\n\n00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:05.514\nand society will recapture vast amounts\n\n00:15:05.514 --> 00:15:06.805\nof lost productivity\n\n00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:10.446\nnow spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.\n\n00:15:10.446 --> 00:15:13.719\nBut why now? Why do we think this is ready?\n\n00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:15.913\nBecause over the last 30 years,\n\n00:15:15.913 --> 00:15:17.961\npeople from outside the automotive industry\n\n00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:20.069\nhave spent countless billions\n\n00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:21.804\ncreating the needed miracles,\n\n00:15:21.804 --> 00:15:24.676\nbut for entirely different purposes.\n\n00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:27.304\nIt took folks like DARPA, universities,\n\n00:15:27.304 --> 00:15:30.468\nand companies completely\noutside of the automotive industry\n\n00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:32.769\nto notice that if

"https://www.ted.com/talks/ed_yong_suicidal_wasps_zombie_roaches_and_other_tales_of_parasites", "transcript": "A herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish, a flock of birds. Many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world. But why do these groups form? The common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs or gathering to mate or breed, and all of these explanations, while often true, make a huge assumption about animal behavior, that the animals are in control of their own actions, that they are in charge of their bodies. And that is often not the case.This is Artemia, a brine shrimp. You probably know it better as a sea monkey. It's small, and it typically lives alone, but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters, and these form because of a parasite. These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm. A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other. As a freelance journalist, I sympathize. (Laughter) The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body, but it also does other things. It castrates them, it changes their color from transparent to bright red, it makes them live longer, and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found, it makes them swim in groups. Why? Because the tapeworm, like many other parasites, has a complicated life cycle involving many different hosts. The shrimp are just one step on its journey. Its ultimate destination is this, the greater flamingo. Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce, so to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour, and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm. They aren't sociable through their own volition, but because they are being controlled. It's not safety in numbers. It's actually the exact opposite. The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies, turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo.And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation. This is a suicidal cricket. This cricket swallowed the  larvae of a Gordian worm, or horsehair worm. The worm grew to adult size within it, but it needs to get into water in order to mate, and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain, causing it to behave erratically. When the cricket nears a body of water, such as this swimming pool, it jumps in and drowns, and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse. Crickets are really roomy. Who knew?The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone. They are part of an entire cavalcade of mind-controlling parasites, of fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts. Now, I first learned about this way of life through David Attenborough's \"Trials of Life\" about 20 years ago, and then later through a wonderful book called \"Parasite Rex\" by my friend Carl Zimmer. And I've been writing about these creatures ever since. Few topics in biology enthrall me more. It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain. Because after all, they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre. When you write about parasites, your lexicon swells with phrases like \"devoured alive\" and \"bursts out of its body.\" (Laughter)But there's more to it than that. I'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories. Parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories. Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations. Why, for example, does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over? Is it maybe protecting its siblings? No. This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it. The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body. See what I mean? Now, the caterpillar didn't die. Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons. This caterpillar is a head-banging  zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it.(Applause)We have a lot to get through.  I only have 13 minutes. (Laughter)Now, some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world, that they are outliers, and that point of view is understandable, because by their nature, parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things. They're easy to overlook, but that doesn't mean that they aren't important. A few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find, and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance. Especially common were trematodes, tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail. Now, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic, but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds. And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you, the cricket thing? One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream, these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout. Manipulation is not an oddity. It is a critical and common part of the world around us, and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators, and more excitingly, they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts.And this is one of my favorite examples. This is Ampulex compressa, the emerald cockroach wasp, and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach. When she finds one, she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ. This discovery came out three weeks ago. She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach's brain. So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag, she finds the brain, and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons. Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon. It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it. The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to, but it doesn't choose to, because the venom nixes its motivation to walk, and only that. The wasp basically un-checks the escape-from-danger box in the roach's operating system, allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog. And once there, she lays an egg on it, egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body, yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. (Laughter) (Applause)Now I would argue that, once stung, the cockroach isn't a roach anymore. It's more of an extension of the wasp, just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm. These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce. They have as much control over their own fates as my car. Once the parasites get in, the hosts don't get a say.Now humans, of course, are no stranger to manipulation. We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods, and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind? But our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites. Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp. Now, I think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling. We place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears. Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind-controlling supervillains \u2014 these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction, but in nature, they happen all the time.Which leads me to an obvious and disquieting question: Are there dark, sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it, besides the NSA? If there are any \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) I've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I? (Laughter)If there are any, this is a good candidate for them. This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short, because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname. Toxo infects mammals, a wide variety of mammals, but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat. And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse, it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile. If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss, it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away. The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex. It's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love. (Laughter) (Applause)You're very charitable, generous people. Hi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.How does the parasite control its host in this way? We don't really know. We know that Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine, a substance involved in reward and motivation. We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain, including those involved in sexual arousal. But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear. What is clear is that this thing is a single cell. This has no nervous system. It has no consciousness. It doesn't even have a body. But it's manipulating a mammal? We are mammals. We are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure, but our brains have the same basic structure, the same types of cells, the same chemicals running through them, and the same parasites. Estimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains. Now typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness. The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time. But there's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people, that they have a slightly  higher risk of car accidents, and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected. Now, I think this evidence is still inconclusive, and even among Toxo researchers, opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior. But given the widespread nature of such manipulations, it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't similarly affected.And I think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing. They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways, and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing, whether they're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling, are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else. And while that idea may be disquieting, and while parasites' habits may be very grisly, I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin.At the end of \"On the Origin of Species,\" Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life, and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful, and I like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks.But perhaps, that's just a parasite talking.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1955, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:15.154\nA herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,\n\n00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:16.783\na flock of birds.\n\n00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.851\nMany animals gather in large groups\n\n00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:20.837\nthat are among the most wonderful spectacles\n\n00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.555\nin the natural world.\n\n00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.279\nBut why do these groups form?\n\n00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.916\nThe common answers include things like\n\n00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:29.882\nseeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs\n\n00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.378\nor gathering to mate or breed,\n\n00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:34.046\nand all of these explanations,\n\n00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:35.283\nwhile often true,\n\n00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:38.326\nmake a huge assumption about animal behavior,\n\n00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:41.503\nthat the animals are in control of their own actions,\n\n00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:43.754\nthat they are in charge of their bodies.\n\n00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:47.181\nAnd that is often not the case.\n\n00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.105\nThis is Artemia, a brine shrimp.\n\n00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:52.869\nYou probably know it better as a sea monkey.\n\n00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:54.864\nIt's small, and it typically lives alone,\n\n00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:57.941\nbut it can gather in these large red swarms\n\n00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.188\nthat span for meters,\n\n00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:03.278\nand these form because of a parasite.\n\n00:01:03.278 --> 00:01:05.964\nThese shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.\n\n00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:08.215\nA tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut\n\n00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:11.103\nwith genitals at one end and\na hooked mouth at the other.\n\n00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:13.638\nAs a freelance journalist, I sympathize.\n\n00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:15.793\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:18.701\nThe tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,\n\n00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:20.778\nbut it also does other things.\n\n00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:22.398\nIt castrates them,\n\n00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:27.116\nit changes their color from transparent to bright red,\n\n00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:28.632\nit makes them live longer,\n\n00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:30.989\nand as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,\n\n00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.348\nit makes them swim in groups.\n\n00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:37.800\nWhy?

00:07:08.893\nIsraeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal\n\n00:07:08.893 --> 00:07:12.618\nfound that the venom is a\nvery specific chemical weapon.\n\n00:07:12.618 --> 00:07:15.162\nIt doesn't

this\n\n00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:27.990\nare crude and blundering compared\n\n00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.085\nto the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.\n\n00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:33.477\nDon Draper only wishes he was as elegant\n\n00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:38.437\nand precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.\n\n00:08:38.437 --> 00:08:42.177\nNow, I think this is part of what makes parasites\n\n00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:44.963\nso sinister and so compelling.\n\n00:08:44.963 --> 00:08:47.585\nWe place such a premium on our free will\n\n00:08:47.585 --> 00:08:48.846\nand our

00:09:02.208\nthese are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,\n\n00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:07.006\nbut in nature, they happen all the time.\n\n00:09:07.006 --> 00:09:09.638\nWhich leads me to an obvious\n\n00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:11.938\nand disquieting question:\n\n00:09:11.938 --> 00:09:13.661\nAre there dark, sinister parasites\n\n00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:15.617\nthat are influencing our behavior\n\n00:09:15.617 --> 00:09:17.192\nwithout us knowing about it,\n\n00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:20.011\nbesides the NSA?\n\n00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.318\nIf there are any \u2014\n\n00:09:21.318 -->

there are any, this is a good candidate for them.\n\n00:09:33.087 --> 00:09:36.365\nThis is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,\n\n00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:37.954\nbecause the terrifying creature\n\n00:09:37.954 --> 00:09:40.164\nalways deserves a cute nickname.\n\n00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:42.446\nToxo infects mammals,\n\n00:09:42.446 --> 00:09:43.924\na wide variety of mammals,\n\n00:09:43.924 --> 00:09:47.005\nbut it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.\n\n00:09:47.005 --> 00:09:49.766\nAnd scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that\n\n00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:51.959\nif Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,\n\n00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:55.431\nit turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.\n\n00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:58.507\nIf the infected rat smells the

direction of away.\n\n00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.905\nThe cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.\n\n00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:11.777\nIt's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.\n\n00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:16.445\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.672\nYou're very charitable, generous people.\n\n00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:25.257\nHi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.\n\n00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:28.625\nHow does the parasite control its host\n\n00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:29.829\nin this way?\n\n00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.155\nWe don't really know.\n\n00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:32.843\nWe know that Toxo releases an enzyme\n\n00:10:32.843 --> 00:10:34.835\nthat makes dopamine, a substance involved\n\n00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.648\nin reward and motivation.\n\n00:10:36.648 --> 00:10:39.079\nWe know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,\n\n00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:41.544\nincluding those involved in sexual arousal.\n\n00:10:41.544 --> 00:10:43.745\nBut how those puzzle pieces fit together\n\n00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:45.589\nis not immediately clear.\n\n00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:47.885\nWhat is clear is that this thing\n\n00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:49.277\nis a single cell.\n\n00:10:49.277 --> 00:10:50.647\nThis has no nervous system.\n\n00:10:50.647 --> 00:10:51.779\nIt has no consciousness.\n\n00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:53.080\nIt doesn't even have a body.\n\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.704\nBut it's manipulating a mammal?\n\n00:10:55.704 --> 00:10:57.130\nWe are mammals.\n\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.564\nWe are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,\n\n00:10:59.564 --> 00:11:02.088\nbut our brains have the same basic structure,\n\n00:11:02.088 --> 00:11:03.481\nthe same types of cells,\n\n00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.069\nthe same chemicals running through them,\n\n00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:07.388\nand the same parasites.\n\n00:11:07.388 --> 00:11:09.736\nEstimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest\n\n00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:12.096\nthat one in three people around the world\n\n00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:13.809\nhave Toxo in their brains.\n\n00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:17.297\nNow typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.\n\n00:11:17.297 --> 00:11:19.175\nThe parasite holds up in a dormant state\n\n00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:21.358\nfor a long period of time.\n\n00:11:21.358 --> 00:11:23.397\nBut there's some evidence that those people\n\n00:11:23.397 --> 00:11:26.431\nwho are carriers score slightly differently\n\n00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:29.160\non personality questionnaires than other people,\n\n00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.644\nthat they have a slightly \nhigher risk of car accidents,\n\n00:11:31.644 --> 00:11:34.247\nand there's some evidence\nthat people with schizophrenia\n\n00:11:34.247 --> 00:11:36.793\nare more likely to be infected.\n\n00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:38.976\nNow, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,\n\n00:11:38.976 --> 00:11:40.887\nand even among Toxo researchers,\n\n00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:43.327\nopinion is divided as to whether the parasite\n\n00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:45.712\nis truly influencing our behavior.\n\n00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:48.371\nBut given the widespread\nnature of such manipulations,\n\n00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:50.216\nit would be completely implausible\n\n00:11:50.216 --> 00:11:51.865\nfor humans to be the only species\n\n00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:54.811\nthat weren't similarly affected.\n\n00:11:54.811 --> 00:11:59.204\nAnd I think that this capacity to constantly\n\n00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:02.071\nsubvert our way of thinking about the world\n\n00:12:02.071 --> 00:12:03.618\nmakes parasites amazing.\n\n00:12:03.618 --> 00:12:06.827\nThey're constantly inviting us to\nlook at the natural world sideways,\n\n00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.998\nand to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,\n\n00:12:08.998 --> 00:12:10.485\nwhether they're simple and obvious\n\n00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:12.018\nor baffling and puzzling,\n\n00:12:12.018 --> 00:12:14.104\nare not the results of individuals\n\n00:12:14.104 --> 00:12:15.957\nacting through their own accord\n\n00:12:15.957 --> 00:12:17.766\nbut because they are being bent\n\n00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:20.436\nto the control of something else.\n\n00:12:20.436 --> 00:12:22.476\nAnd while that idea may be disquieting,\n\n00:12:22.476 --> 00:12:25.399\nand while parasites' habits may be very grisly,\n\n00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:27.191\nI think that ability to surprise us\n\n00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:30.366\nmakes them as wonderful and as charismatic\n\n00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:33.730\nas any panda or butterfly or dolphin.\n\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.949\nAt the end of \"On the Origin of Species,\"\n\n00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:38.938\nCharles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,\n\n00:12:38.938 -->

from themselves)", "duration": "559", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/del_harvey_the_strangeness_of_scale_at_twitter", "transcript": "My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust, protect user rights and keep users safe, both from each other and, at times, from themselves. Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter. Back in January 2009, we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform. January 2014, more than 500 million. We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes. That's a 24,900-percent increase.Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. There's no risk involved. My job is to root out and prevent activity that might. Sounds straightforward, right? You might even think it'd be easy, given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities? Given the scale that Twitter is at, a one-in-a-million chance happens 500 times a day. It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale. For us, edge cases, those rare situations that are unlikely to occur, are more like norms. Say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone. There's no threat involved. Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef, or tweeting about a concert they're attending, or sharing pictures of cute baby animals. After you take out that 99.999 percent, that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly 150,000 per month. The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge.You know what else makes my role particularly challenging? People do weird things. (Laughter) And I have to figure out what they're doing, why, and whether or not there's risk involved, often without much in terms of context or background. I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter \u2014 these are all real examples \u2014 of situations that at first seemed cut and dried, but the truth of the matter was something altogether different. The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty. We'll start off easy.[\"Yo bitch\"]If you saw a Tweet that only said this, you might think to yourself, \"That looks like abuse.\" After all, why would you want to receive the message, \"Yo, bitch.\" Now, I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes, so I knew that \"yo, bitch\" was also often a common greeting between friends, as well as being a popular \"Breaking Bad\" reference. I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case. It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role-playing as dogs. (Laughter) And in fact, in that case, it's not only not abusive, it's technically just an accurate greeting. (Laughter)So okay, determining whether or not something is abusive without context, definitely hard.Let's look at spam. Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior, sending the exact same message to thousands of people. While this is a mockup I put together using my account, we see accounts doing this all the time. Seems pretty straightforward. We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior. Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule. Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it. You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam.Okay. Let's make the stakes higher. Back to my account, again exhibiting classic behavior. This time it's sending the same message and link. This is often indicative of  something called phishing, somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website. That's pretty clearly not a good thing. We want to, and do, suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior. So why are the stakes higher for this? Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non-violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening. We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it. That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors, and even then, we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate.Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against, it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected. And that's not just an issue for me, or for Twitter, it's an issue for you. It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things. So what do I do? I pause and I think, how could all of this go horribly wrong? I visualize catastrophe. And that's hard. There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that, like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement. (Laughter) But you still have to do it, particularly if you're marrying  500 million tweets per day. What do I mean by \"visualize catastrophe?\" I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death, and what to do to prevent that. Which happens to be my next example. This is my cat, Eli. We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets. A picture is worth a thousand words. You only get 140 characters. You add a photo to your tweet, look at how much more content you've got now. There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet. My job isn't to think of those. It's to think of what could go wrong.How could this picture lead to my death? Well, here's one possibility. There's more in that picture than just a cat. There's geodata. When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera, there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image. In fact, this image also contains the equivalent of this, more specifically, this. Sure, it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat, but I start by assuming the worst will happen. That's why, when we launched photos on Twitter, we made the decision to strip that geodata out. (Applause) If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards, I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases.Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen, it wouldn't be surprising if  my worldview was gloomy. (Laughter) It's not. The vast majority of interactions I see \u2014 and I see a lot, believe me \u2014 are positive, people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other. It's just that for those of us dealing with scale, for those of us tasked with keeping people safe, we have to assume the worst will happen, because for us, a one-in-a-million chance is pretty good odds.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1958, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:14.233\nMy job at Twitter\n\n00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.211\nis

--> 00:01:50.242\npose no risk to anyone.\n\n00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:51.308\nThere's no threat involved.\n\n00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:54.262\nMaybe people are documenting travel landmarks\n\n00:01:54.262 --> 00:01:56.225\nlike Australia's Heart Reef,\n\n00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:59.146\nor tweeting about a concert they're attending,\n\n00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:03.893\nor sharing pictures of cute baby animals.\n\n00:02:03.893 --> 00:02:08.402\nAfter you take out that 99.999 percent,\n\n00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:11.931\nthat tiny percentage of tweets remaining\n\n00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.320\nworks out to roughly\n\n00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.795\n150,000 per month.\n\n00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:20.251\nThe sheer scale of what we're dealing with\n\n00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.563\nmakes for a

risk involved,\n\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.608\noften without much in terms of context\n\n00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:42.455\nor background.\n\n00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:44.532\nI'm going to show you some

00:02:55.980\nThe details have been changed\n\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.237\nto protect the innocent\n\n00:02:57.237 --> 00:03:00.470\nand sometimes the guilty.\n\n00:03:00.470 -->

00:03:17.168\n\"Yo, bitch.\"\n\n00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:21.831\nNow, I try to stay relatively hip\n\n00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:24.343\nto the latest trends and memes,\n\n00:03:24.343 --> 00:03:27.047\nso I knew that \"yo, bitch\"\n\n00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:30.201\nwas also often a common greeting between friends,\n\n00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:34.463\nas well as being a popular \"Breaking Bad\"

also used on Twitter\n\n00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:45.957\nwhen people are role-playing as dogs.\n\n00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:51.236\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:52.902\nAnd in fact, in that

From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials, to computational methods that emulate neural processes, nature is driving design. Design is also driving nature. In realms of genetics, regenerative medicine and synthetic biology, designers are growing novel technologies, not foreseen or anticipated by nature.Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design. As you can see, my legs are bionic. Today, I will tell human stories of bionic integration; how electromechanics attached to the body, and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability, between human limitation and human potential.Bionics has defined my physicality. In 1982, both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite, incurred during a mountain-climbing accident. At that time, I didn't view my body as broken. I reasoned that a human being can never be \"broken.\" Technology is broken. Technology is inadequate. This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms, to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability, and ultimately, the disability of others. I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing. I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable; able to take on any form, any function \u2014 a blank slate for which to create, perhaps, structures that could extend beyond biological capability. I made my height adjustable. I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like.(Laughter)So when I was feeling bad about myself, insecure, I would jack my height up.(Laughter)But when I was feeling confident and suave, I would knock my height down a notch, just to give the competition a chance.(Laughter)(Applause)Narrow-edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures, where the human foot cannot penetrate, and spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls, without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue. Through technological innovation, I returned to my sport, stronger and better. Technology had eliminated my disability, and allowed me a new climbing prowess. As a young man, I imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability, a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see. A world in which the paralyzed could walk, via body exoskeletons.Sadly, because of deficiencies in technology, disability is rampant in the world. This gentleman is missing three limbs. As a testimony to current technology, he is out of the wheelchair, but we need to do a better job in bionics, to allow, one day, full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury. At the MIT Media Lab, we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics. The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans, across a broad range of brain and body disabilities.Today, I'm going to tell you how my legs function, how they work, as a case in point for this center. Now, I made sure to shave my legs last night, because I knew I'd be showing them off.(Laughter)Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces. There's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs: mechanical, how my limbs are attached to my biological body; dynamic, how they move like flesh and bone; and electrical, how they communicate with my nervous system.I'll begin with mechanical interface. In the area of design, we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically. It's extraordinary to me that in this day and age, one of the most mature, oldest technologies in the human timeline, the shoe, still gives us blisters. How can this be? We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies. This is the beautifully lyrical design work of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab, showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances, shown here by color variation in this 3D-printed model. Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it, when you need it, for optimal support and flexibility, without ever causing discomfort.My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations, that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics. To achieve that mirroring, we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb. To that end, we used imaging tools such as MRI, to look inside my body, to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues. We also took robotic tools \u2014 here's a 14-actuator circle that goes around the biological limb. The actuators come in, find the surface of the limb, measure its unloaded shape, and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point.We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my biological limb, shown on the left. You see a bunch of points, or nodes? At each node, there's a color that represents tissue compliance. We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin, shown on the right. And we've discovered optimality is: where the body is stiff, the synthetic skin should be soft, where the body is soft, the synthetic skin is stiff, and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances. With this framework, we've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn. Clearly, in the future, our clothing, our shoes, our braces, our prostheses, will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies, but rather, data-driven quantitative frameworks. In that future, our shoes will no longer give us blisters.We're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins. This is a material developed by SRI International, California. Under electrostatic effect, it changes stiffness. So under zero voltage, the material is compliant, it's floppy like paper. Then the button's pushed, a voltage is applied, and it becomes stiff as a board.(Tapping sounds)We embed this material into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body. When I walk here, it's no voltage. My interface is soft and compliant. The button's pushed, voltage is applied, and it stiffens, offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb.We're also building exoskeletons. This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle, to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation. In the future, we'll all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities, such as running.Next, dynamic interface. How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone? At my MIT lab, we study how humans with normal physiologies stand, walk and run. What are the muscles doing, and how are they controlled by the spinal cord? This basic science motivates what we build. We're building bionic ankles, knees and hips. We're building body parts from the ground up. The bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs. They've been fitted to nearly 1,000 patients, 400 of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers.How does it work?At heel strike, under computer control, the system controls stiffness, to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground. Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride, comparable to how muscles work in the calf region. This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients. So on the left, you see the bionic device worn by a lady, on the right, a passive device worn by the same lady, that fails to emulate normal muscle function, enabling her to do something everyone should be able to do: go up and down their steps at home. Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats. Here's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway. This is Steve Martin \u2014 not the comedian \u2014 who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan.We're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles, that wrap around the biological limb. This gentleman does not have any leg condition, any disability. He has a normal physiology, so these exoskeletons are applying muscle-like torques and powers, so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers. This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking. It significantly reduces metabolic cost. It's so profound in its augmentation, that when a normal, healthy person wears the device for 40 minutes and then takes it off, their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward. We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient.Moving on to electrical interface: How do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system? Across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles. That's communicated to the bionic limb, so when I think about moving my phantom limb, the robot tracks those movement desires. This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled. So we model the missing biological limb, and we've discovered what reflexes occurred, how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles. And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb. What we've done, then, is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex, the modeled spinal reflex, with the neural signal, so when I relax my muscles in my residual limb, I get very little torque and power, but the more I fire my muscles, the more torque I get, and I can even run. And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command. Feels great.(Applause)We want to go a step further. We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb. We're doing experiments where we're growing nerves, transected nerves, through channels, or micro-channel arrays. On the other side of the channel, the nerve then attaches to cells, skin cells and muscle cells. In the motor channels, we can sense how the person wishes to move. That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb, then [sensory information] on the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels, sensory channels. So when this is fully developed and for human use, persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone, but actually feel like flesh and bone.This video shows Lisa Mallette, shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs. Indeed, bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives.(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God. LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!(Video) (Laughter)LM: It's just like I've got a real leg!Woman: Now, don't start running.Man: Now turn around, and do the same thing walking up, but get on your heel to toe, like you would normally just walk on level ground. Try to walk right up the hill.LM: Oh my God.Man: Is it pushing you up?LM: Yes! I'm not even \u2014 I can't even describe it.Man: It's pushing you right up.Hugh Herr: Next week, I'm visiting the Center \u2014Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.Next week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and I'm going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate code language and pricing, so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)It's not well appreciated, but over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive, emotional, sensory or motor condition, and because of poor technology, too often, conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life. Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights. Every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose \u2014 the right to live life without severe depression; the right to see a loved one, in the case of seeing-impaired; or the right to walk or to dance, in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation. As a society, we can achieve these human rights, if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment, our technologies, are broken and disabled. We the people need not accept our limitations, but can transcend disability through technological innovation. Indeed, through fundamental advances in bionics in this century, we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience, and we will end disability.I'd like to finish up with one more story, a beautiful story. The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis. Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack. I met Adrianne when this photo was taken, at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.Adrianne breathes and lives dance. It is her expression. It is her art form. Naturally, when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack, she wanted to return to the dance floor.After meeting her and driving home in my car, I thought, I'm an MIT professor. I have resources. Let's build her a bionic limb, to enable her to go back to her life of dance. I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics, robotics, machine learning and biomechanics, and over a 200-day research period, we studied dance. We brought in dancers with biological limbs, and we studied how they move, what forces they apply on the dance floor, and we took those data, and we put forth fundamental principles of dance, reflexive dance capability, and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb. Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster. Our expression, our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics.It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack. In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor. In 200 days, we put her back. We will not be intimidated, brought down, diminished, conquered or stopped by acts of violence.(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis, her first performance since the attack. She's dancing with Christian Lightner.(Applause)(Music: \"Ring My Bell\" performed by Enrique Iglesias)(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, members of the research team: Elliott Rouse and Nathan

00:01:32.766\ndue to tissue damage from frostbite,\n\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.042\nincurred during\na mountain-climbing accident.\n\n00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.495\nAt that time, I didn't\nview my

00:01:50.700\nTechnology is inadequate.\n\n00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:56.054\nThis simple but powerful idea\nwas a call to arms,\n\n00:01:56.078 --> 00:02:00.585\nto advance technology\nfor the elimination of my own disability,\n\n00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.101\nand ultimately, the disability of others.\n\n00:02:04.418 --> 00:02:07.376\nI began by developing specialized limbs\n\n00:02:07.400

00:04:45.060\nI'll begin with mechanical interface.\n\n00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:49.005\nIn the area of design,\nwe still do not understand\n\n00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.905\nhow to attach devices\nto the

to our bodies.\n\n00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:11.227\nThis is the beautifully\nlyrical design work\n\n00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:13.672\nof Professor Neri Oxman\nat the MIT Media Lab,\n\n00:05:13.696 -->

causing discomfort.\n\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.492\nMy bionic limbs are attached\nto my biological body\n\n00:05:35.516 --> 00:05:39.578\nvia synthetic skins\nwith stiffness variations,\n\n00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:43.222\nthat mirror my underlying\ntissue biomechanics.\n\n00:05:44.317 --> 00:05:47.491\nTo achieve that mirroring, we first\ndeveloped a mathematical model\n\n00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:49.063\nof my biological limb.\n\n00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:52.369\nTo that end, we used\nimaging tools such as MRI,\n\n00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:53.957\nto look inside my body,\n\n00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:57.686\nto figure out the geometries\nand locations of various tissues.\n\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.097\nWe also took robotic tools --\n\n00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:04.032\nhere's a 14-actuator circle\nthat goes around the biological limb.\n\n00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.397\nThe actuators come in,\nfind the surface of the limb,\n\n00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:09.666\nmeasure its unloaded shape,\n\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.341\nand then they push on the tissues\n\n00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:14.936\nto measure tissue compliances\nat each anatomical point.\n\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.747\nWe combine these imaging and robotic data\n\n00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:21.413\nto build a mathematical description\nof my biological limb, shown on the left.\n\n00:06:21.437 --> 00:06:23.191\nYou see a bunch of points, or nodes?\n\n00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:26.365\nAt each node, there's a color\nthat represents tissue compliance.\n\n00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.331\nWe then do a mathematical transformation\nto the design of the synthetic skin,\n\n00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:31.554\nshown on the right.\n\n00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:34.450\nAnd we've discovered optimality is:\n\n00:06:34.474 --> 00:06:37.331\nwhere the body is stiff,\nthe synthetic skin should be soft,\n\n00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.815\nwhere the body is soft,\nthe synthetic skin is stiff,\n\n00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:44.122\nand this mirroring occurs\nacross all tissue compliances.\n\n00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:47.439\nWith this framework,\nwe've produced bionic limbs\n\n00:06:47.463 --> 00:06:50.384\nthat are the most comfortable\nlimbs I've ever worn.\n\n00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:57.124\nClearly, in the future, our clothing,\nour shoes, our braces, our

sounds)\n\n00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:36.272\nWe embed this material\ninto the synthetic skin\n\n00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:39.405\nthat attaches my bionic limb\nto my biological body.\n\n00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:42.276\nWhen I walk here, it's no voltage.\n\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.357\nMy interface is soft and compliant.\n\n00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.372\nThe button's pushed,\nvoltage is applied, and it stiffens,\n\n00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:50.412\noffering me a greater maneuverability\nover the bionic limb.\n\n00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:52.709\nWe're also building exoskeletons.\n\n00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:55.541\nThis exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft\n\n00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:58.503\nin just the right areas\nof the running cycle,\n\n00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:02.781\nto protect the biological joints\nfrom high impacts and degradation.\n\n00:08:02.805 --> 00:08:05.591\nIn the future, we'll all\nbe wearing exoskeletons\n\n00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:07.900\nin common activities, such as running.\n\n00:08:08.924 --> 00:08:10.408\nNext, dynamic interface.\n\n00:08:10.432 --> 00:08:12.940\nHow do my bionic limbs\nmove like flesh and bone?\n\n00:08:13.757 --> 00:08:17.742\nAt my MIT lab, we study how humans\nwith normal physiologies\n\n00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:19.272\nstand, walk and run.\n\n00:08:19.296 --> 00:08:20.687\nWhat are the muscles doing,\n\n00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.084\nand how are they controlled\nby the spinal cord?\n\n00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:26.100\nThis basic science\nmotivates what we build.\n\n00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:28.462\nWe're building bionic ankles,\nknees and hips.\n\n00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:31.002\nWe're building body parts\nfrom the ground up.\n\n00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:34.975\nThe bionic limbs that I'm wearing\nare called BiOMs.\n\n00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:38.953\nThey've been fitted\nto nearly 1,000 patients,\n\n00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.939\n400 of which have been\nwounded U.S. soldiers.\n\n00:08:41.963 --> 00:08:43.121\nHow does it work?\n\n00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:45.160\nAt heel strike, under computer control,\n\n00:08:45.184 --> 00:08:47.160\nthe system controls stiffness,\n\n00:08:47.184 --> 00:08:50.221\nto attenuate the shock\nof the limb hitting the ground.\n\n00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:54.341\nThen at mid-stance, the bionic limb\noutputs high torques and powers\n\n00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:56.720\nto lift the person\ninto the walking stride,\n\n00:08:56.744 --> 00:09:00.229\ncomparable to how muscles\nwork in the calf region.\n\n00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:04.784\nThis bionic propulsion is very important\nclinically to patients.\n\n00:09:04.808 --> 00:09:07.862\nSo on the left, you see\nthe bionic device worn by a lady,\n\n00:09:07.886 --> 00:09:10.821\non the right, a passive device\nworn by the same lady,\n\n00:09:10.845 --> 00:09:13.671\nthat fails to emulate\nnormal muscle function,\n\n00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:17.373\nenabling her to do something\neveryone should be able to do:\n\n00:09:17.397 --> 00:09:19.172\ngo up and down their steps at home.\n\n00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:22.607\nBionics also allows\nfor extraordinary athletic feats.\n\n00:09:23.107 --> 00:09:25.750\nHere's a gentleman running\nup a rocky pathway.\n\n00:09:27.742 --> 00:09:30.567\nThis is Steve Martin --\nnot the comedian --\n\n00:09:30.591 --> 00:09:33.570\nwho lost his legs in a bomb blast\nin Afghanistan.\n\n00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:39.152\nWe're also building exoskeletal\nstructures using these same principles,\n\n00:09:39.176 --> 00:09:41.419\nthat wrap around the biological limb.\n\n00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:47.480\nThis gentleman does not have\nany leg condition, any disability.\n\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.760\nHe has a normal physiology,\n\n00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:54.353\nso these exoskeletons are applying\nmuscle-like torques and powers,\n\n00:09:54.377 --> 00:09:58.077\nso that his own muscles need not\napply those torques and powers.\n\n00:09:59.037 --> 00:10:04.435\nThis is the first exoskeleton in history\nthat actually augments human walking.\n\n00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:07.264\nIt significantly reduces metabolic cost.\n\n00:10:07.626 --> 00:10:10.340\nIt's so profound in its augmentation,\n\n00:10:10.364 --> 00:10:13.513\nthat when a normal, healthy person\nwears the device for 40 minutes\n\n00:10:13.537 --> 00:10:15.236\nand then takes it off,\n\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.315\ntheir own biological legs feel\nridiculously heavy and awkward.\n\n00:10:19.997 --> 00:10:23.408\nWe're beginning the age in which\nmachines attached to our bodies\n\n00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:26.442\nwill make us stronger\nand faster and more efficient.\n\n00:10:27.657 --> 00:10:29.404\nMoving on to electrical interface:\n\n00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:32.585\nHow do my bionic limbs communicate\nwith my nervous system?\n\n00:10:32.609 --> 00:10:34.451\nAcross my residual limb are electrodes\n\n00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:37.220\nthat measure the electrical\npulse of my muscles.\n\n00:10:37.244 --> 00:10:39.163\nThat's communicated to the bionic limb,\n\n00:10:39.187 --> 00:10:42.240\nso when I think about moving\nmy phantom limb,\n\n00:10:42.264 --> 00:10:44.978\nthe robot tracks those movement desires.\n\n00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:50.220\nThis diagram shows fundamentally\nhow the bionic limb is controlled.\n\n00:10:50.628 --> 00:10:53.033\nSo we model the missing biological limb,\n\n00:10:53.057 --> 00:10:55.871\nand we've discovered\nwhat reflexes occurred,\n\n00:10:55.895 --> 00:10:59.236\nhow the reflexes of the spinal cord\nare controlling the muscles.\n\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.157\nAnd that capability is embedded\nin the chips of the bionic limb.\n\n00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:08.927\nWhat we've done, then, is we modulate\nthe sensitivity of the reflex,\n\n00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:12.046\nthe modeled spinal reflex,\nwith the neural signal,\n\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.499\nso when I relax my muscles\nin my residual limb,\n\n00:11:15.523 --> 00:11:18.370\nI get very little torque and power,\n\n00:11:18.394 --> 00:11:21.115\nbut the more I fire my muscles,\nthe more torque I get,\n\n00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.551\nand I can even run.\n\n00:11:23.972 --> 00:11:28.916\nAnd that was the first demonstration\nof a running gait under neural command.\n\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.092\nFeels great.\n\n00:11:30.116 --> 00:11:35.282\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:36.107 --> 00:11:37.492\nWe want to go a step further.\n\n00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:40.563\nWe want to actually close the loop\n\n00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:43.823\nbetween the human\nand the bionic external limb.\n\n00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:45.516\nWe're doing experiments\n\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.009\nwhere we're growing nerves,\ntransected nerves,\n\n00:11:48.033 --> 00:11:50.063\nthrough channels, or micro-channel arrays.\n\n00:11:50.087 --> 00:11:51.781\nOn the other side of the channel,\n\n00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:54.134\nthe nerve then attaches to cells,\n\n00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:56.066\nskin cells and muscle cells.\n\n00:11:56.884 --> 00:12:01.004\nIn the motor channels, we can sense\nhow the person wishes to move.\n\n00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:04.665\nThat can be sent out wirelessly\nto the bionic limb,\n\n00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:07.070\nthen [sensory information]\non the bionic limb\n\n00:12:07.095 --> 00:12:10.595\ncan be converted to stimulations\nin adjacent channels,\n\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.852\nsensory channels.\n\n00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:15.904\nSo when this is fully developed\nand for human use,\n\n00:12:15.928 --> 00:12:18.564\npersons like myself will not only have\n\n00:12:18.588 --> 00:12:22.121\nsynthetic limbs that move\nlike flesh and bone,\n\n00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:24.907\nbut actually feel like flesh and bone.\n\n00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:28.135\nThis video shows Lisa Mallette,\n\n00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:30.810\nshortly after being fitted\nwith two bionic limbs.\n\n00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:34.922\nIndeed, bionics is making\na profound difference in people's lives.\n\n00:12:34.946 --> 00:12:36.699\n(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.\n\n00:12:39.477 --> 00:12:42.612\nLM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!\n\n00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:44.079\n(Video) (Laughter)\n\n00:12:44.103 --> 00:12:47.052\nLM: It's just like I've got a real leg!\n\n00:12:49.195 --> 00:12:50.789\nWoman: Now, don't start running.\n\n00:12:50.813 --> 00:12:53.607\nMan: Now turn around,\nand do the same thing walking up,\n\n00:12:53.631 --> 00:12:57.360\nbut get on your heel to toe, like you\nwould normally just walk on level ground.\n\n00:12:57.384 --> 00:12:59.210\nTry to walk right up the hill.\n\n00:13:01.369 --> 00:13:03.472\nLM: Oh my God.\n\n00:13:03.995 --> 00:13:05.241\nMan: Is it pushing you up?\n\n00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:10.220\nLM: Yes! I'm not even --\nI can't even describe it.\n\n00:13:10.244 --> 00:13:11.757\nMan: It's pushing you right up.\n\n00:13:12.566 --> 00:13:15.114\nHugh Herr: Next week,\nI'm visiting the Center --\n\n00:13:15.138 --> 00:13:16.290\nThank you.

It is her art form.\n\n00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:20.617\nNaturally, when she lost her limb\nin the Boston terrorist attack,\n\n00:15:20.641 --> 00:15:22.808\nshe wanted to return to the dance floor.\n\n00:15:23.786 --> 00:15:25.945\nAfter meeting her\nand driving home in my car,\n\n00:15:25.969 --> 00:15:29.822\nI thought, I'm an MIT professor.\nI have resources.\n\n00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.384\nLet's build her a bionic limb,\n\n00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:34.338\nto enable her to go back\nto her life of dance.\n\n00:15:35.354 --> 00:15:38.830\nI brought in MIT scientists\nwith expertise in prosthetics,\n\n00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:41.163\nrobotics, machine learning\nand biomechanics,\n\n00:15:41.187 --> 00:15:45.022\nand over a 200-day research period,\nwe studied dance.\n\n00:15:45.347 --> 00:15:49.244\nWe brought in dancers\nwith biological limbs,\n\n00:15:49.268 --> 00:15:51.903\nand we studied how they move,\n\n00:15:51.927 --> 00:15:55.100\nwhat forces they apply on the dance floor,\n\n00:15:55.124 --> 00:15:56.651\nand we took those data,\n\n00:15:56.675 --> 00:16:00.450\nand we put forth\nfundamental principles of dance,\n\n00:16:00.474 --> 00:16:02.261\nreflexive dance capability,\n\n00:16:02.285 --> 00:16:05.450\nand we embedded that intelligence\ninto the bionic limb.\n\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.695\nBionics is not only about making\npeople stronger and faster.\n\n00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:15.131\nOur expression, our humanity\ncan be embedded into electromechanics.\n\n00:16:15.478 --> 00:16:21.254\nIt was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts\nin the Boston terrorist attack.\n\n00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:27.254\nIn 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards\ntook Adrianne off the dance floor.\n\n00:16:27.818 --> 00:16:29.984\nIn 200 days, we put her back.\n\n00:16:30.453 --> 00:16:35.426\nWe will not be intimidated, brought down,\ndiminished, conquered or stopped\n\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.995\nby acts of violence.\n\n00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:43.955\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:49.306\nLadies and gentlemen, please allow me\nto introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,\n\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.560\nher first performance since the attack.\n\n00:16:52.338 --> 00:16:54.475\nShe's dancing with Christian Lightner.\n\n00:16:54.499 --> 00:17:01.191\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:05.537 --> 00:17:11.652\n(Music: \"Ring My Bell\"\nperformed by Enrique Iglesias)\n\n00:17:51.225 --> 00:17:57.995\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:22.128 --> 00:18:24.896\nLadies and gentlemen,\nmembers of the research team:\n\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.915\nElliott Rouse\n\n00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:29.335\nand Nathan Villagaray-Carski.\n\n00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:32.121\nElliott and Nathan.\n\n00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:38.730\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why I must come out", "duration": "599", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/geena_rocero_why_i_must_come_out", "transcript": "The world makes you something that you're not, but you know inside what you are, and that question burns in your heart: How will you become that? I may be somewhat unique in this, but I am not alone, not alone at all. So when I became a fashion model, I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young child. My outside self finally matched my inner truth, my inner self. For complicated reasons which I'll get to later, when I look at this picture, at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it, you've made it, you have arrived. But this past October, I realized that I'm only just beginning. All of us are put in boxes by our family, by our religion, by our society, our moment in history, even our own bodies. Some people have the courage to break free, not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them. Those people are always the threat to the status quo, to what is considered acceptable.In my case, for the last nine years, some of my neighbors, some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent, did not know about my history. I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal. Here is mine.I was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia. I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house, I would always wear this t-shirt on my head. And my mom asked me, \"How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?\" I said, \"Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl.\" I knew then how to self-identify.Gender has always been considered a fact, immutable, but we now know it's actually more fluid, complex and mysterious. Because of my success, I never had the courage to share my story, not because I thought what I am is wrong, but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free. Every day, I am so grateful because I am a woman. I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am. Many are not so fortunate.There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender. There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion. There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess. So when I was eight years old, I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries. I was in front of the stage, and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me, and I remember that moment something hit me: That is the kind of woman I would like to be. So when I was 15 years old, still dressing as a boy, I met this woman named T.L. She is a transgender beauty pageant manager. That night she asked me, \"How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?\" She convinced me that if I joined that she would take care of the registration fee and the garments, and that night, I won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among 40-plus candidates. That moment changed my life. All of a sudden, I was introduced to the world of beauty pageants. Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women, but I'll take it.So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally, or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field, and when it rains \u2014 it rains a lot in the Philippines \u2014 the organizers would have to move it inside someone's house. I also experienced the goodness of strangers, especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the Philippines. But most importantly, I met some of my best friends in that community.In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that my green card petition came through, that I could now move to the United States. I resisted it. I told my mom, \"Mom, I'm having fun. I'm here with my friends, I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen.\" But then two weeks later she called me, she said, \"Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker?\" That was all I needed to hear. My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name. She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at 19 years old. It's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand, they perform some of the most prestigious, safe and sophisticated surgery. At that time in the United States, you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker. So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco, and I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Geena and gender marker F. That was a powerful moment. For some people, their I.D. is their license to drive or even to get a drink, but for me, that was my license to live, to feel dignified. All of a sudden, my fears were minimized. I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York and be a model.Many are not so fortunate. I think of this woman named Islan Nettles. She's from New York, she's a young woman who was courageously living her truth, but hatred ended her life. For most of my community, this is the reality in which we live. Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population. Every November 20, we have a global vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance. I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice. This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Today, this very moment, is my real coming out. I could no longer live my truth for and by myself. I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror. I am here, exposed, so that one day there will never be a need for a November 20 vigil.My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am. Will you?Thank you very much.(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you. I'm wondering what you would say, especially to parents, but in a more broad way, to friends, to family, to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them, what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them?Geena Rocero: Sure. Well, first, really, I'm so blessed. The support system, with my mom especially, and my family, that in itself is just so powerful. I remember every time I would coach young trans women, I would mentor them, and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't accept it, I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom, \"Mom, can you call this woman?\" And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so \u2014 But it's just, gender identity is in the core of our being, right? I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth, so what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match, and there should be a space that would allow people to self-identify, and that's a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues. The transgender movement, it's at the very beginning, to compare to how the gay movement started. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. There should be an understanding. There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions, and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.KS: Thank you. That was so lovely.

But if you keep looking further and further, eventually you see nothing for a long while, and then finally you see a faint, fading afterglow, and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.Now, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small, incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass, and from it sprung everything we see.Now, we've mapped that afterglow with great precision, and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me. We've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision, and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform. Fourteen billion light years that way and 14 billion light years that way, it's the same temperature. Now it's been 14 billion years since that Big Bang, and so it's got faint and cold. It's now 2.7 degrees. But it's not exactly 2.7 degrees. It's only 2.7 degrees to about 10 parts in a million. Over here, it's a little hotter, and over there, it's a little cooler, and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room, because where it was a little hotter, there was a little more stuff, and where there was a little more stuff, we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. And those small, little, inhomogeneities, 20 parts in a million, those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos.That is spectacular, and that's not what they found on Monday; what they found on Monday is cooler. So here's what they found on Monday: Imagine you take a bell, and you whack the bell with a hammer. What happens? It rings. But if you wait, that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don't notice it anymore. Now, that early universe was incredibly dense, like a metal, way denser, and if you hit it, it would ring, but the thing ringing would be the structure of space-time itself, and the hammer would be quantum mechanics. What they found on Monday was evidence of the ringing of the space-time of the early universe, what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era, and here's how they found it. Those waves have long since faded. If you go for a walk, you don't wiggle. Those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes. But early on, when the universe was making that last afterglow, the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see. So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper \u2014 in fact, these guys spent three years on the South Pole looking straight up through the coldest, clearest, cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol, the signal, of gravitational waves, the ringing of the early universe. And on Monday, they announced that they had found it.And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing, though that is awesome. The thing that's totally amazing, the reason I'm on this stage, is because what that tells us is something deep about the early universe. It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble \u2014 and this is the idea of inflation\u2014 one large bubble surrounded by something else. This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation, but anything that isn't inflation that explains this will look the same. This is a theory, an idea, that has been around for a while, and we never thought we we'd really see it. For good reasons, we thought we'd never see killer evidence, and this is killer evidence.But the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff. We're never going to see the stuff outside, but by going to the South Pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky, we can figure out that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that. And that amazes me.Thanks a lot.(Applause)", "id": 1963, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:16.378\nIf you look deep into the night sky,\n\n00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:17.994\nyou see stars,\n\n00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:20.566\nand if you look further, you see more stars,\n\n00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.725\nand further, galaxies, and \nfurther, more galaxies.\n\n00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:26.598\nBut if you keep looking further and further,\n\n00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.714\neventually you see nothing for a long while,\n\n00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:34.176\nand then finally you see a\nfaint, fading afterglow,\n\n00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:37.200\nand it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.\n\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.017\nNow, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe\n\n00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:42.188\nwhen everything we see in the night sky\n\n00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:44.598\nwas condensed into an incredibly small,\n\n00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:48.924\nincredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,\n\n00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.616\nand from it sprung everything we see.\n\n00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:54.475\nNow, we've mapped that afterglow\n\n00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:56.154\nwith great precision,\n\n00:00:56.154 --> 00:00:58.198\nand when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.\n\n00:00:58.198 --> 00:01:00.074\nWe've mapped the afterglow\n\n00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:01.396\nwith spectacular precision,\n\n00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:02.944\nand one of the shocks about it\n\n00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:05.890\nis that it's almost completely uniform.\n\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.848\nFourteen billion light years that way\n\n00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:09.708\nand 14 billion light years that way,\n\n00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.116\nit's the same temperature.\n\n00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:14.430\nNow it's been 14 billion years\n\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.248\nsince that Big Bang,\n\n00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:18.720\nand so it's got faint and cold.\n\n00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.028\nIt's now 2.7 degrees.\n\n00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:23.308\nBut it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.\n\n00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:25.602\nIt's only 2.7 degrees to about\n\n00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:27.444\n10 parts in a million.\n\n00:01:27.444 --> 00:01:28.438\nOver here, it's a little hotter,\n\n00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.306\nand over there, it's a little cooler,\n\n00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:33.394\nand that's incredibly important\nto everyone in this room,\n\n00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:35.118\nbecause where it was a little hotter,\n\n00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:36.814\nthere was a little more stuff,\n\n00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:38.381\nand where there was a little more stuff,\n\n00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:40.350\nwe have galaxies and clusters of galaxies\n\n00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.602\nand superclusters\n\n00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.310\nand all the structure you see in the cosmos.\n\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.422\nAnd those small, little, inhomogeneities,\n\n00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:49.704\n20 parts in a million,\n\n00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:52.458\nthose were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles\n\n00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.266\nin that early universe that were stretched\n\n00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.545\nacross the size of the entire cosmos.\n\n00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.259\nThat is spectacular,\n\n00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.924\nand that's not what they found on Monday;\n\n00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:01.960\nwhat they found on Monday is cooler.\n\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.226\nSo here's what they found on Monday:\n\n00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:07.729\nImagine you take a bell,\n\n00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.340\nand you whack the bell with a hammer.\n\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.016\nWhat happens?

On the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words, what I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they've done, and do a few things that way.So, we're going to start here. Melinda, when and where was this, and who is that handsome man next to you?Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh? This is in Africa, our very first trip, the first time either of us had ever been to Africa, in the fall of 1993. We were already engaged to be married. We married a few months later, and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna. It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time off from work. But what really touched us, actually, were the people, and the extreme poverty. We started asking ourselves questions. Does it have to be like this? And at the end of the trip, we went out to Zanzibar, and took some time to walk on the beach, which is something we had done a lot while we were dating. And we'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society, but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about, well, what might we do and how might we go about it?CA: So, given that this vacation led to the creation of the world's biggest private foundation, it's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.CA: Which of you was the key instigator here, or was it symmetrical? Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited that there'd be a phase of our life where we'd get to work together and figure out how to give this money back. At this stage, we were talking about the poorest, and could you have a big impact on them? Were there things that weren't being done? There was a lot we didn't know. Our na\u00efvet\u00e9 is pretty incredible, when we look back on it. But we had a certain enthusiasm that that would be the phase, the post-Microsoft phase would be our philanthropy.MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come after he was 60, so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet, so some things change along the way.CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated. So that was '93, and it was '97, really, before the foundation itself started.MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world, and we kept saying to ourselves, \"Well that can't be. In the U.S., you just go down to the drug store.\" And so we started gathering scientists and started learning about population, learning about vaccines, learning about what had worked and what had failed, and that's really when we got going, was in late 1998, 1999.CA: So, you've got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues. How on Earth do you decide what to focus on?BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes, whatever the biggest inequity was globally, and there we looked at children dying, children not having enough nutrition to ever develop, and countries that were really stuck, because with that level of death, and parents would have so many kids that they'd get huge population growth, and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn't be educated and lift themselves up. So that was our global thing, and then in the U.S., both of us have had amazing educations, and we saw that as the way that the U.S. could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system, and the more we learned, the more we realized we're not really fulfilling that promise. And so we picked those two things, and everything the foundation does is focused there.CA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work, and Melinda, this is what you picked. What's this about?MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women, whether it's Bangladesh, India, lots of countries in Africa, and I go in as a Western woman without a name. I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis. And I kept hearing from women, over and over and over, the more I traveled, \"I want to be able to use this shot.\" I would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines, and they would bring the conversation around to \"But what about the shot I get?\" which is an injection they were getting called Depo-Provera, which is a contraceptive. And I would come back and talk to global health experts, and they'd say, \"Oh no, contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world.\" Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports, and this is what the team came to me with, which is, to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than 200 days a year explains why women were saying to me, \"I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it, and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there.\" And so condoms were stocked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S. and others supported. But women will tell you over and over again, \"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband. I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS, and I need that tool because then I can space the births of my children, and I can feed them and have a chance of educating them.\"CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic, and you've often been embroiled in controversy over this issue, and on the abortion question, on both sides, really. How do you navigate that?MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point, which is, we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community. We knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives, even the contraceptives we have here in the United States, and we weren't providing them because of the political controversy in our country, and to me that was just a crime, and I kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage, and I finally realized I just had to do it. And even though I'm Catholic, I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives, and I shouldn't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back. We used to have consensus in the United States around contraceptives, and so we got back to that global consensus, and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars around exactly this issue for women. (Applause)CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it. (Laughter) I really like this graph. This is the number of children who die before the age of five every year. And what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely known, that we are making incredible progress. We go from 20 million not long after I was born to now we're down to about six million. So this is a story largely of vaccines. Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year. That was eradicated, so that got down to zero. Measles was killing a couple million a year. That's down to a few hundred thousand. Anyway, this is a chart where you want to get that number to continue, and it's going to be possible, using the science of new vaccines, getting the vaccines out to kids. We can actually accelerate the progress. The last decade, that number has dropped faster than ever in history, and so I just love the fact that you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines, we can get them out there, use the very latest understanding of these things, and get the delivery right, that we can perform a miracle.CA: I mean, you do the math on this, and it works out, I think, literally to thousands of kids' lives saved every day compared to the prior year. It's not reported. An airliner with 200-plus deaths is a far, far bigger story than that. Does that drive you crazy?BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on. It's a kid, one kid at a time. Ninety-eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters, and yet, people's charity, when they see a natural disaster, are wonderful. It's incredible how people think, okay, that could be me, and the money flows. These causes have been a bit invisible. Now that the Millennium Development Goals and various things are getting out there, we are seeing some increased generosity, so the goal is to get this well below a million, which should be possible in our lifetime.CA: Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big, sad face to get engaged. I mean, you've used it in your letter this year, you used basically this argument to say that aid, contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken, that actually it has been effective.BG: Yeah, well people can take, there is some aid that was well-meaning and didn't go well. There's some venture capital investments that were well-meaning and didn't go well. You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that, because we don't have a perfect record, this is a bad endeavor. You should look at, what was your goal? How are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves, and say wow, this is going well, and be smarter. We can spend aid smarter. It is not all a panacea. We can do better than venture capital, I think, including big hits like this.CA: Traditional wisdom is that it's pretty hard for married couples to work together. How have you guys managed it? MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me, \"I really don't think I could work with my husband. That just wouldn't work out.\" You know, we enjoy it, and we don't \u2014 this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey, and we don't travel together as much for the foundation, actually, as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. We have more trips where we're traveling separately, but I always know when I come home, Bill's going to be interested in what I learned, whether it's about women or girls or something new about the vaccine delivery chain, or this person that is a great leader. He's going to listen and be really interested. And he knows when he comes home, even if it's to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he's learned, I'm really interested, and I think we have a really collaborative relationship. But we don't every minute together, that's for sure. (Laughter)CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are. Melinda, early on, you were basically largely running the show. Six years ago, I guess, Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft and became full time. That must have been hard, adjusting to that. No?MG: Yeah. I think actually, for the foundation employees, there was way more angst for them than there was for me about Bill coming. I was actually really excited. I mean, Bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in 2006, and it was really his decision, but again, it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea. And for me, the excitement of Bill putting his brain and his heart against these huge global problems, these inequities, to me that was exciting. Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that. (Applause)CA: That's cool.MG: But that went away within three months, once he was there.BG: Including some of the employees.MG: That's what I said, the employees, it went away for them three months after you were there.BG: No, I'm kidding. MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.BG: A few of them did, but \u2014 (Laughter)CA: So what do you guys argue about? Sunday, 11 o'clock, you're away from work, what comes up? What's the argument?BG: Because we built this thing together from the beginning, it's this great partnership. I had that with Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft. I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger, and now Melinda, and in even stronger, equal ways, is the partner, so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to, which groups are working well? She's got a lot of insight. She'll sit down with the employees a lot. We'll take the different trips she described. So there's a lot of collaboration. I can't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another?CA: How about you, Melinda,  though? Can you? (Laughter) You never know.MG: Well, here's the thing. We come at things from different angles, and I actually think that's really good. So Bill can look at the big data and say, \"I want to act based on these global statistics.\" For me, I come at it from intuition. I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match, and I think what I've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand, can you actually deliver that vaccine? Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her child's mouth? Because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science. So I think it's been more a coming to over time towards each other's point of view, and quite frankly, the work is better because of it.CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth, you've had some amazing successes. What about failure, though? Can you talk about a failure and maybe what you've learned from it?BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures, because we've certainly had them. We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you're going to have different failures. Like, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity was asking for a better condom. Well, we got hundreds of ideas. Maybe a few of those will work out. We were very na\u00efve, certainly I was, about a drug for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis, that I thought, once I got this drug, we can just go wipe out the disease. Well, turns out it took an injection every day for 10 days. It took three more years to get it than we expected, and then there was no way it was going to get out there. Fortunately, we found out that if you go kill the sand flies, you probably can have success there, but we spent five years, you could say wasted five years, and about 60 million, on a path that turned out to have very modest benefit when we got there.CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year in education, I think, something like that. Is anything, the story of what's gone right there is quite a long and complex one. Are there any failures that you can talk about?MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer, and small schools definitely help. They bring down the dropout rate. They have less violence and crime in those schools. But the thing that we learned from that work, and what turned out to be the fundamental key, is a great teacher in front of the classroom. If you don't have an effective teacher in the front of the classroom, I don't care how big or small the building is, you're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ready for college. (Applause)CA: So Melinda, this is you and your eldest daughter, Jenn. And just taken about three weeks ago, I think, three or four weeks ago. Where was this?MG: So we went to Tanzania. Jenn's been to Tanzania. All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually. And we did something very different, which is, we decided to go spend two nights and three days with a family. Anna and Sanare are the parents. They invited us to come and stay in their boma. Actually, the goats had been there, I think, living in that particular little hut on their little compound before we got there. And we stayed with their family, and we really, really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania. And the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound, and so let me just give you one explanation of that. They had six children, and as I talked to Anna in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day, and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children. It was a very loving relationship. This was a Maasai warrior and his wife, but they had decided to get married, they clearly had respect and love in the relationship. Their children, their six children, the two in the middle were twins, 13, a boy, and a girl named Grace. And when we'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do, Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent, but she wasn't an adult. She was very, very shy. So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn. We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy. And at night, though, when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania, and there was no moon that night, the first night, and no stars, and Jenn came out of our hut with her REI little headlamp on, Grace went immediately, and got the translator, came straight up to my Jenn and said, \"When you go home, can I have your headlamp so I can study at night?\"CA: Oh, wow.MG: And her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son, who had passed his secondary exams, because of her chores, she'd not done so well and wasn't in the government school yet. He said, \"I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education. I can't pay for private school, and she may end up on this farm like my wife.\" So they know the difference that an education can make in a huge, profound way.CA: I mean, this is another pic of your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe, along with Paul Farmer. Bringing up three children when you're the world's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art. How have you managed it? What's been your approach?BG: Well, I'd say overall the kids get a great education, but you've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they're going to go and do, and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them \u2014 most of the money's going to the foundation \u2014 and help them find something they're excited about. We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing. And so far, they're fairly diligent, excited to pick their own direction.CA: You've obviously guarded their  privacy carefully for obvious reasons. I'm curious why you've given me permission to show this picture now here at TED. MG: Well, it's interesting. As they get older, they so know that our family belief is about responsibility, that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the United States and have a great education, and we have a responsibility to give back to the world. And so as they get older and we are teaching them \u2014 they have been to so many countries around the world \u2014 they're saying, we do want people to know that we believe in what you're doing, Mom and Dad, and it is okay to show us more. So we have their permission to show this picture, and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it eventually in some of his work. But they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation, too.CA: You've easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires. Is that your plan for them?BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that. They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important. We read an article long, actually, before we got married, where Warren Buffett talked about that, and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor either to society or to the kids.CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett, something really amazing happened in 2006, when somehow your only real rival for richest person in America suddenly turned around and agreed to give 80 percent of his fortune to your foundation. How on Earth did that happen? I guess there's a long version and a short version of that. We've got time for the short version.BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend, and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away. Tragically, she passed away before he did, and he's big on delegation, and \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 he said \u2014CA: Tweet that.BG: If he's got somebody who is doing something well, and is willing to do it at no charge, maybe that's okay. But we were stunned. MG: Totally stunned. BG: We had never expected it, and it has been unbelievable. It's allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically. Half the resources we have come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.CA: And I think you've pledged that by the time you're done, more than, or 95 percent of your wealth, will be given to the foundation.BG: Yes.CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing\u2014 (Applause) And recently, you and Warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give, what, more than half of their assets for philanthropy. How is that going? BG: Well, we've got about 120 people who have now taken this giving pledge. The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about, okay, do you hire staff, what do you give to them? We're not trying to homogenize it. I mean, the beauty of philanthropy is this mind-blowing diversity. People give to some things. We look and go, \"Wow.\" But that's great. That's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches, including even in one space, like education. We need more experimentation. But it's been wonderful, meeting those people, sharing their journey to philanthropy, how they involve their kids, where they're doing it differently, and it's been way more successful than we expected. Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size in the years ahead.MG: And having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy, I mean, these are people who have created their own businesses, put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas. If they put their ideas and their brain behind philanthropy, they can change the world. And they start to see others doing it, and saying, \"Wow, I want to do that with my own money.\" To me, that's the piece that's incredible.CA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard for some people to figure out even how to remotely spend that much money on something else. There are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people. I'm curious, can you make the pitch? What's the pitch?BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing we've ever done, and you can't take it with you, and if it's not good for your kids, let's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done. The world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the past, and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest, is the envy of the world. And part of the reason I'm so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government's not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction.CA: The world's got this terrible inequality, growing inequality problem that seems structural. It does seem to me that if more of your peers took the approach that you two have made, it would make a dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem. Is that a fair comment?BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy, it's good. It tries to balance out, and that's just.MG: But you change systems. In the U.S., we're trying to change the education system so it's just for everybody and it works for all students. That, to me, really changes the inequality balance.BG: That's the most important. (Applause)CA: Well, I really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the spectacular degree to which you have shaped the future. Thank you so much for coming to TED and for sharing with us and for all you do.BG: Thank you. MG: Thank you. (Applause)BG: Thank you. MG: Thank you very much. BG: All right, good job.

You could go online, you could look at pages, and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech-savvy for the time. And with the rise of social media and social networks in the early 2000s, the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of content we interact with is put up by average users, either in YouTube videos or blog posts or product reviews or social media postings. And it's also become a much more interactive place, where people are interacting with others, they're commenting, they're sharing, they're not just reading.So Facebook is not the only place you can do this, but it's the biggest, and it serves to illustrate the numbers. Facebook has 1.2 billion users per month. So half the Earth's Internet population is using Facebook. They are a site, along with others, that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill, and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online. So the result is that we have behavioral, preference, demographic data for hundreds of millions of people, which is unprecedented in history. And as a computer scientist,  what this means is that I've been able to build models that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes for all of you that you don't even know you're sharing information about. As scientists, we use that to help the way people interact online, but there's less altruistic applications, and there's a problem in that users don't really understand these techniques and how they work, and even if they did, they don't have a lot of control over it. So what I want to talk to you about today is some of these things that we're able to do, and then give us some ideas of how we might go forward to move some control back into the hands of users.So this is Target, the company. I didn't just put that logo on this poor, pregnant woman's belly. You may have seen this anecdote that was printed in Forbes magazine where Target sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant. Yeah, the dad was really upset. He said, \"How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents?\" It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they  call a pregnancy score, which is not just whether or  not a woman's pregnant, but what her due date is. And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things, like, she's buying a crib or baby clothes, but things like, she bought more vitamins than she normally had, or she bought a handbag that's big enough to hold diapers. And by themselves, those purchases don't seem like they might reveal a lot, but it's a pattern of behavior that, when you take it in the context  of thousands of other people, starts to actually reveal some insights. So that's the kind of thing that we do when we're predicting stuff about you on social media. We're looking for little patterns of behavior that, when you detect them among millions of people, lets us find out all kinds of things.So in my lab and with colleagues, we've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference, your personality score, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, intelligence, along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are. We can do all of this really well. And again, it doesn't come from what you might think of as obvious information.So my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academies. If you Google this, you'll find it. It's four pages, easy to read. And they looked at just people's Facebook likes, so just the things you like on Facebook, and used that to predict all these attributes, along with some other ones. And in their paper they listed the five likes that were most indicative of high intelligence. And among those was liking a page for curly fries. (Laughter) Curly fries are delicious, but liking them does not necessarily mean that you're smarter than the average person. So how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that's being predicted? And it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we're able to do this. One of them is a sociological theory called homophily, which basically says people are friends with people like them. So if you're smart, you tend to be friends with smart people, and if you're young, you tend to be friends with young people, and this is well established for hundreds of years. We also know a lot about how information spreads through networks. It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks. So this is something we've studied for a long time. We have good models of it. And so you can put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen. So if I were to give you a hypothesis, it would be that a smart guy started this page, or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test. And they liked it, and their friends saw it, and by homophily, we know that he probably had smart friends, and so it spread to them,  and some of them liked it, and they had smart friends, and so it spread to them, and so it propagated through the network to a host of smart people, so that by the end, the action of liking the curly fries page is indicative of high intelligence, not because of the content, but because the actual action of liking reflects back the common attributes of other people who have done it.So this is pretty complicated stuff, right? It's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user, and even if you do, what can the average user do about it? How do you know that  you've liked something that indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked? There's a lot of power that users don't have to control how this data is used. And I see that as a real  problem going forward.So I think there's a couple paths that we want to look at if we want to give users some control over how this data is used, because it's not always going to be used for their benefit. An example I often give is that, if I ever get bored being a professor, I'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you're a drug user, if you're an alcoholic. We know how to predict all that. And I'm going to sell reports to H.R. companies and big businesses that want to hire you. We totally can do that now. I could start that business tomorrow, and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that. That seems to me to be a problem.So one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path. And in some respects, I think that that would be most effective, but the problem is we'd actually have to do it. Observing our political process in action makes me think it's highly unlikely that we're going to get a bunch of representatives to sit down, learn about this, and then enact sweeping changes to intellectual property law in the U.S. so users control their data.We could go the policy route, where social media companies say, you know what? You own your data. You have total control over how it's used. The problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting  users' data in some way. It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the customer, they're the product. And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users? It's possible, but I don't think it's something that we're going to see change quickly.So I think the other path that we can go down that's going to be more effective is one of more science. It's doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place. And it's actually very similar research that we'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user, \"Here's the risk of that action you just took.\" By liking that Facebook page, or by sharing this piece of personal information, you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace. And that, I think, can affect whether or not people want to share something, keep it private, or just keep it offline altogether. We can also look at things like allowing people to encrypt data that they upload, so it's kind of invisible and worthless to sites like Facebook or third party services that access it, but that select users who the person who posted it want to see it have access to see it. This is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective, and so scientists are going to be willing to do it. So that gives us an advantage over the law side.One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is, they say, you know, if people start keeping all this data private, all those methods that you've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail. And I say, absolutely, and for me, that's success, because as a scientist, my goal is not to infer information about users, it's to improve the way people interact online. And sometimes that involves inferring things about them, but if users don't want me to use that data, I think they should have the right to do that. I want users to be informed and consenting users of the tools that we develop.And so I think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward, as these tools evolve and advance, means that we're going to have an educated and empowered user base, and I think all of us can agree that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1957, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:14.693\nIf you

00:04:24.130\nis liking this page\n\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.382\nwhen the content is totally irrelevant\n\n00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:28.909\nto the attribute that's being predicted?\n\n00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.493\nAnd it turns out that we have to look at\n\n00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:32.111\na whole bunch of underlying theories\n\n00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.680\nto see why we're able to do this.\n\n00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.593\nOne of them is a sociological\ntheory called homophily,\n\n00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:40.685\nwhich basically says people are\nfriends with people like them.\n\n00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:42.699\nSo if you're smart, you tend to\nbe friends with smart people,\n\n00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.329\nand if you're young, you tend\nto be friends with young people,\n\n00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:46.956\nand this is well established\n\n00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:48.701\nfor hundreds of years.\n\n00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:49.933\nWe also know a lot\n\n00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:52.483\nabout how information spreads through networks.\n\n00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:54.237\nIt turns out things like viral videos\n\n00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:56.643\nor Facebook likes or other information\n\n00:04:56.643 --> 00:04:58.531\nspreads in exactly the same way\n\n00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.985\nthat diseases spread through social networks.\n\n00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:02.776\nSo this is something we've studied for a long time.\n\n00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:04.352\nWe have good models of it.\n\n00:05:04.352 --> 00:05:06.509\nAnd so you can put those things together\n\n00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.597\nand start seeing why things like this happen.\n\n00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:11.411\nSo if I were to give you a hypothesis,\n\n00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.638\nit would be that a smart guy started this page,\n\n00:05:14.638 --> 00:05:16.577\nor maybe one of the first people who liked it\n\n00:05:16.577 --> 00:05:18.313\nwould have scored high on that test.\n\n00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:20.601\nAnd they liked it, and their friends saw it,\n\n00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.723\nand by homophily, we know that\nhe probably had smart friends,\n\n00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:26.779\nand so it spread to them, \nand some of them liked it,\n\n00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:27.968\nand they had smart friends,\n\n00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:28.775\nand so it spread to them,\n\n00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.748\nand so it propagated through the network\n\n00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:33.317\nto a host of smart people,\n\n00:05:33.317 --> 00:05:35.373\nso that by the end, the action\n\n00:05:35.373 --> 00:05:37.917\nof liking the curly fries page\n\n00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:39.532\nis indicative of high intelligence,\n\n00:05:39.532 --> 00:05:41.335\nnot because of the content,\n\n00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:43.857\nbut because the actual action of liking\n\n00:05:43.857 --> 00:05:45.757\nreflects back the common attributes\n\n00:05:45.757 --> 00:05:48.225\nof other people who have done it.\n\n00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:51.122\nSo this is pretty complicated stuff, right?\n\n00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:53.321\nIt's a hard thing to sit down and explain\n\n00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:56.169\nto an average user, and even if you do,\n\n00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.357\nwhat can the average user do about it?\n\n00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.405\nHow do you know that \nyou've liked something\n\n00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:01.897\nthat indicates a trait for you\n\n00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:05.442\nthat's totally irrelevant to the\ncontent of what you've liked?\n\n00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:07.988\nThere's a lot of power that users don't have\n\n00:06:07.988 --> 00:06:10.218\nto control how this data is used.\n\n00:06:10.218 --> 00:06:13.330\nAnd I see that as a real \nproblem going forward.\n\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.307\nSo I think there's a couple paths\n\n00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:16.308\nthat we want to look at\n\n00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:18.218\nif we want to give users some control\n\n00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:19.958\nover how this data is used,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.898\nbecause it's not always going to be used\n\n00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:23.279\nfor their benefit.\n\n00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.701\nAn example I often give is that,\n\n00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:26.347\nif I ever get bored being a professor,\n\n00:06:26.347 --> 00:06:28.000\nI'm going to go start a company\n\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.454\nthat predicts all of these attributes\n\n00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:31.056\nand things like how well you work in teams\n\n00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:33.727\nand if you're a drug user, if you're an alcoholic.\n\n00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.167\nWe know how to predict all that.\n\n00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:36.928\nAnd I'm going to sell reports\n\n00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:39.028\nto H.R. companies and big businesses\n\n00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:41.301\nthat want to hire you.\n\n00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.478\nWe totally can do that now.\n\n00:06:42.478 --> 00:06:44.266\nI could start that business tomorrow,\n\n00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:46.318\nand you would have\nabsolutely no control\n\n00:06:46.318 --> 00:06:48.456\nover me using your data like that.\n\n00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:50.748\nThat seems to me to be a problem.\n\n00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:52.658\nSo one of the paths we can go down\n\n00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:54.690\nis the policy and law path.\n\n00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.736\nAnd in some respects, I think\nthat that would be most effective,\n\n00:06:57.736 --> 00:07:00.492\nbut the problem is we'd\nactually have to do it.\n\n00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:03.272\nObserving our political process in action\n\n00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:05.651\nmakes me think it's highly unlikely\n\n00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:07.248\nthat we're going to get a bunch of representatives\n\n00:07:07.248 --> 00:07:09.234\nto sit down, learn about this,\n\n00:07:09.234 --> 00:07:11.340\nand then enact sweeping changes\n\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.497\nto intellectual property law in the U.S.\n\n00:07:13.497 --> 00:07:15.958\nso users control their data.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.262\nWe could go the policy route,\n\n00:07:17.262 --> 00:07:18.741\nwhere social media companies say,\n\n00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:20.143\nyou know what? You own your data.\n\n00:07:20.143 --> 00:07:22.632\nYou have total control over how it's used.\n\n00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:24.480\nThe problem is that the revenue models\n\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.204\nfor most social media companies\n\n00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:30.235\nrely on sharing or exploiting \nusers' data in some way.\n\n00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:32.068\nIt's sometimes said of Facebook that the users\n\n00:07:32.068 --> 00:07:34.596\naren't the customer, they're the product.\n\n00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:37.310\nAnd so how do you get a company\n\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.868\nto cede control of their main asset\n\n00:07:39.868 --> 00:07:41.117\nback to the users?\n\n00:07:41.117 --> 00:07:42.818\nIt's possible, but I don't think it's something\n\n00:07:42.818 --> 00:07:45.138\nthat we're going to see change quickly.\n\n00:07:45.138 --> 00:07:46.638\nSo I think the other path\n\n00:07:46.638 --> 00:07:48.926\nthat we can go down that's\ngoing to be more effective\n\n00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:50.434\nis one of more science.\n\n00:07:50.434 --> 00:07:52.944\nIt's doing science that allowed us to develop\n\n00:07:52.944 --> 00:07:54.694\nall these mechanisms for computing\n\n00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:56.746\nthis personal data in the first place.\n\n00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.852\nAnd it's actually very similar research\n\n00:07:58.852 --> 00:08:00.290\nthat we'd have to do\n\n00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.676\nif we want to develop mechanisms\n\n00:08:02.676 --> 00:08:04.097\nthat can say to a user,\n\n00:08:04.097 --> 00:08:06.326\n\"Here's the risk of that action you just took.\"\n\n00:08:06.326 --> 00:08:08.406\nBy liking that Facebook page,\n\n00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:10.941\nor by sharing this piece of personal information,\n\n00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.443\nyou've now improved my ability\n\n00:08:12.443 --> 00:08:14.529\nto predict whether or not you're using drugs\n\n00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:17.391\nor whether or not you get\nalong well in the workplace.\n\n00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:19.239\nAnd that, I think, can affect whether or not\n\n00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:20.749\npeople want to share something,\n\n00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:23.988\nkeep it private, or just keep it offline altogether.\n\n00:08:23.988 --> 00:08:25.551\nWe can also look at things like\n\n00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.279\nallowing people to encrypt data that they upload,\n\n00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.134\nso it's kind of invisible and worthless\n\n00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:31.565\nto sites like Facebook\n\n00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:34.194\nor third party services that access it,\n\n00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:37.441\nbut that select users who the person who posted it\n\n00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:40.111\nwant to see it have access to see it.\n\n00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:42.277\nThis is all super exciting research\n\n00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:43.897\nfrom an intellectual perspective,\n\n00:08:43.897 --> 00:08:45.756\nand so scientists are going to be willing to do it.\n\n00:08:45.756 --> 00:08:49.366\nSo that gives us an advantage over the law side.\n\n00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:51.091\nOne of the problems that people bring up\n\n00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:52.686\nwhen I talk about this is, they say,\n\n00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:55.332\nyou know, if people start\nkeeping all this data private,\n\n00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:57.445\nall those methods that you've been developing\n\n00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:00.098\nto predict their traits are going to fail.\n\n00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:03.618\nAnd I say, absolutely, and for me, that's success,\n\n00:09:03.618 --> 00:09:05.404\nbecause as a scientist,\n\n00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:09.092\nmy goal is not to infer information about users,\n\n00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:11.859\nit's to improve the way people interact online.\n\n00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:15.077\nAnd sometimes that involves\ninferring things about them,\n\n00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:18.099\nbut if users don't want me to use that data,\n\n00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.137\nI think they should have the right to do that.\n\n00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:22.788\nI want users to be informed and consenting\n\n00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:24.900\nusers of the tools that we develop.\n\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.852\nAnd so I think encouraging this kind of science\n\n00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:29.198\nand supporting researchers\n\n00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:32.221\nwho want to cede some of that control back to users\n\n00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:34.532\nand away from the social media companies\n\n00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:37.203\nmeans that going forward, as these tools evolve\n\n00:09:37.203 --> 00:09:38.679\nand advance,\n\n00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.093\nmeans that we're going to have an educated\n\n00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:41.787\nand empowered user base,\n\n00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:42.887\nand I think all of us can agree\n\n00:09:42.887 --> 00:09:45.451\nthat that's a pretty ideal way to go forward.\n\n00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.635\nThank you.\n\n00:09:47.635 --> 00:09:50.715\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The unstoppable walk to political reform", "duration": "824", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_the_unstoppable_walk_to_political_reform", "transcript": "So a chip, a poet and a boy.It's just about 20 years ago, June 1994, when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip. Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions \u2014 I don't know what that means, but  it's what it says on Wikipedia \u2014 there was a flaw and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error, and the probability was one out of every 360 billion calculations. So Intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every 27,000 years. They didn't think it was significant, but there was an outrage in the community. The community, the techies, said, this flaw has to be addressed. They were not going to stand by quietly as Intel gave them these chips. So there was a revolution across the world. People marched to demand \u2014 okay, not really exactly like that \u2014 but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw. And Intel set aside 475 million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw. So billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every 360 billion calculations.Number two, a poet. This is Martin Niem\u00f6ller. You're familiar with his poetry. Around the height of the Nazi period, he started repeating the verse, \"First they came for the communists, and I did nothing, did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists. Then they came for the trade unions. Then they came for the Jews. And then they came for me. But there was no one left to speak for me.\" Now, Niem\u00f6ller is offering a certain kind of insight. This is an insight at the core of intelligence. We could call it cluefulness. It's a certain kind of test: Can you recognize an underlying threat and respond? Can you save yourself or save your kind? Turns out ants are pretty good at this. Cows, not so much. So can you see the pattern? Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it? Number two. Number three, a boy. This is my friend Aaron Swartz. He's Tim's friend. He's friends of many of you in this audience, and seven years ago, Aaron came to me with a question. It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk. I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk, \"Laws that choke creativity.\" And Aaron looked at me and was a little impatient, and he said, \"So how are you ever going to solve the problems you're talking about? Copyright policy, Internet policy, how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works?\"So I was a little put off by this. He wasn't sharing in my celebration. And I said to him, \"You know, Aaron, it's not my field, not my field.\"He said, \"You mean as an academic, it's not your field?\"I said, \"Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field.\"He said, \"What about as a citizen? As a citizen.\"Now, this is the way Aaron was. He didn't tell. He asked questions. But his questions spoke as clearly as my four-year-old's hug. He was saying to me, \"You've got to get a clue. You have got to get a clue, because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy, and it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times our democracy tries to make a decision. It is every time, every single important issue. We've got to end the bovinity of this political society. We've got to adopt, it turns out, the word is fourmi-formatic attitude \u2014 that's what the Internet tells me the word is \u2014 the ant's appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw, save our kind and save our demos.Now if you know Aaron Swartz, you know that we lost him just over a year ago. It was about six weeks before I gave my TED Talk, and I was so grateful to Chris that he asked me to give this TED Talk, not because I had the chance to talk to you, although that was great, but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression. I couldn't begin to describe the sadness. Because I had to focus. I had to focus on, what was I going to say to you? It saved me.But after the buzz, the excitement, the power that comes from this community, I began to yearn for a less sterile, less academic way to address these issues, the issues that I was talking about. We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire as a target for this political movement, because the primary in New Hampshire is so incredibly important. It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion that was beginning to talk about, how would we make this issue of this corruption central in 2016? But it was another soul that caught my imagination, a woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D. On January 1, 1999, 15 years ago, at the age of 88, Granny D started a walk. She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington, D.C. with a single sign on her chest that said, \"campaign finance reform.\" Eighteen months later, at the age of 90, she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her, including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her. (Laughter)Now, I don't have 13 months to walk across the country. I've got three kids who hate to walk, and a wife who, it turns out, still hates when I'm not there for mysterious reasons, so this was not an option, but the question I asked, could we remix Granny D a bit? What about a walk not of 3,200 miles but of 185 miles across New Hampshire in January?So on January 11, the anniversary of Aaron's death, we began a walk that ended on January 24th, the day that Granny D was born. A total of 200 people joined us across this walk, as we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire talking about this issue. And what was astonishing to me, something I completely did not expect to find, was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue. We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics. Now politicians and pundits tell you, there's nothing we can do about this issue, Americans don't care about it, but the reason for that is that 91 percent of Americans think there's nothing that can be done about this issue. And it's this gap between 96 and 91 that explains our politics of resignation. I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us wish we could fly like Superman, but because at least 91 percent of us believe we can't, we don't leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge. That's because we accept our limits, and so too with this reform. But when you give people the sense of hope, you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility. As Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope, you give 'em a chance, a way to think about how this change is possible. Hope. And hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends, failed him with, because we let him lose that sense of hope. I loved that boy like I love my son. But we failed him. And I love my country, and I'm not going to fail that. I'm not going to fail that. That sense of hope, we're going to hold, and we're going to fight for, however impossible this battle looks.What's next? Well, we started with this march with 200 people, and next year, there will be 1,000 on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause, and then in 2016, before the primary, there will be 10,000 who march across that state, meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause. And as we have marched, people around the country have begun to say, \"Can we do the same thing in our state?\" So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers, that is, Granny D walkers, and Granny D walkers across the country will be marching for this reform. Number one. Number two, on this march, one of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino, was with us, and he said, \"Well what can we do?\" And so they developed a platform, which we are announcing today, that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform. Regardless of where you are, in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire, you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is going to make this possibility real. And then finally number three, the hardest. We're in the age of the Super PAC. Indeed yesterday, Merriam announced that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word. It is now an official word in the dictionary. So on May 1, aka May Day, we're going to try an experiment. We're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a Super PAC to end all Super PACs. And the basic way this works is this. For the last year, we have been working with analysts and political experts to calculate, how much would it cost to win enough votes in the United States Congress to make fundamental reform possible? What is that number? Half a billion? A billion? What is that number? And then whatever that number is, we are going to kickstart, sort of, because you can't use KickStarter for political work, but anyway, kickstart, sort of, first a bottom-up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals, and when those goals have been reached, we will turn to the large dollar contributors, to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary to win this issue, to change the way money influences politics, so that on November 8, which I discovered yesterday is the day that Aaron would have been 30 years old, on November 8, we will celebrate 218 representatives in the House and 60 Senators in the United States Senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform.So last night, we heard about wishes. Here's my wish. May one. May the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people, we are the people who were promised a government, a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone, the people, who, as Madison told us, meant not the rich more than the poor. May one. And then may you, may you join this movement, not because you're a politician, not because you're an expert, not because this is your field, but because if you are, you are a citizen. Aaron asked me that. Now I've asked you.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1960, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:18.478\nSo a chip, a poet and a boy.\n\n00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:20.443\nIt's just about 20 years ago,\n\n00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:23.947\nJune 1994, when Intel announced\n\n00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:25.960\nthat there was a flaw\n\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.777\nat the core of their Pentium chip.\n\n00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:31.158\nDeep in the code of the SRT algorithm\n\n00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:33.409\nto calculate intermediate quotients necessary\n\n00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.243\nfor iterative floating points of divisions --\n\n00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.342\nI don't know what that means, but \nit's what it says on Wikipedia \u2014\n\n00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:41.221\nthere was a flaw and an error\n\n00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.437\nthat meant that there was a certain probability\n\n00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:46.445\nthat the result of the calculation would be an error,\n\n00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.038\nand the probability was one out of every\n\n00:00:49.038 --> 00:00:52.575\n360 billion calculations.\n\n00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:54.569\nSo Intel said your average spreadsheet\n\n00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.075\nwould be flawed once every 27,000 years.\n\n00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:00.369\nThey didn't think it was significant,\n\n00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.595\nbut there was an outrage in the community.\n\n00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:05.945\nThe community, the techies, said, this flaw\n\n00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.026\nhas to be addressed.\n\n00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:09.027\nThey were not going to stand by quietly\n\n00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.975\nas Intel gave them these chips.\n\n00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.021\nSo there was a revolution across the world.\n\n00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.051\nPeople marched to demand --\n\n00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.160\nokay, not really exactly like that \u2014\n\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.901\nbut they rose up and they demanded\n\n00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.893\nthat Intel fix the flaw.\n\n00:01:23.893 --> 00:01:29.745\nAnd Intel set aside 475 million dollars\n\n00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:31.987\nto fund the replacement of millions of chips\n\n00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:33.078\nto fix the flaw.\n\n00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:35.290\nSo billions of dollars in our society\n\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.474\nwas spent to address a problem\n\n00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:41.565\nwhich would come once out of every 360 billion\n\n00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:43.652\ncalculations.\n\n00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:46.255\nNumber two, a poet.\n\n00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.535\nThis is Martin Niem\u00f6ller.\n\n00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:50.068\nYou're familiar with his poetry.\n\n00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.844\nAround the height of the Nazi period,\n\n00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.116\nhe started repeating the verse,\n\n00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:55.851\n\"First they came for the communists,\n\n00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:57.382\nand I did nothing,\n\n00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.632\ndid not speak out because I was not a communist.\n\n00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:00.686\nThen they came for the socialists.\n\n00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.648\nThen they came for the trade unions.\n\n00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:03.894\nThen they came for the Jews.\n\n00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:06.796\nAnd then they came for me.\n\n00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:11.467\nBut there was no one left to speak for me.\"\n\n00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:14.596\nNow, Niem\u00f6ller is offering a certain kind of insight.\n\n00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:17.928\nThis is an insight at the core of intelligence.\n\n00:02:17.928 --> 00:02:20.642\nWe could call it cluefulness.\n\n00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:23.203\nIt's a certain kind of test:\n\n00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.995\nCan you recognize\n\n00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:27.499\nan underlying threat and respond?\n\n00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.989\nCan you save yourself or save your kind?\n\n00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.728\nTurns out ants are pretty good at this.\n\n00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:34.811\nCows, not so much.\n\n00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:37.241\nSo can you see the pattern?\n\n00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.588\nCan you see a pattern and then recognize\n\n00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:43.640\nand do something about it?

we remix Granny D a bit?\n\n00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:47.748\nWhat about a walk not of 3,200 miles\n\n00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:51.668\nbut of 185 miles across New Hampshire\n\n00:06:51.668 -->

among everyone\nthat we talked to about this issue.\n\n00:07:31.454 --> 00:07:36.560\nWe had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans\n\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.399\nbelieve it important to reduce the influence\n\n00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.645\nof money in politics.\n\n00:07:40.645 --> 00:07:42.661\nNow politicians and pundits tell you,\n\n00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:44.481\nthere's nothing we can do about this issue,\n\n00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:45.817\nAmericans don't care about it,\n\n00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:48.113\nbut the reason for that is\n\n00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:49.967\nthat 91 percent of Americans\n\n00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:54.489\nthink there's nothing that can\nbe done about this issue.\n\n00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:57.311\nAnd it's this gap between 96 and 91\n\n00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:59.788\nthat explains our politics of resignation.\n\n00:07:59.788 --> 00:08:01.871\nI mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us\n\n00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:03.733\nwish we could fly like Superman,\n\n00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.897\nbut because at least 91 percent\nof us believe we can't,\n\n00:08:06.897 --> 00:08:09.563\nwe don't leap off of tall buildings every time\n\n00:08:09.563 --> 00:08:10.873\nwe have that urge.\n\n00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:12.879\nThat's because we accept our limits,\n\n00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.638\nand so too with this reform.\n\n00:08:15.638 --> 00:08:19.931\nBut when you give people the sense of hope,\n\n00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:26.648\nyou begin to thaw that\nabsolute sense of impossibility.\n\n00:08:26.648 --> 00:08:30.263\nAs Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,\n\n00:08:30.263 --> 00:08:32.978\nyou give 'em a chance, a way to think\n\n00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:35.067\nabout how this change is possible.\n\n00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:37.918\nHope.\n\n00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:41.488\nAnd hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,\n\n00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:44.485\nfailed him with, because we let him\n\n00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:50.085\nlose that sense of hope.\n\n00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:54.037\nI loved that boy like I love my son.\n\n00:08:58.191 --> 00:09:02.160\nBut we failed him.\n\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.748\nAnd I love my country,\n\n00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:08.102\nand I'm not going to fail that.\n\n00:09:08.102 --> 00:09:09.274\nI'm not going to fail that.\n\n00:09:09.274 --> 00:09:12.967\nThat sense of hope, we're going to hold,\n\n00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:14.433\nand we're going to fight for,\n\n00:09:14.433 --> 00:09:19.133\nhowever impossible this battle looks.\n\n00:09:19.133 --> 00:09:20.427\nWhat's next?\n\n00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:23.588\nWell, we started with this march with 200 people,\n\n00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:26.990\nand next year, there will be 1,000\n\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.629\non different routes\n\n00:09:28.629 --> 00:09:31.139\nthat march in the month of January\n\n00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:34.967\nand meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,\n\n00:09:34.967 --> 00:09:37.527\nand then in 2016, before the primary,\n\n00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:40.488\nthere will be 10,000 who march across that state,\n\n00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:43.552\nmeeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.\n\n00:09:43.552 --> 00:09:46.323\nAnd as we have marched, people around the country\n\n00:09:46.323 --> 00:09:48.181\nhave begun to say, \"Can we do the same thing\n\n00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:49.298\nin our state?\"\n\n00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:51.677\nSo we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,\n\n00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:53.668\nthat is, Granny D walkers,\n\n00:09:53.668 --> 00:09:55.795\nand Granny D walkers across the country\n\n00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:58.897\nwill be marching for this reform. Number one.\n\n00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:01.177\nNumber two, on this march,\n\n00:10:01.177 --> 00:10:03.969\none of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,\n\n00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:05.588\nwas with us,\n\n00:10:05.588 --> 00:10:07.446\nand he said, \"Well what can we do?\"\n\n00:10:07.446 --> 00:10:09.775\nAnd so they developed a platform,\n\n00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.697\nwhich we are announcing today,\n\n00:10:11.697 --> 00:10:14.163\nthat allows us to pull together voters\n\n00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:16.841\nwho are committed to this idea of reform.\n\n00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:17.987\nRegardless of where you are,\n\n00:10:17.987 --> 00:10:20.639\nin New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,\n\n00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:22.549\nyou can sign up and directly be informed\n\n00:10:22.549 --> 00:10:25.537\nwhere the candidates are on this issue\n\n00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:27.177\nso you can decide who to vote for\n\n00:10:27.177 --> 00:10:30.095\nas a function of which is going\n\n00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:34.563\nto make this possibility real.\n\n00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:38.635\nAnd then finally number three, the hardest.\n\n00:10:38.635 --> 00:10:40.458\nWe're in the age of the Super PAC.\n\n00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:42.567\nIndeed yesterday, Merriam announced\n\n00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:46.817\nthat Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.\n\n00:10:46.817 --> 00:10:50.457\nIt is now an official word in the dictionary.\n\n00:10:50.457 --> 00:10:55.852\nSo on May 1, aka May Day,\n\n00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:58.639\nwe're going to try an experiment.\n\n00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:00.456\nWe're going to try a launching\n\n00:11:00.456 --> 00:11:02.754\nof what we can think of as a Super PAC\n\n00:11:02.754 --> 00:11:06.018\nto end all Super PACs.\n\n00:11:06.018 --> 00:11:07.818\nAnd the basic way this works is this.\n\n00:11:07.818 --> 00:11:09.590\nFor the last year, we have been working\n\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.310\nwith analysts and political experts\n\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.642\nto calculate, how much would it cost\n\n00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:19.064\nto win enough votes in the United States Congress\n\n00:11:19.064 --> 00:11:20.884\nto make fundamental reform possible?\n\n00:11:20.884 --> 00:11:23.686\nWhat is that number? Half a billion? A billion?\n\n00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:25.526\nWhat is that number?\n\n00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:28.291\nAnd then whatever that number is,\n\n00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.396\nwe are going to kickstart, sort of,\n\n00:11:30.396 --> 00:11:32.327\nbecause you can't use KickStarter for political work,\n\n00:11:32.327 --> 00:11:35.098\nbut anyway, kickstart, sort of,\n\n00:11:35.098 --> 00:11:37.454\nfirst a bottom-up campaign\n\n00:11:37.454 --> 00:11:40.434\nwhere people will make small dollar commitments\n\n00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:43.396\ncontingent on reaching very ambitious goals,\n\n00:11:43.396 --> 00:11:45.396\nand when those goals have been reached,\n\n00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:49.535\nwe will turn to the large dollar contributors,\n\n00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:52.917\nto get them to contribute to make it possible\n\n00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:56.440\nfor us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary\n\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.782\nto win this issue,\n\n00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:00.676\nto change the way money influences politics,\n\n00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:04.447\nso that on November 8,\n\n00:12:04.447 --> 00:12:06.775\nwhich I discovered yesterday is the day\n\n00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:10.466\nthat Aaron would have been 30 years old,\n\n00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:13.158\non November 8,\n\n00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:16.697\nwe will celebrate 218 representatives\n\n00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:18.784\nin the House and 60 Senators\n\n00:12:18.784 --> 00:12:20.805\nin the United States Senate\n\n00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:23.098\nwho have committed to this idea\n\n00:12:23.098 --> 00:12:24.964\nof fundamental reform.\n\n00:12:24.964 --> 00:12:28.726\nSo last night, we heard about wishes.\n\n00:12:28.726 --> 00:12:30.814\nHere's my wish.\n\n00:12:30.814 --> 00:12:34.058\nMay one.\n\n00:12:34.058 --> 00:12:37.441\nMay the ideals of one boy\n\n00:12:37.441 --> 00:12:41.922\nunite one nation behind one critical idea\n\n00:12:41.922 --> 00:12:44.383\nthat we are one people,\n\n00:12:44.383 --> 00:12:47.860\nwe are the people who were promised a government,\n\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.989\na government that was promised to be\n\n00:12:49.989 --> 00:12:54.710\ndependent upon the people alone, the people,\n\n00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.559\nwho, as Madison told us,\n\n00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:01.136\nmeant not the rich more than the poor.\n\n00:13:01.136 --> 00:13:03.282\nMay one.\n\n00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:07.461\nAnd then may you, may you join this movement,\n\n00:13:07.461 --> 00:13:09.469\nnot because you're a politician,\n\n00:13:09.469 --> 00:13:11.085\nnot because you're an expert,\n\n00:13:11.085 --> 00:13:14.377\nnot because this is your field,\n\n00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.057\nbut because if you are,\n\n00:13:16.057 --> 00:13:19.728\nyou are a citizen.\n\n00:13:19.728 --> 00:13:22.765\nAaron asked me that.\n\n00:13:22.765 --> 00:13:25.620\nNow I've asked you.\n\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.298\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:27.298 --> 00:13:35.343\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How public spaces make cities work", "duration": "1108", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_burden_how_public_spaces_make_cities_work", "transcript": "When people think about cities, they tend to think of certain things. They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers, noisy cabs. But when I think about cities, I think about people. Cities are fundamentally about people, and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work. So even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them. And today, some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces.So I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city. They are what makes it come alive. But what makes a public space work? What attracts people to successful public spaces, and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away? I thought, if I could answer those questions, I could make a huge contribution to my city. But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist, and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces.One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan. This little space became a small phenomenon, and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers, it made an enormous impression on me. I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather, so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident. I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail. But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it? Well, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully, and first among other things were the comfortable, movable chairs. People would come in, find their own seat, move it a bit, actually, and then stay a while, and then interestingly, people themselves attracted other people, and ironically, I felt more peaceful if there were other people around. And it was green. This little park provided what New Yorkers crave: comfort and greenery. But my question was, why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone, or like a trespasser? Unfortunately, that's not how cities were being designed.So here you see a familiar sight. This is how plazas have been designed for generations. They have that stylish, Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture, but it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this. They not only look desolate, they feel downright dangerous. I mean, where would you sit here? What would you do here? But architects love them. They are plinths for their creations. They might tolerate a sculpture or two, but that's about it. And for developers, they are ideal. There's nothing to water, nothing to maintain, and no undesirable people to worry about. But don't you think this is a waste? For me, becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved. I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in Paley Park, and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this. But over the many years, I have learned how hard it is to create successful, meaningful, enjoyable public spaces. As I learned from my stepfather, they certainly do not happen by accident, especially in a city like New York, where public space has to be fought for to begin with, and then for them to be successful, somebody has to think very hard about every detail.Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities. Yes, they are opportunities for commercial investment, but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city, and those two goals are often not aligned with one another, and therein lies the conflict.The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s, when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River. And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for 10 years, and we were told, unless we found a developer in six months, it would go bankrupt. So we came up with a radical, almost insane idea. Instead of building a park as a complement to future development, why don't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high-quality public open space first, and see if that made a difference. So we only could afford to build a two-block section of what would become a mile-long esplanade, so whatever we built had to be perfect. So just to make sure, I insisted that we build a mock-up in wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall. And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me, the railing hit exactly at eye level, blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge.So you see, details really do make a difference. But design is not just how something looks, it's how your body feels on that seat in that space, and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience. In this photo, everything looks very finished, but that granite edge, those lights, the back on that bench, the trees in planting, and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be.Now, this proved very valuable 20 years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York. And he said to me on that very day, he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people. And he asked me, \"So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers?\"Well, I didn't have any idea. Now, you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants, so we were excited about the prospect of growth, but honestly, where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water? How were we going to find housing for that many new New Yorkers? And if we couldn't spread out, which was probably a good thing, where could new housing go? And what about cars? Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.So what were we going to do? If we couldn't spread out, we had to go up. And if we had to go up, we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car. So that meant using one of our greatest assets: our transit system. But we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it. So here was the answer to our puzzle. If we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit, we could actually handle that population increase, we thought. And so here was the plan, what we really needed to do: We needed to redo our zoning \u2014 and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool \u2014 and basically reshape the entire city, targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car-oriented, suburban-style neighborhoods. Well, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea, ambitious because communities had to approve those plans.So how was I going to get this done? By listening. So I began listening, in fact, thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust. You know, communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods. It's not something you can just fake. And so I began walking. I can't tell you how many blocks I walked, in sweltering summers, in freezing winters, year after year, just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like. I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert, finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns. So little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit. Over the course of 12 years, we were able to rezone 124 neighborhoods, 40 percent of the city, 12,500 blocks, so that now, 90 percent of all new development of New York is within a 10-minute walk of a subway. In other words, nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car.Well, those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important, but rezoning was never my mission. You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning. My mission was always to create great public spaces. So in the areas where we zoned for significant development, I was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's lives. Here you see what was two miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, impossible to get to and impossible to use. Now the zoning here was massive, so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts, and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans. I wanted to make sure that there were tree-lined paths from the upland to the water, that there were trees and plantings everywhere, and, of course, lots and lots of places to sit. Honestly, I had no idea how it would turn out. I had to have faith. But I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans.And then it opened, and I have to tell you, it was incredible. People came from all over the city to be in these parks. I know they changed the lives of the people who live there, but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image of their city. I often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs, and I can't tell you why, but I'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there.And here is a new park in lower Manhattan. Now, the water's edge in lower Manhattan was a complete mess before 9/11. Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge. And after 9/11, the city had very little control. But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan. And it did. Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides.I really love this park. You know, railings have to be higher now, so we put bar seating at the edge, and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it. And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop. And I love when people come there and look up and they say, \"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close.\"So what's the trick? How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be? Well, it's up to you, not as a city planner but as a human being. You don't tap into your design expertise. You tap into your humanity. I mean, would you want to go there? Would you want to stay there? Can you see into it and out of it? Are there other people there? Does it seem green and friendly? Can you find your very own seat?Well now, all over New York City, there are places where you can find your very own seat. Where there used to be parking spaces, there are now pop-up cafes. Where Broadway traffic used to run, there are now tables and chairs. Where 12 years ago, sidewalk cafes were not allowed, they are now everywhere. But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple, and it's even harder to keep them that way.So now I'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the High Line. The High Line was an elevated railway. (Applause) The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side, and when the train stopped running, it became a self-seeded landscape, a kind of a garden in the sky. And when I saw it the first time, honestly, when I went up on that old viaduct, I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person, honestly. And when I was appointed, saving the first two sections of the High Line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project. I knew if there was a day that I didn't worry about the High Line, it would come down. And the High Line, even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular, it is the most contested public space in the city. You might see a beautiful park, but not everyone does. You know, it's true, commercial interests will always battle against public space. You might say, \"How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line.\" Well, a developer sees just one thing: customers. Hey, why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line? Wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city? Well no, it would not be terrific. It would be a mall, and not a park. (Applause) And you know what, it might mean more money for the city, but a city has to take the long view, the view for the common good. Most recently, the last section of the High Line, the third section of the High Line, the final section of the High Line, has been pitted against development interests, where some of the city's leading developers are building more than 17 million square feet at the Hudson Yards. And they came to me and proposed that they \"temporarily disassemble\" that third and final section. Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill. Perhaps it was just in their way. But in any case, it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition, and that was only two years ago.So you see, no matter how popular and successful a public space may be, it can never be taken for granted. Public spaces always \u2014 this is it saved \u2014 public spaces always need vigilant champions, not only to claim them at the outset for public use, but to design them for the people that use them, then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone, that they are not violated, invaded, abandoned or ignored. If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner, it is that public spaces have power. It's not just the number of people using them, it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. Public space can change how you live in a city, how you feel about a city, whether you choose one city over another, and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city.I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time.Thank you.(Applause) Thank you.

tend to think of certain things.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.018\nThey think of buildings and streets\n\n00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.914\nand skyscrapers, noisy cabs.\n\n00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:23.848\nBut when I think about cities,\n\n00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:25.649\nI think about people.\n\n00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.119\nCities are fundamentally about people,\n\n00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.963\nand where people go\n\n00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:32.478\nand where people meet\n\n00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:35.808\nare at the core of what makes a city work.\n\n00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:38.988\nSo even more important than buildings in a city\n\n00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.996\nare the public spaces in between them.\n\n00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:44.654\nAnd today, some of the most transformative\n\n00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:46.331\nchanges in cities\n\n00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:49.517\nare happening in these public spaces.\n\n00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:53.710\nSo I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces\n\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.830\nare the key to planning a great city.\n\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.250\nThey are what makes it come alive.\n\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.930\nBut what makes a public space work?\n\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.481\nWhat attracts people to successful public spaces,\n\n00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:09.903\nand what is it about unsuccessful places\n\n00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.583\nthat keeps people away?\n\n00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:15.942\nI thought, if I could answer those questions,\n\n00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.722\nI could make a huge contribution to my city.\n\n00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:21.876\nBut one of the more wonky things about me\n\n00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:25.427\nis that I am an animal behaviorist,\n\n00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:29.004\nand I use those skills not to study animal behavior\n\n00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:31.938\nbut to study how people in cities\n\n00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:34.186\nuse city public spaces.\n\n00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:37.507\nOne of the first spaces that I studied\n\n00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:40.912\nwas this little vest pocket park called Paley Park\n\n00:01:40.912 --> 00:01:43.220\nin midtown Manhattan.\n\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.345\nThis little space became a small phenomenon,\n\n00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:50.213\nand because it had such a profound impact\n\n00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:51.429\non New Yorkers,\n\n00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.513\nit made an enormous impression on me.\n\n00:01:55.513 --> 00:01:58.010\nI studied this park very early on in my career\n\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.596\nbecause it happened to have been built\n\n00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:01.374\nby my stepfather,\n\n00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:04.006\nso I knew that places like Paley Park\n\n00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.406\ndidn't happen by accident.\n\n00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:08.958\nI saw firsthand that they required\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.414\nincredible dedication\n\n00:02:10.414 --> 00:02:13.472\nand enormous attention to detail.\n\n00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:15.206\nBut what was it about this space\n\n00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:19.008\nthat made it special and drew people to it?\n\n00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.909\nWell, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,\n\n00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.801\nand first among other things\n\n00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:26.864\nwere the comfortable, movable chairs.\n\n00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:29.374\nPeople would come in, find their own seat,\n\n00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:32.768\nmove it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,\n\n00:02:32.768 --> 00:02:34.616\nand then interestingly,\n\n00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:37.591\npeople themselves attracted other people,\n\n00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.368\nand ironically, I felt more peaceful\n\n00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.349\nif there were other people around.\n\n00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.239\nAnd it was green.\n\n00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.000\nThis little park provided what New Yorkers crave:\n\n00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.538\ncomfort and greenery.\n\n00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:52.226\nBut my question was,\n\n00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:55.288\nwhy weren't there more places with greenery\n\n00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.797\nand places to sit in the middle of the city\n\n00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:00.277\nwhere you didn't feel alone,\n\n00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:02.734\nor like a trespasser?\n\n00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.966\nUnfortunately, that's not how cities\n\n00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:06.984\nwere being designed.\n\n00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:10.678\nSo here you see a familiar sight.\n\n00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:14.959\nThis is how plazas have been\ndesigned for generations.\n\n00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.089\nThey have that stylish, Spartan look\n\n00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:21.909\nthat we often associate with modern architecture,\n\n00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.220\nbut it's not surprising that people\n\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.082\navoid spaces like this.\n\n00:03:26.082 --> 00:03:28.192\nThey not only look desolate,\n\n00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:30.904\nthey feel downright dangerous.\n\n00:03:30.904 --> 00:03:34.181\nI mean, where would you sit here?\n\n00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.727\nWhat would you do here?\n\n00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:40.203\nBut architects love them.\n\n00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:43.476\nThey are plinths for their creations.\n\n00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:45.409\nThey might tolerate a sculpture or two,\n\n00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.162\nbut that's about it.\n\n00:03:47.162 --> 00:03:50.366\nAnd for developers, they are ideal.\n\n00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:52.953\nThere's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,\n\n00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:56.913\nand no undesirable people to worry about.\n\n00:03:56.913 --> 00:04:00.157\nBut don't you think this is a waste?\n\n00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:02.478\nFor me, becoming a city planner\n\n00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:05.150\nmeant being able to truly change the city\n\n00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.640\nthat I lived in and loved.\n\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.128\nI wanted to be able to create places\n\n00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:12.093\nthat would give you the feeling that you got\n\n00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:13.631\nin Paley Park,\n\n00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:18.419\nand not allow developers to\nbuild bleak plazas like this.\n\n00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.834\nBut over the many years,\n\n00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:22.430\nI have learned how hard it is\n\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.018\nto create successful, meaningful,\n\n00:04:25.018 --> 00:04:27.046\nenjoyable public spaces.\n\n00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:28.623\nAs I learned from my stepfather,\n\n00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:30.911\nthey certainly do not happen by accident,\n\n00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.739\nespecially in a city like New York,\n\n00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:37.018\nwhere public space has to\nbe fought for to begin with,\n\n00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:39.126\nand then for them to be successful,\n\n00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:41.148\nsomebody has to think very hard\n\n00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:43.172\nabout every detail.\n\n00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:47.118\nNow, open spaces in cities are opportunities.\n\n00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:50.922\nYes, they are opportunities\nfor commercial investment,\n\n00:04:50.922 --> 00:04:54.491\nbut they are also opportunities for the common good\n\n00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.257\nof the city,\n\n00:04:56.257 --> 00:04:59.772\nand those two goals are often\nnot aligned with one another,\n\n00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:02.381\nand therein lies the conflict.\n\n00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:05.033\nThe first opportunity I had to fight\n\n00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:08.195\nfor a great public open space was in the early 1980s,\n\n00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:10.533\nwhen I was leading a team of planners\n\n00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:13.845\nat a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City\n\n00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:16.458\nin lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.\n\n00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:19.272\nAnd this sandy wasteland had lain barren\n\n00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:20.722\nfor 10 years,\n\n00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:23.366\nand we were told, unless we found a developer\n\n00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.494\nin six months, it would go bankrupt.\n\n00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:27.495\nSo we came up with a radical,\n\n00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:29.885\nalmost insane idea.\n\n00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:31.733\nInstead of building a park\n\n00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:34.241\nas a complement to future development,\n\n00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:36.326\nwhy don't we reverse that equation\n\n00:05:36.326 --> 00:05:39.379\nand build a small but very high-quality\n\n00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.364\npublic open space first,\n\n00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:44.370\nand see if that made a difference.\n\n00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.068\nSo we only could afford to build a two-block section\n\n00:05:48.068 --> 00:05:51.528\nof what would become a mile-long esplanade,\n\n00:05:51.528 --> 00:05:54.495\nso whatever we built had to be perfect.\n\n00:05:54.495 --> 00:05:57.491\nSo just to make sure, I insisted\n\n00:05:57.491 --> 00:05:59.708\nthat we build a mock-up\n\n00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:03.642\nin wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.\n\n00:06:03.642 --> 00:06:06.666\nAnd when I sat down on that test bench\n\n00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.864\nwith sand still swirling all around me,\n\n00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:12.957\nthe railing hit exactly at eye level,\n\n00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:15.948\nblocking my view and ruining my experience\n\n00:06:15.948 --> 00:06:18.078\nat the water's edge.\n\n00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:21.385\nSo you see, details really do make a difference.\n\n00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:25.316\nBut design is not just how something looks,\n\n00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:31.208\nit's how your body feels on that seat in that space,\n\n00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:34.348\nand I believe that successful design always depends\n\n00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:37.773\non that very individual experience.\n\n00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:42.144\nIn this photo, everything looks very finished,\n\n00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:44.862\nbut that granite edge, those lights,\n\n00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.750\nthe back on that bench,\n\n00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.444\nthe trees in planting,\n\n00:06:48.444 --> 00:06:51.047\nand the many different kinds of places to sit\n\n00:06:51.047 --> 00:06:54.229\nwere all little battles that turned this project\n\n00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.273\ninto a place that people wanted to be.\n\n00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:02.108\nNow, this proved very valuable 20 years later\n\n00:07:02.108 --> 00:07:04.116\nwhen Michael Bloomberg asked me to be\n\n00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:05.698\nhis planning commissioner\n\n00:07:05.698 --> 00:07:07.545\nand put me in charge of shaping\n\n00:07:07.545 --> 00:07:09.616\nthe entire city of New York.\n\n00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:11.715\nAnd he said to me on that very day,\n\n00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:13.811\nhe said that New York was projected\n\n00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.868\nto grow from eight to nine million people.\n\n00:07:16.868 --> 00:07:18.398\nAnd he asked me,\n\n00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:20.241\n\"So where are you going to put\n\n00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:22.957\none million additional New Yorkers?\"\n\n00:07:22.957 --> 00:07:25.602\nWell, I didn't have any idea.\n\n00:07:25.602 --> 00:07:28.641\nNow, you know that New York does\n\n00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.339\nplace a high value on attracting immigrants,\n\n00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.259\nso we were excited about the prospect of growth,\n\n00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.138\nbut honestly, where were we going to grow\n\n00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:40.532\nin a city that was already built out to its edges\n\n00:07:40.532 --> 00:07:43.332\nand surrounded by water?\n\n00:07:43.332 --> 00:07:44.934\nHow were we going to find housing\n\n00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:47.232\nfor that many new New Yorkers?\n\n00:07:47.232 --> 00:07:49.045\nAnd if we couldn't spread out,\n\n00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:50.859\nwhich was probably a good thing,\n\n00:07:50.859 --> 00:07:53.678\nwhere could new housing go?\n\n00:07:53.678 --> 00:07:55.311\nAnd what about cars?\n\n00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:59.423\nOur city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.\n\n00:07:59.423 --> 00:08:02.257\nSo what were we going to do?\n\n00:08:02.257 --> 00:08:06.234\nIf we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.\n\n00:08:06.234 --> 00:08:07.268\nAnd if we had to go up,\n\n00:08:07.268 --> 00:08:09.050\nwe had to go up in places\n\n00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.059\nwhere you wouldn't need to own a car.\n\n00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:13.922\nSo that meant using one of our greatest assets:\n\n00:08:13.922 --> 00:08:16.374\nour transit system.\n\n00:08:16.374 --> 00:08:17.947\nBut we had never before thought\n\n00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:20.183\nof how we could make the most of it.\n\n00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:23.396\nSo here was the answer to our puzzle.\n\n00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:27.027\nIf we were to channel and redirect\n\n00:08:27.027 --> 00:08:29.321\nall new development around transit,\n\n00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:32.948\nwe could actually handle that population increase,\n\n00:08:32.948 --> 00:08:34.222\nwe thought.\n\n00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.780\nAnd so here was the plan,\n\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.428\nwhat we really needed to do:\n\n00:08:38.428 --> 00:08:41.276\nWe needed to redo our zoning --\n\n00:08:41.276 --> 00:08:44.627\nand zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool --\n\n00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:47.938\nand basically reshape the entire city,\n\n00:08:47.938 --> 00:08:50.083\ntargeting where new development could go\n\n00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:52.274\nand prohibiting any development at all\n\n00:08:52.274 --> 00:08:53.988\nin our car-oriented,\n\n00:08:53.988 --> 00:08:56.150\nsuburban-style neighborhoods.\n\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.882\nWell, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,\n\n00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:02.458\nambitious because communities\n\n00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:06.073\nhad to approve those plans.\n\n00:09:06.073 --> 00:09:09.092\nSo how was I going to get this done?\n\n00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:12.000\nBy listening. So I began listening,\n\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.354\nin fact, thousands of hours of listening\n\n00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.172\njust to establish trust.\n\n00:09:17.172 --> 00:09:19.261\nYou know, communities can tell\n\n00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:21.413\nwhether or not you understand their neighborhoods.\n\n00:09:21.413 --> 00:09:24.509\nIt's not something you can just fake.\n\n00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:27.215\nAnd so I began walking.\n\n00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:29.535\nI can't tell you how many blocks I walked,\n\n00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:32.944\nin sweltering summers, in freezing winters,\n\n00:09:32.944 --> 00:09:34.774\nyear after year,\n\n00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.862\njust so I could get to understand\n\n00:09:36.862 --> 00:09:38.889\nthe DNA of each neighborhood\n\n00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:41.464\nand know what each street felt like.\n\n00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:44.959\nI became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,\n\n00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.028\nfinding ways that zoning could address\n\n00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:49.090\ncommunities' concerns.\n\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.662\nSo little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,\n\n00:09:51.662 --> 00:09:53.097\nblock by block,\n\n00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:54.970\nwe began to set height limits\n\n00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.702\nso that all new development\n\n00:09:56.702 --> 00:10:00.319\nwould be predictable and near transit.\n\n00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:02.100\nOver the course of 12 years,\n\n00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.569\nwe were able to rezone\n\n00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:07.138\n124 neighborhoods,\n\n00:10:07.138 --> 00:10:09.917\n40 percent of the city,\n\n00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:14.456\n12,500 blocks, so that now,\n\n00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:17.693\n90 percent of all new development of New York\n\n00:10:17.693 --> 00:10:20.341\nis within a 10-minute walk of a subway.\n\n00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:22.991\nIn other words, nobody in those new buildings\n\n00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:24.867\nneeds to own a car.\n\n00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:28.960\nWell, those rezonings were exhausting\n\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.998\nand enervating and important,\n\n00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:34.548\nbut rezoning was never my mission.\n\n00:10:34.548 --> 00:10:38.039\nYou can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.\n\n00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:40.127\nMy mission was always to create\n\n00:10:40.127 --> 00:10:42.051\ngreat public spaces.\n\n00:10:42.051 --> 00:10:45.943\nSo in the areas where we zoned\nfor significant development,\n\n00:10:45.943 --> 00:10:48.134\nI was determined to create places\n\n00:10:48.134 --> 00:10:50.828\nthat would make a difference in people's lives.\n\n00:10:50.828 --> 00:10:52.914\nHere you see what was\n\n00:10:52.914 --> 00:10:55.338\ntwo miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront\n\n00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:57.105\nin the neighborhoods of Greenpoint\n\n00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:58.887\nand Williamsburg in Brooklyn,\n\n00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:02.447\nimpossible to get to and impossible to use.\n\n00:11:02.447 --> 00:11:04.941\nNow the zoning here was massive,\n\n00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:07.963\nso I felt an obligation to create\n\n00:11:07.963 --> 00:11:10.988\nmagnificent parks on these waterfronts,\n\n00:11:10.988 --> 00:11:13.728\nand I spent an incredible amount of time\n\n00:11:13.728 --> 00:11:16.833\non every square inch of these plans.\n\n00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:18.898\nI wanted to make sure that there were\n\n00:11:18.898 --> 00:11:21.437\ntree-lined paths from the upland to the water,\n\n00:11:21.437 --> 00:11:23.848\nthat there were trees and plantings everywhere,\n\n00:11:23.848 --> 00:11:28.036\nand, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.\n\n00:11:28.036 --> 00:11:31.406\nHonestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.\n\n00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:33.031\nI had to have faith.\n\n00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:35.994\nBut I put everything that I had studied and learned\n\n00:11:35.994 --> 00:11:37.728\ninto those plans.\n\n00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:39.388\nAnd then it opened,\n\n00:11:39.388 --> 00:11:42.675\nand I have to tell you, it was incredible.\n\n00:11:42.675 --> 00:11:44.760\nPeople came from all over the city\n\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.417\nto be in these parks.\n\n00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:49.837\nI know they changed the lives\nof the people who live there,\n\n00:11:49.837 --> 00:11:52.332\nbut they also changed New Yorkers' whole image\n\n00:11:52.332 --> 00:11:54.108\nof their city.\n\n00:11:54.108 --> 00:11:55.687\nI often come down and watch people\n\n00:11:55.687 --> 00:11:57.203\nget on this little ferry\n\n00:11:57.203 --> 00:11:59.181\nthat now runs between the boroughs,\n\n00:11:59.181 --> 00:12:00.668\nand I can't tell you why,\n\n00:12:00.668 --> 00:12:02.240\nbut I'm completely moved\n\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.387\nby the fact that people are using it\n\n00:12:04.387 --> 00:12:06.569\nas if it had always been there.\n\n00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:09.842\nAnd here is a new park in lower Manhattan.\n\n00:12:09.842 --> 00:12:12.599\nNow, the water's edge in lower Manhattan\n\n00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:15.532\nwas a complete mess before 9/11.\n\n00:12:15.532 --> 00:12:17.447\nWall Street was essentially landlocked\n\n00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:20.033\nbecause you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.\n\n00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:23.867\nAnd after 9/11, the city had very little control.\n\n00:12:23.867 --> 00:12:25.412\nBut I thought if we went\n\n00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.557\nto the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation\n\n00:12:27.557 --> 00:12:30.518\nand got money to reclaim this two miles\n\n00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:32.314\nof degraded waterfront\n\n00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:34.165\nthat it would have an enormous effect\n\n00:12:34.165 --> 00:12:36.626\non the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.\n\n00:12:36.626 --> 00:12:37.806\nAnd it did.\n\n00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:41.197\nLower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront\n\n00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:43.311\non all three sides.\n\n00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:45.695\nI really love this park.\n\n00:12:45.695 --> 00:12:47.920\nYou know, railings have to be higher now,\n\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.464\nso we put bar seating at the edge,\n\n00:12:50.464 --> 00:12:52.576\nand you can get so close to the water\n\n00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:54.304\nyou're practically on it.\n\n00:12:54.304 --> 00:12:56.173\nAnd see how the railing widens\n\n00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:57.589\nand flattens out so you can lay down\n\n00:12:57.589 --> 00:12:59.471\nyour lunch or your laptop.\n\n00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:01.451\nAnd I love when people come there\n\n00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:03.311\nand look up and they say,\n\n00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:07.338\n\"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close.\"\n\n00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:09.690\nSo what's the trick?\n\n00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.499\nHow do you turn a park\n\n00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:14.665\ninto a place that people want to be?\n\n00:13:14.665 --> 00:13:17.508\nWell, it's up to you,\n\n00:13:17.508 --> 00:13:20.873\nnot as a city planner but as a human being.\n\n00:13:20.873 --> 00:13:24.273\nYou don't tap into your design expertise.\n\n00:13:24.273 --> 00:13:27.788\nYou tap into your humanity.\n\n00:13:27.788 --> 00:13:31.114\nI mean, would you want to go there?\n\n00:13:31.114 --> 00:13:33.097\nWould you want to stay there?\n\n00:13:33.097 --> 00:13:35.235\nCan you see into it and out of it?\n\n00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:37.487\nAre there other people there?\n\n00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:40.134\nDoes it seem green and friendly?\n\n00:13:40.134 --> 00:13:43.372\nCan you find your very own seat?\n\n00:13:43.372 --> 00:13:46.401\nWell now, all over New York City,\n\n00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:47.905\nthere are places where you can\n\n00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:49.759\nfind your very own seat.\n\n00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:52.281\nWhere there used to be parking spaces,\n\n00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:54.574\nthere are now pop-up cafes.\n\n00:13:54.574 --> 00:13:56.552\nWhere Broadway traffic used to run,\n\n00:13:56.552 --> 00:13:58.516\nthere are now tables and chairs.\n\n00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:02.070\nWhere 12 years ago, sidewalk\ncafes were not allowed,\n\n00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.043\nthey are now everywhere.\n\n00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:07.038\nBut claiming these spaces for public use\n\n00:14:07.038 --> 00:14:08.177\nwas not simple,\n\n00:14:08.177 --> 00:14:10.839\nand it's even harder to keep them that way.\n\n00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:12.528\nSo now I'm going to tell you a story\n\n00:14:12.528 --> 00:14:16.808\nabout a very unusual park called the High Line.\n\n00:14:16.808 --> 00:14:18.862\nThe High Line was an elevated railway.\n\n00:14:18.862 --> 00:14:25.493\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:27.769\nThe High Line was an elevated railway\n\n00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:29.581\nthat ran through three neighborhoods\n\n00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:31.451\non Manhattan's West Side,\n\n00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:33.196\nand when the train stopped running,\n\n00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:35.352\nit became a self-seeded landscape,\n\n00:14:35.352 --> 00:14:37.959\na kind of a garden in the sky.\n\n00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:40.108\nAnd when I saw it the first time,\n\n00:14:40.108 --> 00:14:42.754\nhonestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,\n\n00:14:42.754 --> 00:14:45.570\nI fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,\n\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.797\nhonestly.\n\n00:14:46.797 --> 00:14:48.918\nAnd when I was appointed,\n\n00:14:48.918 --> 00:14:50.994\nsaving the first two sections of the High Line\n\n00:14:50.994 --> 00:14:54.366\nfrom demolition became my first priority\n\n00:14:54.366 --> 00:14:57.038\nand my most important project.\n\n00:14:57.038 --> 00:15:00.306\nI knew if there was a day that I didn't\n\n00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:03.909\nworry about the High Line, it would come down.\n\n00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:05.898\nAnd the High Line,\n\n00:15:05.898 --> 00:15:08.358\neven though it is widely known now\n\n00:15:08.358 --> 00:15:10.177\nand phenomenally popular,\n\n00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:14.081\nit is the most contested public space in the city.\n\n00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:16.956\nYou might see a beautiful park,\n\n00:15:16.956 --> 00:15:19.403\nbut not everyone does.\n\n00:15:19.403 --> 00:15:22.040\nYou know, it's true, commercial interests\n\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.257\nwill always battle against public space.\n\n00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.081\nYou might say,\n\n00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:28.651\n\"How wonderful it is that more than\n\n00:15:28.651 --> 00:15:31.082\nfour million people come from all over the world\n\n00:15:31.082 --> 00:15:32.729\nto visit the High Line.\"\n\n00:15:32.729 --> 00:15:37.345\nWell, a developer sees just one thing: customers.\n\n00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:40.070\nHey, why not take out those plantings\n\n00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.078\nand have shops all along the High Line?\n\n00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:43.575\nWouldn't that be terrific\n\n00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:46.110\nand won't it mean a lot more money for the city?\n\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.602\nWell no, it would not be terrific.\n\n00:15:48.602 --> 00:15:51.901\nIt would be a mall, and not a park.\n\n00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:59.280\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.788\nAnd you know what, it might mean\n\n00:16:00.788 --> 00:16:02.998\nmore money for the city,\n\n00:16:02.998 --> 00:16:07.047\nbut a city has to take the long view,\n\n00:16:07.047 --> 00:16:09.983\nthe view for the common good.\n\n00:16:09.983 --> 00:16:13.698\nMost recently, the last section of the High Line,\n\n00:16:13.698 --> 00:16:15.314\nthe third section of the High Line,\n\n00:16:15.314 --> 00:16:16.884\nthe final section of the High Line,\n\n00:16:16.884 --> 00:16:19.686\nhas been pitted against development interests,\n\n00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:21.986\nwhere some of the city's leading developers\n\n00:16:21.986 --> 00:16:24.668\nare building more than 17 million square feet\n\n00:16:24.668 --> 00:16:26.968\nat the Hudson Yards.\n\n00:16:26.968 --> 00:16:28.929\nAnd they came to me and proposed\n\n00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:31.488\nthat they \"temporarily disassemble\"\n\n00:16:31.488 --> 00:16:34.218\nthat third and final section.\n\n00:16:34.218 --> 00:16:36.681\nPerhaps the High Line didn't fit in\n\n00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:39.568\nwith their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers\n\n00:16:39.568 --> 00:16:41.031\non a hill.\n\n00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:43.755\nPerhaps it was just in their way.\n\n00:16:43.755 --> 00:16:46.243\nBut in any case, it took nine months\n\n00:16:46.243 --> 00:16:48.717\nof nonstop daily negotiation\n\n00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.730\nto finally get the signed agreement\n\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.754\nto prohibit its demolition,\n\n00:16:52.754 --> 00:16:56.563\nand that was only two years ago.\n\n00:16:56.563 --> 00:16:59.021\nSo you see, no matter how popular\n\n00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:01.857\nand successful a public space may be,\n\n00:17:01.857 --> 00:17:04.273\nit can never be taken for granted.\n\n00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.854\nPublic spaces always -- this is it saved --\n\n00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:10.566\npublic spaces always need vigilant champions,\n\n00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:14.266\nnot only to claim them at the outset for public use,\n\n00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:17.797\nbut to design them for the people that use them,\n\n00:17:17.797 --> 00:17:19.828\nthen to maintain them to ensure\n\n00:17:19.828 --> 00:17:21.798\nthat they are for everyone,\n\n00:17:21.798 --> 00:17:24.211\nthat they are not violated, invaded,\n\n00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.848\nabandoned or ignored.\n\n00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:28.492\nIf there is any one lesson\n\n00:17:28.492 --> 00:17:31.644\nthat I have learned in my life as a city planner,\n\n00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:35.404\nit is that public spaces have power.\n\n00:17:35.404 --> 00:17:38.473\nIt's not just the number of people using them,\n\n00:17:38.473 --> 00:17:40.427\nit's the even greater number of people\n\n00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.546\nwho feel better about their city\n\n00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:45.778\njust knowing that they are there.\n\n00:17:45.778 --> 00:17:49.250\nPublic space can change how you live in a city,\n\n00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.420\nhow you feel about a city,\n\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.708\nwhether you choose one city over another,\n\n00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:57.479\nand public space is one of\nthe most important reasons\n\n00:17:57.479 --> 00:18:00.600\nwhy you stay in a city.\n\n00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.065\nI believe that a successful city\n\n00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:05.686\nis like a fabulous party.\n\n00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:09.591\nPeople stay because they are having a great time.\n\n00:18:09.591 --> 00:18:11.534\nThank you.\n\n00:18:11.534 --> 00:18:17.487\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:17.487 --> 00:18:22.117\nThank you.

Right now there is an aspiring teacher in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible. Right now there's a first-year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards, who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately, while at the same time saying to herself over and over again, \"Don't smile till November,\" because that's what she was taught in her teacher education program. Right now there's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he's very, very sick and can't make it to school tomorrow. On the other hand, right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information, information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge. Right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention, a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before, but if they close their eyes tightly enough, they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling. Right now there's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says, \"Put them down.\" Right now.So people will then say, \"Well, Chris, you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you're also describing these powerful educators. If you're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular, these guys will probably cancel each other out, and then we'll be okay.\"The reality is, the folks I described as the master teachers, the master narrative builders, the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms. The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don't even know what teacher certification means. They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education. And that to me is sad. It's sad because the people who I described, they were very disinterested in the learning process, want to be effective teachers, but they have no models. I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain. Mark Twain says that proper preparation, or teaching, is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good, it can turn awful practices into powerful ones, it can change men and transform them into angels.The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching, not in any college or university, but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage. Guess where those places are? Barber shops, rap concerts, and most importantly, in the black church. And I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy. Who here has been to a black church? We got a couple of hands. You go to a black church, their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience, so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes, and then he takes a pause, and he says, \"Oh my gosh, they're not quite paying attention.\" So he says, \"Can I get an amen?\"Audience: Amen.Chris Emdin: So I can I get an amen? Audience: Amen.CE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken. That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention. He drops his voice at a very, very low volume when he wants people to key into him, and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers. So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills, that magic that you need to engage an audience, to engage a student? So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education, that we could focus on content, and that's fine, and we could focus on theories, and that's fine, but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing.Now people oftentimes say, \"Well, magic is just magic.\" There are teachers who, despite all their challenges, who have those skills, get into those schools and are  able to engage an audience, and the administrator walks by and says, \"Wow, he's so good, I wish all my teachers could be that good.\" And when they try to describe what that is, they just say, \"He has that magic.\"But I'm here to tell you that magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Now, how do you teach it? You teach it by allowing people to go into those spaces where the magic is happening. If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education, you've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood. You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop, you've got to attend that black church, and you've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do. At our teacher education classes at my university, I've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts. They watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands. They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage. They listen to his metaphors and analogies, and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic. They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch, you don't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more. And if we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof! we could make dead classes come alive, we could reignite imaginations, and we can change education.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1965, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:14.755\nRight now\n\n00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:17.497\nthere

view those folks\n\n00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.738\nthat have the power to engage\n\n00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:55.518\nand just take notes on what they do.\n\n00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:58.518\nAt our teacher education classes at my university,\n\n00:05:58.518 --> 00:06:00.912\nI've started a project where every single student\n\n00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:05.504\nthat comes in there sits and watches rap concerts.\n\n00:06:05.504 --> 00:06:07.727\nThey watch the way that the rappers move\n\n00:06:07.727 --> 00:06:09.260\nand talk with their hands.\n\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.240\nThey study the way that he\nwalks proudly across that stage.\n\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.446\nThey listen to his metaphors and analogies,\n\n00:06:14.446 --> 00:06:16.058\nand they start learning these little things\n\n00:06:16.058 --> 00:06:17.858\nthat if they practice enough\n\n00:06:17.858 --> 00:06:19.547\nbecomes the key to magic.\n\n00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:21.808\nThey learn that if you just stare at a student\n\n00:06:21.808 --> 00:06:24.311\nand raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch,\n\n00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:25.778\nyou don't have to say a word\n\n00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:29.351\nbecause they know that that\nmeans that you want more.\n\n00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:31.806\nAnd if we could transform teacher education\n\n00:06:31.806 --> 00:06:34.068\nto focus on teaching teachers\n\n00:06:34.068 --> 00:06:36.021\nhow to create that magic\n\n00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.818\nthen poof! we could make dead classes come alive,\n\n00:06:39.818 --> 00:06:41.532\nwe could reignite imaginations,\n\n00:06:41.532 --> 00:06:43.248\nand we can change education.\n\n00:06:43.248 --> 00:06:46.342\nThank you.\n\n00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:49.181\n(Applause)"}, {"title": " Hidden miracles of the natural world", "duration": "444", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/louie_schwartzberg_hidden_miracles_of_the_natural_world", "transcript": "What is the intersection between technology, art and science? Curiosity and wonder, because it drives us to explore, because we're surrounded by things we can't see. And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space, to make the invisible visible, because what that does, it expands our horizons, it transforms our perception, it opens our minds and it touches our heart. So here are some scenes from my 3D IMAX film, \"Mysteries of the Unseen World.\"(Music)There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect, and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life. We can see how organisms emerge and grow, how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight. And at the grand scale, time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion. We can view not only the vast sweep of nature, but the restless movement of humanity. Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane, and by turning air traffic data into time-lapse imagery, we can see something that's above us constantly but invisible: the vast network of air travel over the United States. We can do the same thing with ships at sea. We can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion. And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere, pulsing with lightning, crowned by the aurora Borealis. It may be the ultimate time-lapse image: the anatomy of Earth brought to life.At the other extreme, there are things that move too fast for our eyes, but we have technology that can look into that world as well. With high-speed cameras, we can do the opposite of time lapse. We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision. And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work, and perhaps we can even imitate them. When a dragonfly flutters by, you may not realize, but it's the greatest flier in nature. It can hover, fly backwards, even upside down. And by tracking markers on an insect's wings, we can visualize the air flow that they produce. Nobody knew the secret, but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time. And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places.We're giants, and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see. The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times. This is the egg of a butterfly. And there are unseen creatures living all over your body, including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes, crawling over your skin at night. Can you guess what this is? Shark skin. A caterpillar's mouth. The eye of a fruit fly. An eggshell. A flea. A snail's tongue. We think we know most of the animal kingdom, but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered.A spider also has great secrets, because spiders' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic. This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world. The silk is 100 times thinner than human hair. On there is bacteria, and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller, a virus. Inside of that, 10 times smaller, three strands of DNA. And nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes, single carbon atoms.With the tip of a powerful microscope, we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices. Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way. Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day, perhaps, repair DNA. We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances, born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life.So under an endless rain of cosmic dust, the air is full of pollen, micro-diamonds and jewels from other planets and supernova explosions. People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable. Knowing that there's so much around us we can't see forever changes our understanding of the world, and by looking at unseen worlds, we recognize that we exist in the living universe, and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards.Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives.We'll just have to see.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1969, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:17.362\nWhat is the intersection\nbetween technology,

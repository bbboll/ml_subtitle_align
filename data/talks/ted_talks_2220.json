You might think that these plants look dead, but they're not. Give them water, and they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.Now, why would I suggest that producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security? Well, the current world population is around 7 billion. And it's estimated that by 2050, we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people, with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.The food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand. Given that plants are at the base of the food chain, most of that's going to have to come from plants.That percentage of 70 percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011, where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them \u2014 amongst other things \u2014 increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain. The areas in red shown here, are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture, but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall. This is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050. Much of Africa, in fact, much of the world, is going to be in trouble. We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food. And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed.Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world. And the reason for this is water. Water is essential to life on this planet. All living, actively metabolizing organisms, from microbes to you and I, are comprised predominately of water. All life reactions happen in water. And loss of a small amount of water results in death. You and I are 65 percent water \u2014 we lose one percent of that, we die. But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that. Plants can't. They're stuck in the ground. And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us, about 95 percent water, and they can lose a little bit more than us, like 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species, but for short periods only.Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss. So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents. They tend to be small, very attractive, but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly. Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs. They send down very deep roots, mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times, keeping themselves hydrated.The one on the right is called a baobab. It's also called the upside-down tree, simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down. And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals. Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies. Up the west coast of my country, for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth. But come the spring rains, you get this: flowering of the desert.The strategy in annuals, is to grow only in the rainy season. At the end of that season they produce a seed, which is dry, eight to 10 percent water, but very much alive. And anything that is that dry and still alive, we call desiccation-tolerant.In the desiccated state, what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time. The next time the rainy season comes, they germinate and grow, and the whole cycle just starts again.It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies. Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies. And it's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed. Seeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories, you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine, but there's a downside. The vegetative tissues, the roots and leaves of annuals, do not have much by way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics. They just don't need them. They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance, avoidance and tolerance \u2014 particularly resistance and avoidance because we've had good models to understand how those work \u2014 we still get images like this. Maize crop in Africa, two weeks without rain and it's dead.There is a solution: resurrection plants. These plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water, remain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years, and give them water, they green up and start growing again. Like seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant. Like seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions. And this is a really rare phenomenon. There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order. And at the bottom, there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.(Applause)Pretty amazing, huh?So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this. How do these plants dry without dying? And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants, shown here in the hydrated and dry states, for a number of reasons.One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.So on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass, it's called Eragrostis nindensis, it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef \u2014 a lot of you might know it as \"teff\" \u2014 it's a staple food in Ethiopia, it's gluten-free, and it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.The other reason for looking at a number of plants, is that, at least initially, I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing? Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die?So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance, in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure. We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off, in response to drying. Most genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome. What are the proteins made in response to drying? Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites, so we look at the metabolome.Now, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground. They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment. So it's important that we look at the chemical changes involved in drying.And at the last study that we do at the molecular level, we look at the lipidome \u2014 the lipid changes in response to drying. And that's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids. They're held as membranes because they're in water. Take away the water, those membranes fall apart. Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes.Then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we've actually discovered in our other studies. And then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment.I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.I'm sure some of you are thinking, \"By biotic application, does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?\" And the answer to that question is: depends on your definition of genetic modification.All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize, are highly genetically modified from their ancestors, but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding. If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops, your answer is yes.In the essence of time, we have tried that approach. More appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT, Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen, have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon.But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach, in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop. They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions. I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not.I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach. And in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work.So you probably all know that genes are made of double-stranded DNA. It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body. If you unwind that DNA, you get genes. And each gene has a promoter, which is just an on-off switch, the gene coding region, and then a terminator, which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.Now, promoters are not simple on-off switches. They normally require a lot of fine-tuning, lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on. So what's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter, we know how to switch it on. We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.In the study that I'm going to talk to you about, my collaborators used a drought-induced promoter, which we discovered in a resurrection plant. The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing. The plant itself senses drought. And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants. Why antioxidant genes? Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress, results in the formation of free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, which are highly damaging and can cause crop death. What antioxidants do is stop that damage.So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa. To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes, to the right \u2014 plants with the antioxidant genes. After three weeks without watering, the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.Now to the final approach. My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants. So I ask the question, are they using the same genes? Or slightly differently phrased, are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves? Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?And I answer that question, as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands, Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France. The answer is yes, that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize, where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance. So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development, they switch these genes on. Resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out. All modern crops, therefore, have these genes in their roots and leaves, they just never switch them on. They only switch them on in seed tissues.So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants, to mimic the process in crops.And just a final thought. What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some 10 to 40 million years ago.My plants and I thank you for your attention.(Applause)",

desert.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.814\nThe strategy in annuals,\n\n00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:03.198\nis to grow only in the rainy season.\n\n00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:06.214\nAt the end of that season\nthey produce a seed,\n\n00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:09.054\nwhich is dry, eight to 10 percent water,\n\n00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:10.734\nbut very much alive.\n\n00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:13.654\nAnd anything that is\nthat dry and still alive,\n\n00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:15.158\nwe call desiccation-tolerant.\n\n00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:17.214\nIn the desiccated state,\n\n00:04:17.238 -->

again.\n\n00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:56.814\nLike seeds, these are\ndesiccation-tolerant.\n\n00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:00.958\nLike seeds, these can withstand extremes\nof environmental conditions.\n\n00:06:01.718 --> 00:06:03.734\nAnd this is a really rare phenomenon.\n\n00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:08.134\nThere are only 135 flowering\nplant species that can do this.\n\n00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:09.574\nI'm going to show you a video\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.214\nof the resurrection process\nof these three species\n\n00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.454\nin that order.\n\n00:06:13.478 --> 00:06:14.734\nAnd at the bottom,\n\n00:06:14.758 --> 00:06:17.494\nthere's a time axis\nso you can see how quickly it happens.\n\n00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:58.158\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:03.734\nPretty amazing, huh?\n\n00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:07.974\nSo I've spent the last 21 years\ntrying to understand how they do this.\n\n00:07:07.998 --> 00:07:10.398\nHow do these plants dry without dying?\n\n00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:13.814\nAnd I work on a variety\nof different resurrection plants,\n\n00:07:13.838 --> 00:07:16.254\nshown here in the hydrated and dry states,\n\n00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:17.734\nfor a number of reasons.\n\n00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:20.614\nOne of them is that each\nof these plants serves as a model\n\n00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:23.014\nfor a crop that I'd like\nto make drought-tolerant.\n\n00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:25.974\nSo on the extreme top left,\nfor example, is a grass,\n\n00:07:25.998 --> 00:07:28.254\nit's called Eragrostis nindensis,\n\n00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:30.654\nit's got a close relative\ncalled Eragrostis tef --\n\n00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:32.694\na lot of you might know it as \"teff\" --\n\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.454\nit's a staple food in Ethiopia,\n\n00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:35.734\nit's gluten-free,\n\n00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:38.774\nand it's something we would like\nto make drought-tolerant.\n\n00:07:38.798 --> 00:07:41.214\nThe other reason for looking\nat a number of plants,\n\n00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:42.614\nis that, at least initially,\n\n00:07:42.638 --> 00:07:44.894\nI wanted to find out:\ndo they do the same thing?\n\n00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:46.614\nDo they all use the same mechanisms\n\n00:07:46.638 --> 00:07:49.214\nto be able to lose\nall that water and not die?\n\n00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:51.934\nSo I undertook what we call\na systems biology approach\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.134\nin order to get\na comprehensive understanding\n\n00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:56.174\nof desiccation tolerance,\n\n00:07:56.198 --> 00:07:57.654\nin which we look at everything\n\n00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.590\nfrom the molecular to the whole plant,\necophysiological level.\n\n00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:02.249\nFor example we look at things like\n\n00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:04.471\nchanges in the plant anatomy\nas they dried out\n\n00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:05.734\nand their ultrastructure.\n\n00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:08.934\nWe look at the transcriptome,\nwhich is just a term for a technology\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.374\nin which we look at the genes\n\n00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:12.814\nthat are switched on or off,\nin response to drying.\n\n00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:16.054\nMost genes will code for proteins,\nso we look at the proteome.\n\n00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:18.478\nWhat are the proteins made\nin response to drying?\n\n00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:23.334\nSome proteins would code for enzymes\nwhich make metabolites,\n\n00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:24.934\nso we look at the metabolome.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.254\nNow, this is important\nbecause plants are stuck in the ground.\n\n00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:32.374\nThey use what I call\na highly tuned chemical arsenal\n\n00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:35.814\nto protect themselves from all\nthe stresses of their environment.\n\n00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:37.334\nSo it's important that we look\n\n00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:39.798\nat the chemical changes\ninvolved in drying.\n\n00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.134\nAnd at the last study\nthat we do at the molecular level,\n\n00:08:43.158 --> 00:08:44.414\nwe look at the lipidome --\n\n00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.493\nthe lipid changes in response to drying.\n\n00:08:46.517 --> 00:08:47.774\nAnd that's also important\n\n00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:50.613\nbecause all biological membranes\nare made of lipids.\n\n00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:53.214\nThey're held as membranes\nbecause they're in water.\n\n00:08:53.238 --> 00:08:55.478\nTake away the water,\nthose membranes fall apart.\n\n00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:59.238\nLipids also act as signals\nto turn on genes.\n\n00:09:00.158 --> 00:09:02.854\nThen we use physiological\nand biochemical studies\n\n00:09:02.878 --> 00:09:06.094\nto try and understand\nthe function of the putative protectants\n\n00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:09.054\nthat we've actually discovered\nin our other studies.\n\n00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:11.254\nAnd then use all of that\nto try and understand\n\n00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:13.598\nhow the plant copes\nwith its natural environment.\n\n00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:19.774\nI've always had the philosophy that\nI needed a comprehensive understanding\n\n00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:22.054\nof the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance\n\n00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:25.918\nin order to make a meaningful suggestion\nfor a biotic application.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.614\nI'm sure some of you are thinking,\n\n00:09:28.638 --> 00:09:29.894\n\"By biotic application,\n\n00:09:29.918 --> 00:09:32.838\ndoes she mean she's going to make\ngenetically modified crops?\"\n\n00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.894\nAnd the answer to that question is:\n\n00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:38.299\ndepends on your definition\nof genetic modification.\n\n00:09:39.158 --> 00:09:41.974\nAll of the crops that we eat today,\nwheat, rice and maize,\n\n00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.214\nare highly genetically modified\nfrom their ancestors,\n\n00:09:45.238 --> 00:09:47.214\nbut we don't consider them GM\n\n00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:49.878\nbecause they're being produced\nby conventional breeding.\n\n00:09:50.838 --> 00:09:54.614\nIf you mean, am I going to put\nresurrection plant genes into crops,\n\n00:09:54.638 --> 00:09:55.934\nyour answer is yes.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.094\nIn the essence of time,\nwe have tried that approach.\n\n00:09:59.118 --> 00:10:01.974\nMore appropriately,\nsome of my collaborators at UCT,\n\n00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:03.934\nJennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.574\nhave spearheaded that approach\n\n00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:07.551\nand I'm going to show you some data soon.\n\n00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:13.174\nBut we're about to embark\nupon an extremely ambitious approach,\n\n00:10:13.198 --> 00:10:16.654\nin which we aim to turn on\nwhole suites of genes\n\n00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:19.374\nthat are already present in every crop.\n\n00:10:19.398 --> 00:10:22.303\nThey're just never turned on\nunder extreme drought conditions.\n\n00:10:22.758 --> 00:10:24.214\nI leave it up to you to decide\n\n00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.191\nwhether those should be called GM or not.\n\n00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:30.974\nI'm going to now just give you\nsome of the data from that first approach.\n\n00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.254\nAnd in order to do that\n\n00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:34.934\nI have to explain a little bit\nabout how genes work.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.214\nSo you probably all know\n\n00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:38.294\nthat genes are made\nof double-stranded DNA.\n\n00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:40.254\nIt's wound very tightly into chromosomes\n\n00:10:40.278 --> 00:10:43.438\nthat are present in every cell\nof your body or in a plant's body.\n\n00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:47.118\nIf you unwind that DNA, you get genes.\n\n00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:50.254\nAnd each gene has a promoter,\n\n00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:52.654\nwhich is just an on-off switch,\n\n00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:54.094\nthe gene coding region,\n\n00:10:54.118 --> 00:10:55.374\nand then a terminator,\n\n00:10:55.398 --> 00:10:58.998\nwhich indicates that this is the end\nof this gene, the next gene will start.\n\n00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.574\nNow, promoters are not\nsimple on-off switches.\n\n00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:05.294\nThey normally require\na lot of fine-tuning,\n\n00:11:05.318 --> 00:11:09.358\nlots of things to be present and correct\nbefore that gene is switched on.\n\n00:11:10.198 --> 00:11:13.254\nSo what's typically done\nin biotech studies\n\n00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:15.094\nis that we use an inducible promoter,\n\n00:11:15.118 --> 00:11:16.694\nwe know how to switch it on.\n\n00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.734\nWe couple that to genes of interest\n\n00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:21.438\nand put that into a plant\nand see how the plant responds.\n\n00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:24.654\nIn the study that I'm going\nto talk to you about,\n\n00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:27.134\nmy collaborators used\na drought-induced promoter,\n\n00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:29.574\nwhich we discovered\nin a resurrection plant.\n\n00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:32.734\nThe nice thing about this promoter\nis that we do nothing.\n\n00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.838\nThe plant itself senses drought.\n\n00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:40.654\nAnd we've used it to drive antioxidant\ngenes from resurrection plants.\n\n00:11:40.678 --> 00:11:42.534\nWhy antioxidant genes?\n\n00:11:42.558 --> 00:11:45.614\nWell, all stresses,\nparticularly drought stress,\n\n00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:47.934\nresults in the formation of free radicals,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.294\nor reactive oxygen species,\n\n00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:53.038\nwhich are highly damaging\nand can cause crop death.\n\n00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:56.238\nWhat antioxidants do is stop that damage.\n\n00:11:57.318 --> 00:12:01.214\nSo here's some data from a maize strain\nthat's very popularly used in Africa.\n\n00:12:01.238 --> 00:12:04.534\nTo the left of the arrow\nare plants without the genes,\n\n00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:05.814\nto the right --\n\n00:12:05.838 --> 00:12:07.894\nplants with the antioxidant genes.\n\n00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:09.734\nAfter three weeks without watering,\n\n00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:12.238\nthe ones with the genes\ndo a hell of a lot better.\n\n00:12:13.678 --> 00:12:15.014\nNow to the final approach.\n\n00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:18.574\nMy research has shown\nthat there's considerable similarity\n\n00:12:18.598 --> 00:12:23.014\nin the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance\nin seeds and resurrection plants.\n\n00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:24.454\nSo I ask the question,\n\n00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:25.918\nare they using the same genes?\n\n00:12:26.438 --> 00:12:28.694\nOr slightly differently phrased,\n\n00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:33.214\nare resurrection plants using genes\nevolved in seed desiccation tolerance\n\n00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:34.494\nin their roots and leaves?\n\n00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.574\nHave they retasked these seed genes\n\n00:12:36.598 --> 00:12:38.638\nin roots and leaves\nof resurrection plants?\n\n00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.574\nAnd I answer that question,\n\n00:12:41.598 --> 00:12:44.014\nas a consequence of a lot\nof research from my group\n\n00:12:44.038 --> 00:12:47.574\nand recent collaborations from a group\nof Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,\n\n00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:49.174\nMel Oliver in the United States\n\n00:12:49.198 --> 00:12:51.798\nand Julia Buitink in France.\n\n00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.254\nThe answer is yes,\n\n00:12:53.278 --> 00:12:56.134\nthat there is a core set of genes\nthat are involved in both.\n\n00:12:56.158 --> 00:12:59.574\nAnd I'm going to illustrate this\nvery crudely for maize,\n\n00:12:59.598 --> 00:13:02.014\nwhere the chromosomes below the off switch\n\n00:13:02.038 --> 00:13:05.613\nrepresent all the genes that are required\nfor desiccation tolerance.\n\n00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:09.894\nSo as maize seeds dried out\nat the end of their period of development,\n\n00:13:09.918 --> 00:13:11.278\nthey switch these genes on.\n\n00:13:12.638 --> 00:13:15.534\nResurrection plants\nswitch on the same genes\n\n00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:17.214\nwhen they dry out.\n\n00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:19.014\nAll modern crops, therefore,\n\n00:13:19.038 --> 00:13:21.094\nhave these genes\nin their roots and leaves,\n\n00:13:21.118 --> 00:13:22.854\nthey just never switch them on.\n\n00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:24.838\nThey only switch them on in seed tissues.\n\n00:13:25.398 --> 00:13:27.134\nSo what we're trying to do right now\n\n00:13:27.158 --> 00:13:29.774\nis to understand the environmental\nand cellular signals\n\n00:13:29.798 --> 00:13:32.238\nthat switch on these genes\nin resurrection plants,\n\n00:13:33.238 --> 00:13:34.998\nto mimic the process in crops.\n\n00:13:35.638 --> 00:13:37.374\nAnd just a final thought.\n\n00:13:37.398 --> 00:13:39.614\nWhat we're trying to do very rapidly\n\n00:13:39.638 --> 00:13:43.454\nis to repeat what nature did\nin the evolution of resurrection plants\n\n00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:45.318\nsome 10 to 40 million years ago.\n\n00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:48.614\nMy plants and I thank you\nfor your attention.\n\n00:13:48.638 --> 00:13:54.873\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Can a computer write poetry?", "duration": "656", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/oscar_schwartz_can_a_computer_write_poetry", "transcript": "I have a question. Can a computer write poetry? This is a provocative question. You think about it for a minute, and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like: What is a computer? What is poetry? What is creativity? But these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer, not in a single TED Talk. So we're going to have to try a different approach.So up here, we have two poems. One of them is written by a human, and the other one's written by a computer. I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which. Have a go:Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away. Am I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?Poem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning / Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)Alright, time's up. Hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human. OK, most of you. Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human. Very brave of you, because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake. The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically, according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on. So let's try another test. Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut.Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating that a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful! Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)Alright, time's up. So if you think the first poem was written by a human, put your hand up. OK. And if you think the second poem was written by a human, put your hand up. We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here. It was much harder.The answer is, the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter, that was created back in the 1970s, and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara, who happens to be one of my favorite human poets.(Laughter)So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry. The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950, in order to answer the question, can computers think? Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human, with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human, then the computer can be said to have intelligence.So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online. It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves. But basically, it's the game we just played. You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess. So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online, so we have results.And what are the results? Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test for intelligence. We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human. So, I think we have an answer to our question. According to the logic of the Turing test, can a computer write poetry? Well, yes, absolutely it can. But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer, that's OK. If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it, that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.Let's play our third and final test. Again, you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human.Poem 1: Red flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons. Ribbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...)Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; / 'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...)OK, time is up. So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human. Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human. Whoa, that's a lot more people. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein. And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP. Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply, how RKCP works. So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence. So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text.So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using. The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day. It's just raw material. And nevertheless, it's able to create a poem that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem, and Gertrude Stein is a human.So what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test. So Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer. Therefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test, Gertrude Stein is a computer.(Laughter)Feeling confused? I think that's fair enough.So far we've had humans that write like humans, we have computers that write like computers, we have computers that write like humans, but we also have, perhaps most confusingly, humans that write like computers.So what do we take from all of this? Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein? Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?(Laughter)These are questions I've been asking myself for around two years now, and I don't have any answers. But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology.So my first insight is that, for some reason, we associate poetry with being human. So that when we ask, \"Can a computer write poetry?\" we're also asking, \"What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category? How do we say who or what can be part of this category?\" This is an essentially philosophical question, I believe, and it can't be answered with a yes or no test, like the Turing test. I also believe that Alan Turing understood this, and that when he devised his test back in 1950, he was doing it as a philosophical provocation.So my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry, we're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms, they're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s. What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather, is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness. So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earlier today, we say that William Blake is more of a human than Gertrude Stein. Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer. It simply means that the category of the human is unstable. This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact. Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time.So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us. We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us. We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein. More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently. And much of the conversation is, can we build it? Can we build an intelligent computer? Can we build a creative computer? What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer?But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time. So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, \"Can we build it?\" But we should also be asking ourselves, \"What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?\" This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered with software alone, but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2411, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.069\nI have a question.\n\n00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.323\nCan a computer write poetry?\n\n00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:20.994\nThis is a provocative question.\n\n00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.391\nYou think about it for a minute,\n\n00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:26.005\nand you suddenly have a bunch\nof other questions like:\n\n00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.108\nWhat is a computer?\n\n00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:30.243\nWhat is poetry?\n\n00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:32.354\nWhat is creativity?\n\n00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:34.780\nBut these are questions\n\n00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.874\nthat people spend their entire\nlifetime trying to answer,\n\n00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:40.122\nnot in a single TED Talk.\n\n00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:42.591\nSo we're going to have to try\na different approach.\n\n00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:44.758\nSo up here, we have two poems.\n\n00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:48.073\nOne of them is written by a human,\n\n00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:50.199\nand the other one's written by a computer.\n\n00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:53.122\nI'm going to ask you to tell me\nwhich one's which.\n\n00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:54.972\nHave a go:\n\n00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:59.052\nPoem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, /\nMy thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.\n\n00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:02.470\nAm I not / A fly like thee? /\nOr art not thou / A man like me?\n\n00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:05.793\nPoem 2: We can feel / Activist\nthrough your life's / morning /\n\n00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:10.064\nPauses to see, pope I hate the / Non\nall the night to start a / great otherwise (...)\n\n00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:11.447\nAlright, time's up.\n\n00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:15.567\nHands up if you think Poem 1\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:18.995\nOK, most of you.\n\n00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:22.042\nHands up if you think Poem 2\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.320\nVery brave of you,\n\n00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:29.098\nbecause the first one was written\nby the human poet William Blake.\n\n00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:32.691\nThe second one was written by an algorithm\n\n00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:36.407\nthat took all the language\nfrom my Facebook feed on one day\n\n00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.194\nand then regenerated it algorithmically,\n\n00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:42.808\naccording to methods that I'll describe\na little bit later on.\n\n00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:45.580\nSo let's try another test.\n\n00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.449\nAgain, you haven't got ages to read this,\n\n00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:50.085\nso just trust your gut.\n\n00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.154\nPoem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks.\nIt is interesting / and fascinating\n\n00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:58.481\nthat a bird will fly and not / roar\nor bark.

hands up if you think Poem 1\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:54.969\nHands up if you think Poem 2\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.324\nWhoa, that's a lot more people.\n\n00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:01.253\nSo you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1\n\n00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:05.270\nwas written by the very\nhuman poet Gertrude Stein.\n\n00:05:06.058 --> 00:05:11.096\nAnd Poem 2 was generated\nby an algorithm called RKCP.\n\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.439\nNow before we go on, let me describe\nvery quickly and simply,\n\n00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:16.244\nhow RKCP works.\n\n00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:20.681\nSo RKCP is an algorithm\ndesigned by Ray Kurzweil,\n\n00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:22.927\nwho's a director of engineering at Google\n\n00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:25.311\nand a firm believer\nin artificial intelligence.\n\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.771\nSo, you give RKCP a source text,\n\n00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:34.264\nit analyzes the source text in order\nto find out how it uses language,\n\n00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:36.236\nand then it regenerates language\n\n00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.788\nthat emulates that first text.\n\n00:05:38.812 --> 00:05:40.925\nSo in the poem we just saw before,\n\n00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.574\nPoem 2, the one that you all\nthought was human,\n\n00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:45.148\nit was fed a bunch of poems\n\n00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:47.207\nby a poet called Emily Dickinson\n\n00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:49.420\nit looked at the way she used language,\n\n00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:50.609\nlearned the model,\n\n00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:54.891\nand then it regenerated a model\naccording to that same structure.\n\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.868\nBut the important thing to know about RKCP\n\n00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:01.730\nis that it doesn't know the meaning\nof the words it's using.\n\n00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:04.593\nThe language is just raw material,\n\n00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:06.777\nit could be Chinese,\nit could be in Swedish,\n\n00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.980\nit could be the collected language\nfrom your Facebook feed for one day.\n\n00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:12.656\nIt's just raw material.\n\n00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:16.035\nAnd nevertheless, it's able\nto create a poem\n\n00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.386\nthat seems more human\nthan Gertrude Stein's poem,\n\n00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.563\nand Gertrude Stein is a human.\n\n00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:26.876\nSo what we've done here is,\nmore or less, a reverse Turing test.\n\n00:06:27.898 --> 00:06:33.077\nSo Gertrude Stein, who's a human,\nis able to write a poem\n\n00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.839\nthat fools a majority\nof human judges into thinking\n\n00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:38.689\nthat it was written by a computer.\n\n00:06:39.134 --> 00:06:43.275\nTherefore, according to the logic\nof the reverse Turing test,\n\n00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:45.215\nGertrude Stein is a computer.\n\n00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:46.701\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:48.610\nFeeling confused?\n\n00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:50.666\nI think that's fair enough.\n\n00:06:51.504 --> 00:06:55.620\nSo far we've had humans\nthat write like humans,\n\n00:06:55.644 --> 00:06:58.755\nwe have computers that write\nlike computers,\n\n00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.834\nwe have computers that write like humans,\n\n00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:05.490\nbut we also have,\nperhaps most confusingly,\n\n00:07:05.514 --> 00:07:07.889\nhumans that write like computers.\n\n00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.662\nSo what do we take from all of this?\n\n00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.726\nDo we take that William Blake\nis somehow more of a human\n\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.999\nthan Gertrude Stein?\n\n00:07:16.023 --> 00:07:19.069\nOr that Gertrude Stein is more\nof a computer than William Blake?\n\n00:07:19.093 --> 00:07:20.645\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:22.992\nThese are questions\nI've been asking myself\n\n00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:24.481\nfor around two years now,\n\n00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:26.814\nand I don't have any answers.\n\n00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:29.168\nBut what I do have are a bunch of insights\n\n00:07:29.192 --> 00:07:31.726\nabout our relationship with technology.\n\n00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:36.566\nSo my first insight is that,\nfor some reason,\n\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.701\nwe associate poetry with being human.\n\n00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:43.870\nSo that when we ask,\n\"Can a computer write poetry?\"\n\n00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:45.087\nwe're also asking,\n\n00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.909\n\"What does it mean to be human\n\n00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:50.105\nand how do we put boundaries\naround this category?\n\n00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:53.787\nHow do we say who or what\ncan be part of this category?\"\n\n00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:57.685\nThis is an essentially\nphilosophical question, I believe,\n\n00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.938\nand it can't be answered\nwith a yes or no test,\n\n00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:01.289\nlike the Turing test.\n\n00:08:01.763 --> 00:08:04.808\nI also believe that Alan Turing\nunderstood this,\n\n00:08:04.832 --> 00:08:08.137\nand that when he devised\nhis test back in 1950,\n\n00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:10.963\nhe was doing it\nas a philosophical provocation.\n\n00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:18.623\nSo my second insight is that,\nwhen we take the Turing test for poetry,\n\n00:08:18.647 --> 00:08:22.107\nwe're not really testing\nthe capacity of the computers\n\n00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:25.024\nbecause poetry-generating algorithms,\n\n00:08:25.048 --> 00:08:29.611\nthey're pretty simple and have existed,\nmore or less, since the 1950s.\n\n00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:34.131\nWhat we are doing with the Turing\ntest for poetry, rather,\n\n00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:38.770\nis collecting opinions about what\nconstitutes humanness.\n\n00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:43.000\nSo, what I've figured out,\n\n00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:45.996\nwe've seen this when earlier today,\n\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.498\nwe say that William Blake\nis more of a human\n\n00:08:48.522 --> 00:08:50.087\nthan Gertrude Stein.\n\n00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:52.573\nOf course, this doesn't mean\nthat William Blake\n\n00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:54.425\nwas actually more human\n\n00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:56.776\nor that Gertrude Stein\nwas more of a computer.\n\n00:08:57.491 --> 00:09:02.205\nIt simply means that the category\nof the human is unstable.\n\n00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:05.482\nThis has led me to understand\n\n00:09:05.506 --> 00:09:08.269\nthat the human is not a cold, hard fact.\n\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.922\nRather, it is something\nthat's constructed with our opinions\n\n00:09:11.946 --> 00:09:14.801\nand something that changes over time.\n\n00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:21.108\nSo my final insight is that\nthe computer, more or less,\n\n00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:25.138\nworks like a mirror\nthat reflects any idea of a human\n\n00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:26.537\nthat we show it.\n\n00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:28.800\nWe show it Emily Dickinson,\n\n00:09:28.824 --> 00:09:31.145\nit gives Emily Dickinson back to us.\n\n00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:33.560\nWe show it William Blake,\n\n00:09:33.584 --> 00:09:35.869\nthat's what it reflects back to us.\n\n00:09:35.893 --> 00:09:37.732\nWe show it Gertrude Stein,\n\n00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:40.226\nwhat we get back is Gertrude Stein.\n\n00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.409\nMore than any other bit of technology,\n\n00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:48.598\nthe computer is a mirror that reflects\nany idea of the human we teach it.\n\n00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:52.306\nSo I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing\n\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.192\na lot about artificial\nintelligence recently.\n\n00:09:56.652 --> 00:09:59.482\nAnd much of the conversation is,\n\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.439\ncan we build it?\n\n00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:05.476\nCan we build an intelligent computer?\n\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.263\nCan we build a creative computer?\n\n00:10:08.287 --> 00:10:10.400\nWhat we seem to be asking over and over\n\n00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:13.148\nis can we build a human-like computer?\n\n00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.475\nBut what we've seen just now\n\n00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:18.587\nis that the human\nis not a scientific fact,\n\n00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:22.141\nthat it's an ever-shifting,\nconcatenating idea\n\n00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:24.696\nand one that changes over time.\n\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.872\nSo that when we begin\nto grapple with the ideas\n\n00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:30.282\nof artificial intelligence in the future,\n\n00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:32.211\nwe shouldn't only be asking ourselves,\n\n00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:33.603\n\"Can we build it?\"\n\n00:10:33.627 --> 00:10:35.521\nBut we should also be asking ourselves,\n\n00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:39.258\n\"What idea of the human\ndo we want to have reflected back to us?\"\n\n00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:42.471\nThis is an essentially philosophical idea,\n\n00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:45.492\nand it's one that can't be answered\nwith software alone,\n\n00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:50.493\nbut I think requires a moment\nof species-wide, existential reflection.\n\n00:10:50.998 --> 00:10:52.151\nThank you.\n\n00:10:52.175 -->

representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria, communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed; communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered: fishing, marine transportation and trading; communities where fish yields have diminished; communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days, sometimes weeks, on end. Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities.The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes. Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths. In some places, the plant is called Babangida. When you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups. And you think: fear, restraint. In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola. When you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections and you think: dashed hopes. In the southwestern part of Nigeria, the plant is known as Gbe'borun. Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to \"gossip,\" or \"talebearer.\" When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction. And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria, the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma, And when you hear that, you think of death. It literally translates to \"death to mother and child.\"I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009. It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria. I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith, a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development. And so here I was in the year 2009, actually, at the end of 2009, in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image. It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth. And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself, \"These poor fisherfolk, how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions.\" And then I thought, \"There's got to be a better way.\" A win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the weeds being cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed. That, I would say, was my spark moment.And so I did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed. Out of the several, one struck me the most. It was the use of the plant for handicrafts. And I thought, \"What a great idea.\" Personally, I love handicrafts, especially handicrafts that are woven around a story. And so I thought, \"This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills.\" And I thought to myself, \"Three simple steps to a mega solution.\"First step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth. That way, you create access.Secondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems.And thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products.The third step was a challenge. See, I'm a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts. And so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave.And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived, called Sabo. Sabo translates to \"strangers' quarters.\" And the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country. So I literally took my dried weeds in hand, there were several more of them, and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes. And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya. The problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English and neither did I speak Hausa. But some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate. And that began my journey of learning how to weave and transform these dried water hyacinth stems into long ropes.With my long ropes in hand, I was now equipped to make products. And that was the beginning of partnerships. Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products. So with this in hand, I felt confident that I would be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity. So taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold. So we have pens, we have tableware, we have purses, we have tissue boxes. Thereby, helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light. Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable, being aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient. Changing names, changing livelihoods.From Gbe'borun, gossip, to Olusotan, storyteller. And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is \"killer of mother and child,\" to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma, \"provider of food for mother and child.\"And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis. He said, \"If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories. And if you want to change a culture, change the stories.\"And so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi, to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba, we have changed the story.Thank you for listening.(Applause)",

00:05:34.718\ninto long ropes.\n\n00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:37.614\nWith my long ropes in hand,\n\n00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:40.734\nI was now equipped to make products.\n\n00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:43.174\nAnd that was the beginning\nof partnerships.\n\n00:05:43.198 --> 00:05:47.174\nWorking with rattan basket makers\nto come up with products.\n\n00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:49.974\nSo with this in hand, I felt confident\n\n00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:51.998\nthat I would be able\nto take this knowledge\n\n00:05:52.022 --> 00:05:54.574\nback into the riverine communities\n\n00:05:54.598 -->

story of the Sistine Chapel", "duration": "1053", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_lev_the_unheard_story_of_the_sistine_chapel", "transcript": "Imagine you're in Rome, and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums. And you've been shuffling down long corridors, past statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff. You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel. At last \u2014 a long corridor, a stair and a door. You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.So what are you expecting? Soaring domes? Choirs of angels? We don't really have any of that there. Instead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel. And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains, the original decoration of this chapel. Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses, but as a way to represent the great theater of life. The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story, a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.Now, this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy, educated Christian priests. They prayed there. They elected their pope there. Five hundred years ago, it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave. So, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year, from all different backgrounds? Because in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion, ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers, which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history.Now, this development took place as a great evolution, moving from the beginning of a few elite, and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world. This evolution took place in three stages, each one linked to a historical circumstance. The first one was rather limited in scope. It reflected the rather parochial perspective. The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage; and the third, when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global.The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world. There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses, reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people. The man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV, assembled a dream team of Florentine art, including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher, Ghirlandaio. These men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color, and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes, the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story, something much more familiar. With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family, this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent. But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well. And it did, thanks to a creative genius, a visionary and an awesome story.Now, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti, 33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling, and the deck was stacked against him \u2014 he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture. There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions, lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project, and that project had fallen through. And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which would look like every other ceiling in Italy.But genius rose to the challenge. In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters. He, too, would tell a story \u2014 no Apostles \u2014 but a story of great beginnings, the story of Genesis.Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling. How would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below? The painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter, and so he played to his strengths. Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness, he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within. Michelangelo was an essentialist; he would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II, a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius. He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV, and he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power. And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope, but this man's legacy to the Vatican \u2014 it wasn't fortresses and artillery, it was art. He left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel. He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures \u2014 decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums. Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty, and he was right. The encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II, that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo was so committed to this project, that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years, using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end, reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global. No more familiar artistic references to the world around you. There's just space and structure and energy; a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels, more driven by sculptural form than painterly color. And we stand in the far end by the entrance, far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning. And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition, we think in terms of a primal spark. Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark, a churning figure blurry in the distance, compressed into a tight space. The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next. He leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation. Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created, unlike all the other artists. He focused on the act of creation.And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers. So what's he doing? Is he creating land? Is he creating sea? Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, \"It is good.\"So now the scene is set, and you get to the culmination of creation, which is man. Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background. But looking closer, that leg is pretty languid on the ground, the arm is heavy on the knee. Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness. That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger, which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam. It puts us at the edge of our seats, because we're one moment from that contact, through which that man will discover his purpose, leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.And then Michelangelo threw a curveball. Who is in that other arm? Eve, first woman. No, she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan. She's always been in his mind. Look at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm. And for me, an American art historian from the 21st century, this was the moment that the painting spoke to me. Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women \u2014 so much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling, is the creation of woman, not Adam. And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden, they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame.You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling. You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church. The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum, and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve. The remaining scenes in the ceiling, they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us. You have Noah and his Ark and the flood. You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God. Maybe he's the savior. Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine, got drunk and passed out naked in his barn. It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn. And so, compared with Adam, you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah. Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination, with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade. You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers. They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling, the culmination of the whole thing, with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space, encroaching our space.This is the most important juncture. Past meets present. This figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale, for the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice, but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day, he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall, where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment, painted in 1534 after the world had changed again. The Reformation had splintered the Church, the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean. How is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world? Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, that universal desire, common to all of us, to leave a legacy of excellence. Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment, the end of the world, Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies. They have no more covers, no more portraits except for a couple. It's a composition only out of bodies, 391, no two alike, unique like each and every one of us. They start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground, struggling and trying to rise. Those who have risen reach back to help others, and in one amazing vignette, you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world. The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle. There you find men and women completely nude like athletes. They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles \u2014 they're just like athletes. So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight. Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven. And as Michelangelo proved in his painting, hardship, setbacks and obstacles, they don't limit excellence, they forge it.Now, this does lead us to one odd thing. This is the Pope's private chapel, and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes. But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language, the most universal artistic language he could think of: that of the human body. And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery, he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power.Now, one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy. And so it did. Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press, complaints about the nudity spread all over the place, and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography, at which point he added two more portraits, one of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier, and the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete, in the hands of a long-suffering martyr. The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over, a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.And so now we stand in the here and now. We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings, in the great, huge totality of the human experience. The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror. Who am I in this picture? Am I one of the crowd? Am I the drunk guy? Am I the athlete? And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty, we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions: Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography, too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time. But actually the story is bigger. It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures. This work of art was almost destroyed because of that.Elizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous. The printing press made sure that everybody saw it. And so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks. It was something that happened over the space of 20 years of editorials and complaints, saying to the Church, \"You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives. Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?\" And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing. That's where it all came about, and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art, not indeed deface or destroyed it.BG: This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel.(Laughter)EL: I don't know, is that an ad?(Laughter)BG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement. The experience of art today is encountering problems. Too many people want to see this there, and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did.EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look. But also realize, even when you're in those days, with 28,000 people a day, even those days when you're in there with all those other people, look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from 500 years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you, looking upwards with their jaws dropped. It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space.BG: Liz, grazie.EL: Grazie a te.BG: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2415, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.645\nImagine you're in Rome,\n\n00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.872\nand you've made your way\nto the Vatican Museums.\n\n00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.502\nAnd you've been shuffling\ndown long corridors,\n\n00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:25.966\npast statues, frescoes,\nlots and lots of stuff.\n\n00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.683\nYou're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:34.083\nAt last -- a long corridor,\na stair and a door.\n\n00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:37.105\nYou're at the threshold\nof the Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.893\nSo what are you expecting?\n\n00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:41.441\nSoaring domes?

Buonarroti,\n\n00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.129\n33 years old when he was tapped\nto decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,\n\n00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:01.034\nand the deck was stacked against him --\n\n00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:03.954\nhe had trained in painting\nbut had left to pursue sculpture.\n\n00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:07.436\nThere were angry patrons in Florence\nbecause he had left a stack\n\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.134\nof incomplete commissions,\n\n00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:12.821\nlured to Rome by the prospect\nof a great sculptural project,\n\n00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:15.426\nand that project had fallen through.\n\n00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.579\nAnd he had been left with a commission\nto paint 12 apostles\n\n00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:21.524\nagainst a decorative background\nin the Sistine Chapel ceiling,\n\n00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:25.086\nwhich would look like\nevery other ceiling in Italy.\n\n00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:27.404\nBut genius rose to the challenge.\n\n00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:30.926\nIn an age when a man dared\nto sail across the Atlantic Ocean,\n\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.478\nMichelangelo dared to chart\nnew artistic waters.\n\n00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:37.221\nHe, too, would tell a story --\n\n00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:40.777\nno Apostles -- but a story\nof great beginnings,\n\n00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.473\nthe story of Genesis.\n\n00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:45.976\nNot really an easy sell,\nstories on a ceiling.\n\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.808\nHow would you be able to read\na busy scene from 62 feet below?\n\n00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.687\nThe painting technique that had been\nhanded on for 200 years\n\n00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:57.025\nin Florentine studios was not equipped\nfor this kind of a narrative.\n\n00:04:57.652 --> 00:05:00.620\nBut Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,\n\n00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:02.928\nand so he played to his strengths.\n\n00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:06.434\nInstead of being accustomed\nto filling space with busyness,\n\n00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:10.257\nhe took a hammer and chisel\nand hacked away at a piece of marble\n\n00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:12.711\nto reveal the figure within.\n\n00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.903\nMichelangelo was an essentialist;\n\n00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:19.313\nhe would tell his story\nin massive, dynamic bodies.\n\n00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:24.104\nThis plan was embraced\nby the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,\n\n00:05:24.128 --> 00:05:27.749\na man who was unafraid\nof Michelangelo's brazen genius.\n\n00:05:27.773 --> 00:05:29.655\nHe was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,\n\n00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.786\nand he had been steeped in art\nfor 30 years and he knew its power.\n\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.874\nAnd history has handed down the moniker\nof the Warrior Pope,\n\n00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:40.688\nbut this man's legacy to the Vatican --\nit wasn't fortresses and artillery,\n\n00:05:40.712 --> 00:05:42.028\nit was art.\n\n00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:44.631\nHe left us the Raphael Rooms,\nthe Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:05:44.655 --> 00:05:46.300\nHe left St. Peter's Basilica\n\n00:05:46.324 --> 00:05:52.027\nas well as an extraordinary collection\nof Greco-Roman sculptures --\n\n00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:56.191\ndecidedly un-Christian works\nthat would become the seedbed\n\n00:05:56.215 --> 00:06:00.100\nof the world's first modern museum,\nthe Vatican Museums.\n\n00:06:00.805 --> 00:06:02.229\nJulius was a man\n\n00:06:02.253 --> 00:06:06.037\nwho envisioned a Vatican\nthat would be eternally relevant\n\n00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.150\nthrough grandeur and through beauty,\n\n00:06:08.174 --> 00:06:09.546\nand he was right.\n\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.558\nThe encounter between these two giants,\nMichelangelo and Julius II,\n\n00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:17.019\nthat's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.386\nMichelangelo was so committed\nto this project,\n\n00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.793\nthat he succeeded in getting the job done\nin three and a half years,\n\n00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:29.086\nusing a skeleton crew and spending\nmost of the time, hours on end,\n\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.801\nreaching up above his head\nto paint the stories on the ceiling.\n\n00:06:33.382 --> 00:06:35.432\nSo let's look at this ceiling\n\n00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:38.287\nand see storytelling gone global.\n\n00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:42.723\nNo more familiar artistic references\nto the world around you.\n\n00:06:42.747 --> 00:06:47.390\nThere's just space\nand structure and energy;\n\n00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:52.011\na monumental painted framework\nwhich opens onto nine panels,\n\n00:06:52.035 --> 00:06:55.968\nmore driven by sculptural form\nthan painterly color.\n\n00:06:55.992 --> 00:06:59.769\nAnd we stand in the far end\nby the entrance,\n\n00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:03.899\nfar from the altar and from the gated\nenclosure intended for the clergy\n\n00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:09.170\nand we peer into the distance,\nlooking for a beginning.\n\n00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:13.210\nAnd whether in scientific inquiry\nor in biblical tradition,\n\n00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:16.554\nwe think in terms of a primal spark.\n\n00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:18.711\nMichelangelo gave us an initial energy\n\n00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.476\nwhen he gave us the separation\nof light and dark,\n\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.889\na churning figure blurry in the distance,\n\n00:07:24.913 --> 00:07:27.397\ncompressed into a tight space.\n\n00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:29.750\nThe next figure looms larger,\n\n00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:33.201\nand you see a figure hurtling\nfrom one side to the next.\n\n00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:38.211\nHe leaves in his wake\nthe sun, the moon, vegetation.\n\n00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:42.242\nMichelangelo didn't focus\non the stuff that was being created,\n\n00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:44.310\nunlike all the other artists.\n\n00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:47.677\nHe focused on the act of creation.\n\n00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:52.075\nAnd then the movement stops,\nlike a caesura in poetry\n\n00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:53.351\nand the creator hovers.\n\n00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:54.654\nSo what's he doing?\n\n00:07:54.678 --> 00:07:57.533\nIs he creating land? Is he creating sea?\n\n00:07:57.557 --> 00:08:02.248\nOr is he looking back over his handiwork,\nthe universe and his treasures,\n\n00:08:02.272 --> 00:08:04.003\njust like Michelangelo must have,\n\n00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:06.624\nlooking back over his work in the ceiling\n\n00:08:06.648 --> 00:08:09.442\nand proclaiming, \"It is good.\"\n\n00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:12.451\nSo now the scene is set,\n\n00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:16.153\nand you get to the culmination\nof creation, which is man.\n\n00:08:16.177 --> 00:08:20.507\nAdam leaps to the eye, a light figure\nagainst a dark background.\n\n00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:22.289\nBut looking closer,\n\n00:08:22.313 --> 00:08:24.965\nthat leg is pretty languid on the ground,\n\n00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:27.279\nthe arm is heavy on the knee.\n\n00:08:27.303 --> 00:08:30.980\nAdam lacks that interior spark\n\n00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:33.292\nthat will impel him to greatness.\n\n00:08:33.316 --> 00:08:38.081\nThat spark is about to be conferred\nby the creator in that finger,\n\n00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:40.776\nwhich is one millimeter\nfrom the hand of Adam.\n\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.745\nIt puts us at the edge of our seats,\n\n00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:45.784\nbecause we're one moment\nfrom that contact,\n\n00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:48.709\nthrough which that man\nwill discover his purpose,\n\n00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:51.717\nleap up and take his place\nat the pinnacle of creation.\n\n00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:55.002\nAnd then Michelangelo threw a curveball.\n\n00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:56.854\nWho is in that other arm?\n\n00:08:57.489 --> 00:08:59.185\nEve, first woman.\n\n00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:02.118\nNo, she's not an afterthought.\nShe's part of the plan.\n\n00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.615\nShe's always been in his mind.\n\n00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:08.844\nLook at her, so intimate with God\nthat her hand curls around his arm.\n\n00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:14.695\nAnd for me, an American art historian\nfrom the 21st century,\n\n00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:17.571\nthis was the moment\nthat the painting spoke to me.\n\n00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:20.943\nBecause I realized that this\nrepresentation of the human drama\n\n00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:23.880\nwas always about men and women --\n\n00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:27.694\nso much so, that the dead center,\nthe heart of the ceiling,\n\n00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:30.132\nis the creation of woman, not Adam.\n\n00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:34.080\nAnd the fact is, that when you see them\ntogether in the Garden of Eden,\n\n00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:35.641\nthey fall together\n\n00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:40.057\nand together their proud posture\nturns into folded shame.\n\n00:09:40.605 --> 00:09:43.274\nYou are at critical juncture\nnow in the ceiling.\n\n00:09:43.298 --> 00:09:46.381\nYou are exactly at the point\nwhere you and I can go\n\n00:09:46.405 --> 00:09:47.860\nno further into the church.\n\n00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:51.240\nThe gated enclosure keeps us\nout of the inner sanctum,\n\n00:09:51.264 --> 00:09:53.777\nand we are cast out\nmuch like Adam and Eve.\n\n00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.557\nThe remaining scenes in the ceiling,\n\n00:09:55.581 --> 00:09:58.425\nthey mirror the crowded chaos\nof the world around us.\n\n00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:00.673\nYou have Noah and his Ark and the flood.\n\n00:10:00.697 --> 00:10:04.287\nYou have Noah. He's making a sacrifice\nand a covenant with God.\n\n00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:05.597\nMaybe he's the savior.\n\n00:10:05.989 --> 00:10:09.721\nOh, but no, Noah is the one\nwho grew grapes, invented wine,\n\n00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:11.903\ngot drunk and passed out\nnaked in his barn.\n\n00:10:12.343 --> 00:10:14.717\nIt is a curious way to design the ceiling,\n\n00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:16.665\nnow starting out with God creating life,\n\n00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:19.184\nending up with some guy\nblind drunk in a barn.\n\n00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:21.664\nAnd so, compared with Adam,\n\n00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:24.206\nyou might think Michelangelo\nis making fun of us.\n\n00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:26.694\nBut he's about to dispel the gloom\n\n00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.236\nby using those bright colors\nright underneath Noah:\n\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.650\nemerald, topaz, scarlet\non the prophet Zechariah.\n\n00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.653\nZechariah foresees a light\ncoming from the east,\n\n00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:40.365\nand we are turned at this juncture\nto a new destination,\n\n00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:44.264\nwith sibyls and prophets\nwho will lead us on a parade.\n\n00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:47.586\nYou have the heroes and heroines\nwho make safe the way,\n\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.094\nand we follow the mothers and fathers.\n\n00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:54.203\nThey are the motors of this great\nhuman engine, driving it forward.\n\n00:10:54.227 --> 00:10:57.134\nAnd now we're at the keystone\nof the ceiling,\n\n00:10:57.158 --> 00:10:59.337\nthe culmination of the whole thing,\n\n00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:02.591\nwith a figure that looks like\nhe's about to fall out of his space\n\n00:11:02.615 --> 00:11:03.955\ninto our space,\n\n00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:05.262\nencroaching our space.\n\n00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:07.827\nThis is the most important juncture.\n\n00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:09.723\nPast meets present.\n\n00:11:09.747 --> 00:11:12.963\nThis figure, Jonah, who spent\nthree days in the belly of the whale,\n\n00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:15.840\nfor the Christians, is the symbol\nof the renewal of humanity\n\n00:11:15.864 --> 00:11:17.127\nthrough Jesus' sacrifice,\n\n00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:19.899\nbut for the multitudes\nof visitors to that museum\n\n00:11:19.923 --> 00:11:22.693\nfrom all faiths who visit there every day,\n\n00:11:22.717 --> 00:11:29.303\nhe is the moment the distant past\nencounters and meets immediate reality.\n\n00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:34.642\nAll of this brings us to the yawning\narchway of the altar wall,\n\n00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:37.429\nwhere we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,\n\n00:11:37.453 --> 00:11:41.319\npainted in 1534 after the world\nhad changed again.\n\n00:11:41.343 --> 00:11:43.367\nThe Reformation had splintered the Church,\n\n00:11:43.391 --> 00:11:46.259\nthe Ottoman Empire had made\nIslam a household word\n\n00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:49.777\nand Magellan had found a route\ninto the Pacific Ocean.\n\n00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:54.463\nHow is a 59-year-old artist who has never\nbeen any further than Venice\n\n00:11:54.487 --> 00:11:56.681\ngoing to speak to this new world?\n\n00:11:56.705 --> 00:11:59.748\nMichelangelo chose to paint destiny,\n\n00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:01.592\nthat universal desire,\n\n00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:03.236\ncommon to all of us,\n\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.429\nto leave a legacy of excellence.\n\n00:12:06.453 --> 00:12:09.384\nTold in terms of the Christian vision\nof the Last Judgment,\n\n00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:10.720\nthe end of the world,\n\n00:12:10.744 --> 00:12:13.882\nMichelangelo gave you a series of figures\n\n00:12:13.906 --> 00:12:17.061\nwho are wearing these\nstrikingly beautiful bodies.\n\n00:12:17.085 --> 00:12:19.807\nThey have no more covers,\nno more portraits\n\n00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:21.068\nexcept for a couple.\n\n00:12:21.092 --> 00:12:23.810\nIt's a composition only out of bodies,\n\n00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:27.220\n391, no two alike,\n\n00:12:27.244 --> 00:12:29.698\nunique like each and every one of us.\n\n00:12:29.722 --> 00:12:33.464\nThey start in the lower corner,\nbreaking away from the ground,\n\n00:12:33.488 --> 00:12:36.210\nstruggling and trying to rise.\n\n00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:38.690\nThose who have risen\nreach back to help others,\n\n00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.551\nand in one amazing vignette,\n\n00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:43.667\nyou have a black man and a white man\npulled up together\n\n00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:46.413\nin an incredible vision of human unity\n\n00:12:46.437 --> 00:12:47.879\nin this new world.\n\n00:12:47.903 --> 00:12:51.410\nThe lion's share of the space\ngoes to the winner's circle.\n\n00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:56.270\nThere you find men and women\ncompletely nude like athletes.\n\n00:12:56.294 --> 00:12:58.606\nThey are the ones\nwho have overcome adversity,\n\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.344\nand Michelangelo's vision\nof people who combat adversity,\n\n00:13:02.368 --> 00:13:03.642\novercome obstacles --\n\n00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:05.560\nthey're just like athletes.\n\n00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:09.013\nSo you have men and women\nflexing and posing\n\n00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:11.121\nin this extraordinary spotlight.\n\n00:13:11.513 --> 00:13:14.058\nPresiding over this assembly is Jesus,\n\n00:13:14.082 --> 00:13:16.100\nfirst a suffering man on the cross,\n\n00:13:16.124 --> 00:13:18.528\nnow a glorious ruler in Heaven.\n\n00:13:18.552 --> 00:13:21.570\nAnd as Michelangelo\nproved in his painting,\n\n00:13:21.594 --> 00:13:24.172\nhardship, setbacks and obstacles,\n\n00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:27.430\nthey don't limit excellence,\nthey forge it.\n\n00:13:28.234 --> 00:13:30.822\nNow, this does lead us to one odd thing.\n\n00:13:30.846 --> 00:13:32.663\nThis is the Pope's private chapel,\n\n00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:35.844\nand the best way you can describe that\nis indeed a stew of nudes.\n\n00:13:35.868 --> 00:13:39.631\nBut Michelangelo was trying to use\nonly the best artistic language,\n\n00:13:39.655 --> 00:13:42.243\nthe most universal artistic language\nhe could think of:\n\n00:13:42.267 --> 00:13:44.027\nthat of the human body.\n\n00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:49.857\nAnd so instead of the way of showing\nvirtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,\n\n00:13:49.881 --> 00:13:54.146\nhe borrowed from Julius II's\nwonderful collection of sculptures\n\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.421\nin order to show inner strength\nas external power.\n\n00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:02.691\nNow, one contemporary did write\n\n00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:06.573\nthat the chapel was too beautiful\nto not cause controversy.\n\n00:14:06.597 --> 00:14:07.946\nAnd so it did.\n\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.508\nMichelangelo soon found\nthat thanks to the printing press,\n\n00:14:11.532 --> 00:14:14.654\ncomplaints about the nudity\nspread all over the place,\n\n00:14:14.678 --> 00:14:18.974\nand soon his masterpiece of human drama\nwas labeled pornography,\n\n00:14:18.998 --> 00:14:21.173\nat which point he added\ntwo more portraits,\n\n00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:23.681\none of the man who criticized him,\na papal courtier,\n\n00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:27.837\nand the other one of himself\nas a dried up husk, no athlete,\n\n00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:30.282\nin the hands of a long-suffering martyr.\n\n00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:33.974\nThe year he died he saw\nseveral of these figures covered over,\n\n00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:39.617\na triumph for trivial distractions\nover his great exhortation to glory.\n\n00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:41.889\nAnd so

In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted. We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture. We tend to think of it as an intransigent given. We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't.Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remains democracy-free. Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe.Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece \u2014 the newly elected Greek government \u2014 in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process \u2014 our elections \u2014 could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy. I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy \u2014 that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy. And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted.Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak you understand \u2014 you know it, you recognize it \u2014 is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. We all recognize the mountain of debts. But few people discern its twin. A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy.Now let me give you two numbers. Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods \u2014 things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth. $3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks,  failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets.The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe out of work. And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing \u2014 exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him, unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.This is my quarrel with capitalism. Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer? I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy? Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government.Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many. Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded.What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state. Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long. Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly. And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens. They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution. Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters. And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere \u2014 the corporate world, if you want \u2014 as a democracy-free zone.Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power.Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated.(Laughter)It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate.Indeed, I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism. If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve.Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, causing economic crisis. Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth.Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants.Now, this is not an original idea. The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it?The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor. Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots. The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including \u2014 soon, I believe \u2014 in places like China.So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.(Laughter)So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning. The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.I think we can afford to be optimistic. But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples.At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company \u2014 whichever one you happen to work at at that time \u2014 is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment. Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete. No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks.At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, on behalf of all humanity. And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency \u2014 let's call it \"the cosmos,\" in units of cosmos \u2014 with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus. And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.This is not a new idea. It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference. The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it. Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian. But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.Will such a world dawn? Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia? The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively. It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Yanis ... It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist. What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant. Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is \u2014 if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand,what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation. With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy. So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant. But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused.(Laughter)BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.(Laughter)(Applause)YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say \u2014YV: That was Einstein, actually \u2014BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China. Would you like to share that?YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy. In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy. It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is \u2014 the economic sphere \u2014 a completely democracy-free zone.In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century. Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy \u2014 that's a mistake, historically. Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process. So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second. And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy.BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.YV: I knew this was coming.BG: Yes.BG: Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year?YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone. Not just Greece, the Eurozone. To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive \u2014 and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program \u2014 which by the way, was the first program to manifest that denial \u2014 to put it right. And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial.But you know what happens. This is the experience of the Soviet Union. When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically.BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?YV: Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future.BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?YV: Every day.BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back \u2014(Applause)No, but seriously. If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people. Of course I made mistakes.The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February. I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground. And there wasn't. They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone. And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece. We lost one-third of our nominal GDP. This is worse than the Great Depression. And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, \"This was a colossal mistake.\"BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European.YV: Absolutely. Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe. My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive. Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union. And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy.We are probably the largest economy in the world. And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.

doubt\n\n00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:52.494\nthat it is perfectly possible\nto have a flourishing capitalism,\n\n00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:54.118\nspectacular growth,\n\n00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:57.974\nwhile politics remains democracy-free.\n\n00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:02.414\nIndeed, democracy is receding\nin our neck of the woods,\n\n00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:04.014\nhere in Europe.\n\n00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:07.414\nEarlier this year,\nwhile I was representing Greece --\n\n00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:10.174\nthe newly elected Greek government --\n\n00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:12.894\nin the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,\n\n00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:17.854\nI was told in no uncertain terms\nthat our nation's democratic process --\n\n00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.294\nour elections --\n\n00:01:19.318 --> 00:01:21.094\ncould not be allowed to interfere\n\n00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:24.358\nwith economic policies\nthat were being implemented in Greece.\n\n00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:26.294\nAt that moment,\n\n00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:30.614\nI felt that there could be no greater\nvindication of Lee Kuan Yew,\n\n00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:32.174\nor the Chinese Communist Party,\n\n00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:35.934\nindeed of some recalcitrant\nfriends of mine who kept telling me\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.278\nthat democracy would be banned\nif it ever threatened to change anything.\n\n00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:44.854\nTonight, here, I want to present to you\n\n00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:48.038\nan economic case\nfor an authentic democracy.\n\n00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:53.414\nI want to ask you\nto join me in believing again\n\n00:01:53.438 --> 00:01:55.438\nthat Lee Kuan Yew,\n\n00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:57.814\nthe Chinese Communist Party\n\n00:01:57.838 --> 00:01:59.214\nand indeed the Eurogroup\n\n00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:02.878\nare wrong in believing\nthat we can dispense with democracy --\n\n00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:07.294\nthat we need an authentic,\nboisterous democracy.\n\n00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:10.294\nAnd without democracy,\n\n00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:13.174\nour societies will be nastier,\n\n00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:15.334\nour future bleak\n\n00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:18.174\nand our great, new technologies wasted.\n\n00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:19.454\nSpeaking of waste,\n\n00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:22.253\nallow me to point out\nan interesting paradox\n\n00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:25.054\nthat is threatening\nour economies as we speak.\n\n00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.374\nI call it the twin peaks paradox.\n\n00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:28.694\nOne peak you understand --\n\n00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:30.334\nyou know it, you recognize it --\n\n00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:35.414\nis the mountain of debts\nthat has been casting a long shadow\n\n00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:38.254\nover the United States,\nEurope, the whole world.\n\n00:02:38.278 --> 00:02:40.158\nWe all recognize the mountain of debts.\n\n00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:44.958\nBut few people discern its twin.\n\n00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.798\nA mountain of idle cash\n\n00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:52.158\nbelonging to rich savers\nand to corporations,\n\n00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:55.654\ntoo terrified to invest it\n\n00:02:55.678 --> 00:02:58.974\ninto the productive activities\nthat can generate the incomes\n\n00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:02.054\nfrom which you can extinguish\nthe mountain of debts\n\n00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:06.054\nand which can produce all those things\nthat humanity desperately needs,\n\n00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:07.734\nlike green energy.\n\n00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.094\nNow let me give you two numbers.\n\n00:03:10.118 --> 00:03:11.454\nOver the last three months,\n\n00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:14.254\nin the United States,\nin Britain and in the Eurozone,\n\n00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:18.694\nwe have invested, collectively,\n3.4 trillion dollars\n\n00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:21.374\non all the wealth-producing goods --\n\n00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:24.414\nthings like industrial plants, machinery,\n\n00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.654\noffice blocks, schools,\n\n00:03:26.678 --> 00:03:29.814\nroads, railways, machinery,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n00:03:29.838 --> 00:03:32.574\n$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money\n\n00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:36.454\nuntil you compare it to the $5.1 trillion\n\n00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:39.174\nthat has been slushing around\nin the same countries,\n\n00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.014\nin our financial institutions,\n\n00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:44.238\ndoing absolutely nothing\nduring the same period\n\n00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:50.254\nexcept inflating stock exchanges\nand bidding up house prices.\n\n00:03:50.278 --> 00:03:55.534\nSo a mountain of debt\nand a mountain of idle cash\n\n00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:59.254\nform twin peaks, \nfailing to cancel each other out\n\n00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:02.094\nthrough the normal\noperation of the markets.\n\n00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:04.438\nThe result is stagnant wages,\n\n00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:10.974\nmore than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds\nin America, in Japan and in Europe\n\n00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:12.494\nout of work.\n\n00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.854\nAnd consequently, low aggregate demand,\n\n00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:17.094\nwhich in a never-ending cycle,\n\n00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:19.838\nreinforces the pessimism of the investors,\n\n00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:24.654\nwho, fearing low demand,\nreproduce it by not investing --\n\n00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:27.374\nexactly like Oedipus' father,\n\n00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:29.893\nwho, terrified\nby the prophecy of the oracle\n\n00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:32.654\nthat his son would grow up to kill him,\n\n00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:34.614\nunwittingly engineered the conditions\n\n00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:37.638\nthat ensured that Oedipus,\nhis son, would kill him.\n\n00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:40.518\nThis is my quarrel with capitalism.\n\n00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:43.174\nIts gross wastefulness,\n\n00:04:43.198 --> 00:04:44.814\nall this idle cash,\n\n00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:48.934\nshould be energized to improve lives,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.294\nto develop human talents,\n\n00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:53.174\nand indeed to finance\nall these technologies,\n\n00:04:53.198 --> 00:04:54.454\ngreen technologies,\n\n00:04:54.478 --> 00:04:57.238\nwhich are absolutely essential\nfor saving planet Earth.\n\n00:04:58.238 --> 00:05:01.494\nAm I right in believing\nthat democracy might be the answer?\n\n00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:02.734\nI believe so,\n\n00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:03.974\nbut before we move on,\n\n00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:05.398\nwhat do we mean by democracy?\n\n00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:08.894\nAristotle defined democracy\n\n00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:13.854\nas the constitution\nin which the free and the poor,\n\n00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:16.038\nbeing in the majority, control government.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.254\nNow, of course Athenian democracy\nexcluded too many.\n\n00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.318\nWomen, migrants and,\nof course, the slaves.\n\n00:05:23.998 --> 00:05:25.254\nBut it would be a mistake\n\n00:05:25.278 --> 00:05:28.854\nto dismiss the significance\nof ancient Athenian democracy\n\n00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:30.878\non the basis of whom it excluded.\n\n00:05:31.638 --> 00:05:32.894\nWhat was more pertinent,\n\n00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:36.774\nand continues to be so\nabout ancient Athenian democracy,\n\n00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:40.294\nwas the inclusion of the working poor,\n\n00:05:40.318 --> 00:05:45.014\nwho not only acquired\nthe right to free speech,\n\n00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:47.294\nbut more importantly, crucially,\n\n00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:49.934\nthey acquired the rights\nto political judgments\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.334\nthat were afforded equal weight\n\n00:05:52.358 --> 00:05:56.014\nin the decision-making\nconcerning matters of state.\n\n00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:59.094\nNow, of course, Athenian\ndemocracy didn't last long.\n\n00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:03.534\nLike a candle that burns brightly,\nit burned out quickly.\n\n00:06:03.558 --> 00:06:04.774\nAnd indeed,\n\n00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:09.054\nour liberal democracies today\ndo not have their roots in ancient Athens.\n\n00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:11.414\nThey have their roots in the Magna Carta,\n\n00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.694\nin the 1688 Glorious Revolution,\n\n00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:16.934\nindeed in the American constitution.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.974\nWhereas Athenian democracy\nwas focusing on the masterless citizen\n\n00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:24.278\nand empowering the working poor,\n\n00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:29.374\nour liberal democracies are founded\non the Magna Carta tradition,\n\n00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:32.494\nwhich was, after all,\na charter for masters.\n\n00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:36.814\nAnd indeed, liberal democracy\nonly surfaced when it was possible\n\n00:06:36.838 --> 00:06:40.694\nto separate fully the political sphere\nfrom the economic sphere,\n\n00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:45.774\nso as to confine the democratic process\nfully in the political sphere,\n\n00:06:45.798 --> 00:06:47.654\nleaving the economic sphere --\n\n00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:49.614\nthe corporate world, if you want --\n\n00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:52.318\nas a democracy-free zone.\n\n00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:56.654\nNow, in our democracies today,\n\n00:06:56.678 --> 00:07:00.174\nthis separation of the economic\nfrom the political sphere,\n\n00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:02.454\nthe moment it started happening,\n\n00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:06.774\nit gave rise to an inexorable,\nepic struggle between the two,\n\n00:07:06.798 --> 00:07:10.014\nwith the economic sphere\ncolonizing the political sphere,\n\n00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:11.558\neating into its power.\n\n00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:15.838\nHave you wondered why politicians\nare not what they used to be?\n\n00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:18.934\nIt's not because their DNA\nhas degenerated.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:25.214\nIt is rather because one can be\nin government today and not in power,\n\n00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:28.534\nbecause power has migrated\nfrom the political to the economic sphere,\n\n00:07:28.558 --> 00:07:29.798\nwhich is separate.\n\n00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:32.694\nIndeed,\n\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.014\nI spoke about my quarrel\nwith capitalism.\n\n00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.774\nIf you think about it,\n\n00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:40.118\nit is a little bit like\na population of predators,\n\n00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:45.758\nthat are so successful in decimating\nthe prey that they must feed on,\n\n00:07:46.518 --> 00:07:48.654\nthat in the end they starve.\n\n00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:49.894\nSimilarly,\n\n00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:53.614\nthe economic sphere has been colonizing\nand cannibalizing the political sphere\n\n00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:57.014\nto such an extent\nthat it is undermining itself,\n\n00:07:57.038 --> 00:07:58.774\ncausing economic crisis.\n\n00:07:58.798 --> 00:08:00.894\nCorporate power is increasing,\n\n00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:03.134\npolitical goods are devaluing,\n\n00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:04.974\ninequality is rising,\n\n00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:06.574\naggregate demand is falling\n\n00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:12.718\nand CEOs of corporations are too scared\nto invest the cash of their corporations.\n\n00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:20.134\nSo the more capitalism succeeds\nin taking the demos out of democracy,\n\n00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:21.494\nthe taller the twin peaks\n\n00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:25.054\nand the greater the waste\nof human resources\n\n00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:26.518\nand humanity's wealth.\n\n00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:30.454\nClearly, if this is right,\n\n00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:33.534\nwe must reunite the political\nand economic spheres\n\n00:08:33.558 --> 00:08:37.054\nand better do it\nwith a demos being in control,\n\n00:08:37.078 --> 00:08:40.014\nlike in ancient Athens\nexcept without the slaves\n\n00:08:40.038 --> 00:08:42.998\nor the exclusion of women and migrants.\n\n00:08:44.078 --> 00:08:45.814\nNow, this is not an original idea.\n\n00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:48.613\nThe Marxist left\nhad that idea 100 years ago\n\n00:08:48.637 --> 00:08:50.318\nand it didn't go very well, did it?\n\n00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:54.214\nThe lesson that we learned\nfrom the Soviet debacle\n\n00:08:54.238 --> 00:09:00.574\nis that only by a miracle\nwill the working poor be reempowered,\n\n00:09:00.598 --> 00:09:02.574\nas they were in ancient Athens,\n\n00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:06.358\nwithout creating new forms\nof brutality and waste.\n\n00:09:06.918 --> 00:09:08.158\nBut there is a solution:\n\n00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:10.678\neliminate the working poor.\n\n00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:12.574\nCapitalism's doing it\n\n00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:17.478\nby replacing low-wage workers\nwith automata, androids, robots.\n\n00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:20.254\nThe problem is\n\n00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:23.494\nthat as long as the economic\nand the political spheres are separate,\n\n00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:27.838\nautomation makes the twin peaks taller,\n\n00:09:28.598 --> 00:09:30.334\nthe waste loftier\n\n00:09:30.358 --> 00:09:32.414\nand the social conflicts deeper,\n\n00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:33.638\nincluding --\n\n00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:35.814\nsoon, I believe --\n\n00:09:35.838 --> 00:09:37.438\nin places like China.\n\n00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.094\nSo we need to reconfigure,\n\n00:09:41.118 --> 00:09:44.774\nwe need to reunite the economic\nand the political spheres,\n\n00:09:44.798 --> 00:09:50.174\nbut we'd better do it\nby democratizing the reunified sphere,\n\n00:09:50.198 --> 00:09:55.894\nlest we end up with\na surveillance-mad hyperautocracy\n\n00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:59.934\nthat makes The Matrix, the movie,\nlook like a documentary.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:01.558 --> 00:10:04.974\nSo the question is not\nwhether capitalism will survive\n\n00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:07.318\nthe technological innovations\nit is spawning.\n\n00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:09.534\nThe more interesting question\n\n00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:15.294\nis whether capitalism will be succeeded\nby something resembling a Matrix dystopia\n\n00:10:15.318 --> 00:10:19.734\nor something much closer\nto a Star Trek-like society,\n\n00:10:19.758 --> 00:10:22.134\nwhere machines serve the humans\n\n00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:26.574\nand the humans expend their energies\nexploring the universe\n\n00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:30.894\nand indulging in long debates\nabout the meaning of life\n\n00:10:30.918 --> 00:10:34.918\nin some ancient, Athenian-like,\nhigh tech agora.\n\n00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:39.758\nI think we can afford to be optimistic.\n\n00:10:41.358 --> 00:10:42.654\nBut what would it take,\n\n00:10:42.678 --> 00:10:44.654\nwhat would it look like\n\n00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:49.558\nto have this Star Trek-like utopia,\ninstead of the Matrix-like dystopia?\n\n00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:51.454\nIn practical terms,\n\n00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:53.214\nallow me to share just briefly,\n\n00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:54.438\na couple of examples.\n\n00:10:55.038 --> 00:10:56.814\nAt the level of the enterprise,\n\n00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:59.174\nimagine a capital market,\n\n00:10:59.198 --> 00:11:01.878\nwhere you earn capital as you work,\n\n00:11:02.838 --> 00:11:08.174\nand where your capital follows you\nfrom one job to another,\n\n00:11:08.198 --> 00:11:09.694\nfrom one company to another,\n\n00:11:09.718 --> 00:11:10.974\nand the company --\n\n00:11:10.998 --> 00:11:14.454\nwhichever one you happen\nto work at at that time --\n\n00:11:14.478 --> 00:11:18.798\nis solely owned by those who happen\nto work in it at that moment.\n\n00:11:19.358 --> 00:11:24.054\nThen all income stems\nfrom capital, from profits,\n\n00:11:24.078 --> 00:11:28.454\nand the very concept\nof wage labor becomes obsolete.\n\n00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:35.094\nNo more separation between those\nwho own but do not work in the company\n\n00:11:35.118 --> 00:11:38.374\nand those who work\nbut do not own the company;\n\n00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.598\nno more tug-of-war\nbetween capital and labor;\n\n00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:46.534\nno great gap between\ninvestment and saving;\n\n00:11:46.558 --> 00:11:49.798\nindeed, no towering twin peaks.\n\n00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:52.934\nAt the level of the global\npolitical economy,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.894\nimagine for a moment\n\n00:11:54.918 --> 00:11:59.894\nthat our national currencies\nhave a free-floating exchange rate,\n\n00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:03.694\nwith a universal,\nglobal, digital currency,\n\n00:12:03.718 --> 00:12:07.734\none that is issued\nby the International Monetary Fund,\n\n00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:08.974\nthe G-20,\n\n00:12:08.998 --> 00:12:11.534\non behalf of all humanity.\n\n00:12:11.558 --> 00:12:12.774\nAnd imagine further\n\n00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:17.134\nthat all international trade\nis denominated in this currency --\n\n00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:18.974\nlet's call it \"the cosmos,\"\n\n00:12:18.998 --> 00:12:20.398\nin units of cosmos --\n\n00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:26.054\nwith every government agreeing\nto be paying into a common fund\n\n00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:31.614\na sum of cosmos units proportional\nto the country's trade deficit,\n\n00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:35.038\nor indeed to a country's trade surplus.\n\n00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:40.894\nAnd imagine that that fund is utilized\nto invest in green technologies,\n\n00:12:40.918 --> 00:12:46.238\nespecially in parts of the world\nwhere investment funding is scarce.\n\n00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:48.374\nThis is not a new idea.\n\n00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:51.734\nIt's what, effectively,\nJohn Maynard Keynes proposed\n\n00:12:51.758 --> 00:12:55.078\nin 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.\n\n00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:57.254\nThe problem is\n\n00:12:57.278 --> 00:13:00.574\nthat back then, they didn't have\nthe technology to implement it.\n\n00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:01.814\nNow we do,\n\n00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:07.758\nespecially in the context\nof a reunified political-economic sphere.\n\n00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:11.014\nThe world that I am describing to you\n\n00:13:11.038 --> 00:13:13.494\nis simultaneously libertarian,\n\n00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:18.094\nin that it prioritizes\nempowered individuals,\n\n00:13:18.118 --> 00:13:19.334\nMarxist,\n\n00:13:19.358 --> 00:13:22.574\nsince it will have confined\nto the dustbin of history\n\n00:13:22.598 --> 00:13:25.054\nthe division between capital and labor,\n\n00:13:25.078 --> 00:13:26.638\nand Keynesian,\n\n00:13:27.278 --> 00:13:28.758\nglobal Keynesian.\n\n00:13:30.278 --> 00:13:31.854\nBut above all else,\n\n00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:36.798\nit is a world in which we will be able\nto imagine an authentic democracy.\n\n00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:39.478\nWill such a world dawn?\n\n00:13:40.358 --> 00:13:44.854\nOr shall we descend\ninto a Matrix-like dystopia?\n\n00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:48.998\nThe answer lies in the political choice\nthat we shall be making collectively.\n\n00:13:49.678 --> 00:13:51.294\nIt is our choice,\n\n00:13:51.318 --> 00:13:53.638\nand we'd better make it democratically.\n\n00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:55.494\nThank you.\n\n00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:58.878\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:02.638\nBruno Giussani: Yanis ...\n\n00:14:03.838 --> 00:14:08.278\nIt was you who described yourself\nin your bios as a libertarian Marxist.\n\n00:14:10.358 --> 00:14:12.878\nWhat is the relevance\nof Marx's analysis today?\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.294\nYanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was\nany relevance in what I just said,\n\n00:14:17.318 --> 00:14:18.534\nthen Marx is relevant.\n\n00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:22.054\nBecause the whole point of reunifying\nthe political and economic is --\n\n00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:23.294\nif we don't do it,\n\n00:14:23.318 --> 00:14:25.574\nthen technological innovation\nis going to create\n\n00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.894\nsuch a massive fall in aggregate demand,\n\n00:14:27.918 --> 00:14:32.694\nwhat Larry Summers\nrefers to as secular stagnation.\n\n00:14:32.718 --> 00:14:35.574\nWith this crisis migrating\nfrom one part of the world,\n\n00:14:35.598 --> 00:14:37.134\nas it is now,\n\n00:14:37.158 --> 00:14:39.854\nit will destabilize\nnot only our democracies,\n\n00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:44.094\nbut even the emerging world that is not\nthat keen on liberal democracy.\n\n00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:47.934\nSo if this analysis holds water,\nthen Marx is absolutely relevant.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.694\nBut so is Hayek,\n\n00:14:49.718 --> 00:14:51.534\nthat's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,\n\n00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:52.774\nand so is Keynes,\n\n00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:54.694\nso that's why I'm totally confused.\n\n00:14:54.718 --> 00:14:55.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.014\nBG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.\n\n00:14:58.038 --> 00:14:59.334\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:01.334\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:04.134\nYV: If you are not confused,\nyou are not thinking, OK?\n\n00:15:04.158 --> 00:15:07.254\nBG: That's a very, very Greek\nphilosopher kind of thing to say --\n\n00:15:07.278 --> 00:15:08.934\nYV: That was Einstein, actually --\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.574\nBG: During your talk\nyou mentioned Singapore and China,\n\n00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:13.654\nand last night at the speaker dinner,\n\n00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:18.854\nyou expressed a pretty strong opinion\nabout how the West looks at China.\n\n00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:20.454\nWould you like to share that?\n\n00:15:20.478 --> 00:15:22.638\nYV: Well, there's a great\ndegree of hypocrisy.\n\n00:15:23.358 --> 00:15:27.654\nIn our liberal democracies,\nwe have a semblance of democracy.\n\n00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:30.414\nIt's because we have confined,\nas I was saying in my talk,\n\n00:15:30.438 --> 00:15:32.094\ndemocracy to the political sphere,\n\n00:15:32.118 --> 00:15:35.574\nwhile leaving the one sphere\nwhere all the action is --\n\n00:15:35.598 --> 00:15:36.814\nthe economic sphere --\n\n00:15:36.838 --> 00:15:38.678\na completely democracy-free zone.\n\n00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:40.494\nIn a sense,\n\n00:15:40.518 --> 00:15:42.718\nif I am allowed to be provocative,\n\n00:15:43.838 --> 00:15:48.254\nChina today is closer to Britain\nin the 19th century.\n\n00:15:48.278 --> 00:15:49.534\nBecause remember,\n\n00:15:49.558 --> 00:15:51.894\nwe tend to associate\nliberalism with democracy --\n\n00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:53.414\nthat's a mistake, historically.\n\n00:15:53.438 --> 00:15:55.974\nLiberalism, liberal,\nit's like John Stuart Mill.\n\n00:15:55.998 --> 00:16:00.694\nJohn Stuart Mill was particularly\nskeptical about the democratic process.\n\n00:16:00.718 --> 00:16:06.094\nSo what you are seeing now in China\nis a very similar process\n\n00:16:06.118 --> 00:16:09.294\nto the one that we had in Britain\nduring the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:16:09.318 --> 00:16:12.294\nespecially the transition\nfrom the first to the second.\n\n00:16:12.318 --> 00:16:15.614\nAnd to be castigating China\n\n00:16:15.638 --> 00:16:18.774\nfor doing that which the West did\nin the 19th century,\n\n00:16:18.798 --> 00:16:20.118\nsmacks of hypocrisy.\n\n00:16:21.478 --> 00:16:25.134\nBG: I am sure that many people here\nare wondering about your experience\n\n00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:27.894\nas the Finance Minister

--> 00:16:39.774\nand very disappointing,\n\n00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:43.694\nbecause we had an opportunity\nto reboot the Eurozone.\n\n00:16:43.718 --> 00:16:45.814\nNot just Greece, the Eurozone.\n\n00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.774\nTo move away from the complacency\n\n00:16:48.798 --> 00:16:51.254\nand the constant denial\nthat there was a massive --\n\n00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:54.134\nand there is a massive\narchitectural fault line\n\n00:16:54.158 --> 00:16:56.334\ngoing through the Eurozone,\n\n00:16:56.358 --> 00:17:00.774\nwhich is threatening, massively,\nthe whole of the European Union process.\n\n00:17:00.798 --> 00:17:03.974\nWe had an opportunity\non the basis of the Greek program --\n\n00:17:03.998 --> 00:17:05.334\nwhich by the way,\n\n00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:09.734\nwas the first program\nto manifest that denial --\n\n00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:10.974\nto put it right.\n\n00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:12.214\nAnd, unfortunately,\n\n00:17:12.238 --> 00:17:14.054\nthe powers in the Eurozone,\n\n00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:15.278\nin the Eurogroup,\n\n00:17:16.037 --> 00:17:18.014\nchose to maintain denial.\n\n00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.294\nBut you know what happens.\n\n00:17:19.317 --> 00:17:21.373\nThis is the experience\nof the Soviet Union.\n\n00:17:21.398 --> 00:17:23.893\nWhen you try to keep alive\n\n00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:27.797\nan economic

mistakes.\n\n00:18:11.078 --> 00:18:13.894\nThe greatest mistake\nwas to sign the application\n\n00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:16.014\nfor the extension of a loan agreement\n\n00:18:16.038 --> 00:18:17.654\nin the end of February.\n\n00:18:17.678 --> 00:18:18.894\nI was imagining\n\n00:18:18.918 --> 00:18:21.894\nthat there was a genuine interest\non the side of the

00:18:33.734\nthat were running through the Eurozone.\n\n00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:35.574\nAnd because they didn't want to admit\n\n00:18:35.598 --> 00:18:39.214\nthat for five years they were implementing\na catastrophic program in Greece.\n\n00:18:39.238 --> 00:18:42.134\nWe lost one-third of our nominal GDP.\n\n00:18:42.158 --> 00:18:44.094\nThis is worse than the Great Depression.\n\n00:18:44.118 --> 00:18:45.374\nAnd no one has come clean\n\n00:18:45.398 --> 00:18:48.334\nfrom the troika of lenders\nthat have been imposing this policy\n\n00:18:48.358 -->

not survive.\n\n00:19:11.238 --> 00:19:12.694\nBecause if it doesn't,\n\n00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:15.574\nthe centrifugal forces\nthat will be unleashed\n\n00:19:15.598 --> 00:19:17.294\nwill be

"I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer with National Geographic, but I want to share a secret. This image is totally incorrect, totally incorrect. I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids. All right, the mermaid is indeed real, but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this. It's because the ocean is this massive filter, and as soon as you start going underwater, you're going to lose your colors, and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.But we're humans \u2014 we're terrestrial mammals. And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts. We love eye-popping color, and we try to bring this eye-popping color underwater with us.So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater, and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin, who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph. And they're in there with old-school scuba suits, where you're pumping air down to them, and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder, and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus, and \u2014 boom! \u2014 a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish. I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real. They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color.And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us, that we've been looking at the blue ocean, and it's a crucible of blue, and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors. And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like. It's like an underwater light show.(Music)Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image. These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light.So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters. As we go down underwater, after about 10 meters, all the red is gone. So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red, it's an animal transforming and creating its own red. This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals. And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are. One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules. And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass \u2014 could be this fluorescent protein. So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role. And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me, because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science, and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.So, how do I study this? In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night. And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals. We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this. In the middle of our corals, is this green fluorescent fish. It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter. And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters, thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera, but the eel was real.It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely. So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist, John Sparks, and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is. And fish are much more interesting than corals, because they have really advanced vision, and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it, they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence. So I wanted to seek this out further.So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world, looking for fluorescent life. And it's a bit like \"E.T. phone home.\" We're out there swimming with this blue light, and we're looking for a response, for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us. And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel. It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about. They're only about the size of my finger, and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock. But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights, and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue. Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time. But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life, like this green fluorescent bream, with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape, and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there.After this fish, we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock. The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral.Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish. These lizardfish come in many varieties, and they look almost exactly alike under white light. But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them. And in total \u2014 we just reported this last year \u2014 we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlev\u00e9. He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology. He would design his own gear, make his own cameras, and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth. So this is the male seahorse. They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head. The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures. So he stayed awake for days. He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him, so he could capture this moment. Now, I wish I could have shown Painlev\u00e9 the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying. And here's our footage.(Music)They're the most cryptic fish. You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse. They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect.But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray, because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, which includes ... sharks. So I'm, like, a coral biologist. Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent. And there I am.(Laughter)And I was like, \"Maybe I should go back to corals.\"(Laughter)It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent. And then we found it. In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers. Here it is. They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator. And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks. Just magnificent \u2014 I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark.But this is all beautiful to see. I was like, this is gorgeous. But what does it mean to the shark? Can they see this? And we looked in the literature, and nothing was known about this shark's vision. So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue-green interface, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark, but they only see blue-green. So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue, creating green. It's creating contrast that they can indeed see. So we have a model, showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns. And males and females also have, we're finding, distinct patterns among them.But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now, in the Solomon Islands. Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle. So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles, which, again, this is only one month old, but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision. And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn. And here in the Solomon Islands, there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, and this is one of the hotspots for them. So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here, and understand them.In thinking about biofluorescence, I wanted to know, how deep does it go? Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean? So we started using submarines, and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here. And we dropped down, and we noticed one important thing \u2014 that as we get down to 1,000 meters, it drops off. There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters \u2014 almost nothing, it's just darkness. So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon. And below 1,000 meters, we encountered the bioluminescent zone, where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking.As I try to get deeper, this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit \u2014 some people call this my \"Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen\" moment.(Laughter)But as we explore down here, I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately? Because we're entering a new age of exploration, where we have to take great care, and we have to set examples how we explore. So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers, so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there. The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle. Some corals could be 1,000 years old. You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. So my dream is something like this. At night, I'm in a submarine, I have force-feedback gloves, and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine, where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars, and we can conduct our research.Back to the powerful applied applications. Here, you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures, this one from jellyfish and corals, to illuminate the living brain and see its connections. It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better. And even more mind-blowing, is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage. So he could see when a single neuron fires. You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures.So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship. From deep space, our universe looks like a human brain cell, and then here we are in the deep ocean, and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind. And it's my hope that with illuminated minds, we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life, and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2414, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:15.856\nI'm a marine biologist\nand an

hidden under a rock.\n\n00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.970\nBut these eels do come out to mate\nunder full-moon nights,\n\n00:05:41.994 --> 00:05:45.487\nand that full-moon night\ntranslates underwater to blue.\n\n00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.041\nPerhaps they're using this\nas a way to see each other,\n\n00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:49.526\nquickly find each other, mate,\n\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.264\ngo back into their hole\nfor the next long stint of time.\n\n00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:56.168\nBut then we started to find\nother fluorescent marine life,\n\n00:05:56.192 --> 00:05:58.989\nlike this green fluorescent bream,\n\n00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:02.998\nwith its, like, racing stripes\nalong its head and its nape,\n\n00:06:03.022 --> 00:06:07.323\nand it's almost camouflaged\nand fluorescing at the same intensity\n\n00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:09.133\nas the fluorescent coral there.\n\n00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:12.235\nAfter this fish,\n\n00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.560\nwe were introduced to this red\nfluorescent scorpionfish\n\n00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.727\ncloaked and hidden on this rock.\n\n00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:22.552\nThe only time we've ever seen this,\nit's either on red fluorescent algae\n\n00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:24.251\nor red fluorescent coral.\n\n00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:29.925\nLater, we found this stealthy\ngreen fluorescent lizardfish.\n\n00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.037\nThese lizardfish come in many varieties,\n\n00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:35.330\nand they look almost exactly alike\nunder white light.\n\n00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.728\nBut if you look at them\nunder fluorescent light,\n\n00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:39.153\nyou see lots of patterns,\n\n00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:41.863\nyou can really see\nthe differences among them.\n\n00:06:41.887 --> 00:06:44.824\nAnd in total -- we just reported\nthis last year --\n\n00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:49.196\nwe found over 200 species\nof biofluorescent fish.\n\n00:06:50.093 --> 00:06:56.019\nOne of my inspirations is French artist\nand biologist Jean Painlev\u00e9.\n\n00:06:56.043 --> 00:07:00.092\nHe really captures this entrepreneuring,\ncreative spirit in biology.\n\n00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:03.919\nHe would design his own gear,\nmake his own cameras,\n\n00:07:03.943 --> 00:07:07.937\nand he was fascinated with the seahorse,\nHippocampus erectus,\n\n00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:11.188\nand he filmed for the first time\nthe seahorse giving birth.\n\n00:07:12.044 --> 00:07:13.596\nSo this is the male seahorse.\n\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.334\nThey were one of the first fish\nto start swimming upright\n\n00:07:18.358 --> 00:07:19.986\nwith their brain above their head.\n\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.161\nThe males give birth,\n\n00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:22.605\njust phenomenal creatures.\n\n00:07:24.913 --> 00:07:26.255\nSo he stayed awake for days.\n\n00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.454\nHe even put this electrical visor\non his head that would shock him,\n\n00:07:29.478 --> 00:07:31.070\nso he could capture this moment.\n\n00:07:32.754 --> 00:07:34.874\nNow, I wish I could have shown Painlev\u00e9\n\n00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:37.995\nthe moment where we found\nbiofluorescent seahorses\n\n00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:40.718\nin the exact same species\nthat he was studying.\n\n00:07:40.742 --> 00:07:41.956\nAnd here's our footage.\n\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.807\n(Music)\n\n00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:47.901\nThey're the most cryptic fish.\n\n00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:51.305\nYou could be swimming right on top of them\nand not see the seahorse.\n\n00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:56.694\nThey would blend right into the algae,\nwhich would also fluoresce red,\n\n00:07:56.718 --> 00:07:58.179\nbut they've got great vision,\n\n00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:00.377\nand they go through\nthis long mating ritual,\n\n00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:02.503\nand perhaps they're using it\nin that effect.\n\n00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:06.524\nBut things got pretty edgy\n\n00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.413\nwhen we found green\nfluorescence in the stingray,\n\n00:08:12.437 --> 00:08:15.201\nbecause stingrays are\nin the Elasmobranch class,\n\n00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:16.464\nwhich includes ...\n\n00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:18.492\nsharks.\n\n00:08:18.516 --> 00:08:21.714\nSo I'm, like, a coral biologist.\n\n00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:25.564\nSomebody's got to go down and check\nto see if the sharks are fluorescent.\n\n00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.850\nAnd there I am.\n\n00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:28.272\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:30.835\nAnd I was like, \"Maybe I should\ngo back to corals.\"\n\n00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:31.891\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:34.311\nIt turns out that these sharks\nare not fluorescent.\n\n00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.847\nAnd then we found it.\n\n00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:41.709\nIn a deep, dark canyon\noff the coast of California,\n\n00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:46.170\nwe found the first\nbiofluorescent swellshark,\n\n00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:47.969\nright underneath all the surfers.\n\n00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:49.178\nHere it is.\n\n00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:51.926\nThey're just about a meter long.\nIt's called a swellshark.\n\n00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.862\nAnd they call them a swellshark\nbecause if they're threatened,\n\n00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:57.632\nthey can gulp down water\nand blow up like an inner tube,\n\n00:08:57.656 --> 00:08:58.815\nabout twice their size,\n\n00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:03.584\nand wedge themselves under a rock,\nso they don't get eaten by a predator.\n\n00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:08.259\nAnd here is our first footage\nof these biofluorescent swellsharks.\n\n00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:13.908\nJust magnificent -- I mean,\nthey're showing these distinct patterns,\n\n00:09:13.932 --> 00:09:17.505\nand there are areas that are fluorescent\nand areas that are not fluorescent,\n\n00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:20.118\nbut they've also got these\ntwinkling spots on them\n\n00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:22.733\nthat are much brighter\nthan other parts of the shark.\n\n00:09:22.757 --> 00:09:25.284\nBut this is all beautiful to see.\n\n00:09:25.308 --> 00:09:26.938\nI was like, this is gorgeous.\n\n00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:29.793\nBut what does it mean to the shark?\n\n00:09:29.817 --> 00:09:31.164\nCan they see this?\n\n00:09:31.188 --> 00:09:32.720\nAnd we looked in the literature,\n\n00:09:32.744 --> 00:09:35.902\nand nothing was known\nabout this shark's vision.\n\n00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:40.108\nSo I took this shark to eye specialist\nEllis Loew at Cornell University,\n\n00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:43.655\nand we found out that this shark\nsees discretely and acutely\n\n00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.773\nin the blue-green interface,\n\n00:09:45.797 --> 00:09:48.627\nprobably about 100 times better\nthan we can see in the dark,\n\n00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:50.377\nbut they only see blue-green.\n\n00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:53.520\nSo what it's doing\nis taking this blue world\n\n00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:56.297\nand it's absorbing the blue,\ncreating green.\n\n00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:59.139\nIt's creating contrast\nthat they can indeed see.\n\n00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:00.314\nSo we have a model,\n\n00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:03.710\nshowing that it creates an ability\nfor them to see all these patterns.\n\n00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:06.615\nAnd males and females\nalso have, we're finding,\n\n00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.575\ndistinct patterns among them.\n\n00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:14.667\nBut our last find came really just\na few miles from where we are now,\n\n00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:16.142\nin the Solomon Islands.\n\n00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:20.626\nSwimming at night, I encountered\nthe first biofluorescent sea turtle.\n\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.062\nSo now it's going from fish\nand sharks into reptiles,\n\n00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:27.370\nwhich, again, this is only one month old,\n\n00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:29.772\nbut it shows us\nthat we know almost nothing\n\n00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.070\nabout this hawksbill turtle's vision.\n\n00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:34.950\nAnd it makes me think about\nhow much more there is to learn.\n\n00:10:34.974 --> 00:10:36.506\nAnd here in the Solomon Islands,\n\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.101\nthere's only a few thousand\nbreeding females of this species left,\n\n00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:42.169\nand this is one of the hotspots for them.\n\n00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:45.260\nSo it shows us how much we need\nto really protect these animals\n\n00:10:45.284 --> 00:10:47.640\nwhile they're still here,\nand understand them.\n\n00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:49.808\nIn thinking about biofluorescence,\n\n00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:51.777\nI wanted to know, how deep does it go?\n\n00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:54.245\nDoes this go all the way\nto the bottom of the ocean?\n\n00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.816\nSo we started using submarines,\nand we equipped them\n\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.014\nwith special blue lights\non the front here.\n\n00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:01.998\nAnd we dropped down,\n\n00:11:02.022 --> 00:11:04.739\nand we noticed one important thing --\n\n00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:08.061\nthat as we get down to 1,000 meters,\n\n00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.401\nit drops off.\n\n00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:13.329\nThere's no biofluorescent marine life\ndown there, below 1,000 meters --\n\n00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:15.358\nalmost nothing, it's just darkness.\n\n00:11:15.382 --> 00:11:17.812\nSo it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.\n\n00:11:17.836 --> 00:11:19.289\nAnd below 1,000 meters,\n\n00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:21.974\nwe encountered the bioluminescent zone,\n\n00:11:21.998 --> 00:11:25.335\nwhere nine out of 10 animals\nare actually making their own lights\n\n00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:27.113\nand flashing and blinking.\n\n00:11:27.137 --> 00:11:28.510\nAs I try to get deeper,\n\n00:11:28.534 --> 00:11:31.509\nthis is slapping on a one-person\nsubmarine suit --\n\n00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:35.296\nsome people call this my \"Jacques Cousteau\nmeets Woody Allen\" moment.\n\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.471\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:38.546\nBut as we explore down here,\n\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.289\nI was thinking about: How do we\ninteract with life delicately?\n\n00:11:42.313 --> 00:11:45.010\nBecause we're entering\na new age of exploration,\n\n00:11:45.034 --> 00:11:46.837\nwhere we have to take great care,\n\n00:11:46.861 --> 00:11:49.556\nand we have to set examples\nhow we explore.\n\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.244\nSo I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood\nat Harvard University,\n\n00:11:53.268 --> 00:11:57.407\nand we've been designing\nsquishy underwater robot fingers,\n\n00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:01.420\nso we can delicately interact\nwith the marine life down there.\n\n00:12:01.444 --> 00:12:06.159\nThe idea is that most of our technologies\nto explore the deep ocean\n\n00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:08.963\ncome from oil and gas and military,\n\n00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:11.828\nwho, you know, they're not really\ncaring to be gentle.\n\n00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:14.535\nSome corals could be 1,000 years old.\n\n00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:17.668\nYou don't want to just go\nand crush them with a big claw.\n\n00:12:17.692 --> 00:12:19.690\nSo my dream is something like this.\n\n00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:22.010\nAt night, I'm in a submarine,\n\n00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:24.144\nI have force-feedback gloves,\n\n00:12:24.168 --> 00:12:27.486\nand I could delicately set up\na lab in the front of my submarine,\n\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.049\nwhere the squishy robot fingers\n\n00:12:30.073 --> 00:12:32.558\nare delicately collecting\nand putting things in jars,\n\n00:12:32.582 --> 00:12:34.167\nand we can conduct our research.\n\n00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:37.415\nBack to the powerful applied applications.\n\n00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:40.279\nHere, you're looking at a living brain\n\n00:12:40.303 --> 00:12:43.670\nthat's using the DNA\nof fluorescent marine creatures,\n\n00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:45.700\nthis one from jellyfish and corals,\n\n00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:49.193\nto illuminate the living brain\nand see its connections.\n\n00:12:49.217 --> 00:12:50.733\nIt's funny that we're using RGB\n\n00:12:50.757 --> 00:12:53.305\njust to kind of satisfy\nour own human intuition,\n\n00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:55.663\nso we can see our brains better.\n\n00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:57.735\nAnd even more mind-blowing,\n\n00:12:57.759 --> 00:13:00.869\nis my close colleague\nVincent Pieribone at Yale,\n\n00:13:00.893 --> 00:13:04.270\nwho has actually designed and engineered\na fluorescent protein\n\n00:13:04.294 --> 00:13:06.389\nthat responds to voltage.\n\n00:13:06.413 --> 00:13:09.515\nSo he could see\nwhen a single neuron fires.\n\n00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:14.078\nYou're essentially looking at\na portal into consciousness\n\n00:13:14.102 --> 00:13:17.016\nthat was designed by marine creatures.\n\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.746\nSo this brings me all back\nto perspective and relationship.\n\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.009\nFrom deep space,\n\n00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:28.185\nour universe looks\nlike a human brain cell,\n\n00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:30.691\nand then here we are in the deep ocean,\n\n00:13:30.715 --> 00:13:33.586\nand we're finding\nmarine creatures and cells\n\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.889\nthat can illuminate the human mind.\n\n00:13:35.913 --> 00:13:39.031\nAnd it's my hope\nthat with illuminated minds,\n\n00:13:39.055 --> 00:13:42.840\nwe could ponder the overarching\ninterconnectedness of all life,\n\n00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.222\nand fathom how much more lies in store\n\n00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:46.961\nif we keep our oceans healthy.\n\n00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:48.143\nThank you.\n\n00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:53.283\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Should you be able to patent a human gene?", "duration": "1085", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tania_simoncelli_should_you_be_able_to_patent_a_human_gene", "transcript": "It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005. I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor. I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office. Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years, so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck. I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties \u2014 super interesting. But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way, in a way that could really make a difference.So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says, \"Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?\"\"Well, there's genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and ... oh, there's this really cool issue, functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ... oh, and of course, there's gene patents.\"\"Gene patents?\"\"Yes, you know, patents on human genes.\"\"No! You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body? That can't be right.\"I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles. And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office. \"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?\"(Laughter)Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics. I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer, let alone a patent lawyer. So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene. Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial of these are to so-called \"isolated DNA\" \u2014 namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.Gene patent proponents say, \"See? We didn't patent the gene in your body, we patented an isolated gene.\" And that's true, but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated. And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene.So what does that mean?That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder. It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing. Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.Consider Abigail, a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome, a serious heart condition that, if left untreated, can result in sudden death. The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome. But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it. So another lab tried to offer the test, but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement. So as a result, for 2 years, no test was available. During that time, Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients. But was there a way we could challenge them?Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible. You can't patent products of nature \u2014 the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table. And you can't patent laws of nature \u2014 the law of gravity, E = mc2. These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none.It seemed to us that DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, that codes for the production of all of our proteins, is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.As we delved into this issue, we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts \u2014 scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers. Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy, and, at least in theory, as a matter of law. All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero.Why is that? Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years. There were literally thousands of patents on human genes. The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo, the biotech industry had grown up around this practice, and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress, and had gone absolutely nowhere. So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge, and hearing, \"Being right just isn't enough,\" seemed all the more reason to take on this fight. So we set out to build our case.Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B over some really narrow, obscure technical issue. We weren't really interested in that kind of case, and we thought this case was much bigger than that. This was about scientific freedom, medical progress, the rights of patients. So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case \u2014 more like a civil rights case.We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics, a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Myriad held patents on two genes, the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes. Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States. It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop. It charged a lot of money for its test \u2014 over 3,000 dollars. It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community. And perhaps worst of all, for a period of several years, Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer \u2014 a negative test result that should have been positive.This is Kathleen Maxian. Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad. The test was negative. The family was relieved. That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family, and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested. But two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result. Had Eileen received the proper result, Kathleen would have then been tested, and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.Once we settled on Myriad, we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems. We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs: genetic counselors, geneticists who had received cease and desist letters, advocacy organizations, four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals, and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test, or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not, as a result of the patents.One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science. So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention, and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature, we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like: What's a gene? What's DNA? How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts, trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately. And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors, like gold.So isolating DNA \u2014 it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed. You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold, but you can't patent the gold itself. It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain; you still can't patent it, it's still gold. And the gold, once it's extracted, can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain; you can make jewelry out of it for example \u2014 still can't patent the gold, it's still gold.So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case. We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet. In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion \u2014 152 pages \u2014 and a complete victory for our side.In reading the opinion, we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case. I mean, our brief \u2014 it was pretty good, but not this good. How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time? We just could not comprehend how this had happened. So it turned out, Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time, was not just a lawyer \u2014 he was a scientist. He was not just a scientist \u2014 he had a PhD in molecular biology.(Laughter)What an incredible stroke of luck!Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And here things got really interesting.First, in a pivotal moment of this case, the US government switched sides.So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side. But now in direct opposition to its own patent office, the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion, and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible. This was a really big deal, totally unexpected.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases, and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent. So even with this remarkable development, we expected to lose. And we did. Sort of. Ends up split decision, 2 to 1. But the two judges who ruled against us, did so for completely different reasons. The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory \u2014 totally wrong.(Laughter)He decided Myriad had created a new chemical \u2014 made absolutely no sense. Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue. The other, Judge Moore, said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature. But she's like, \"I don't want to shake up the biotech industry.\" The third, Judge Bryson, agreed with us.So now we sought review by the Supreme Court. And when you petition the Supreme Court, you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer. Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph, like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses, \"wherein this\" and \"therefore that.\" We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever. Four words: Are human genes patentable?Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words, I said, \"Well, I don't know. I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'\"\"Nope. I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago.\"Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that.The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives, and it agreed to hear ours. The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting \u2014 long line of people outside, people had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse. Two breast cancer organizations, Breast Cancer Action and FORCE, had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway, moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career. I was clearly more nervous than he was. But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories, the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical, patient advocacy, environmental and religious organizations, who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project, including the co-discoverer of DNA himself, James Watson, who had submitted a brief to the court, where he referred to gene patenting as \"lunacy.\"(Laughter)The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake.The argument itself was riveting. Chris argued brilliantly. But for me, the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA, through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges, very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years. Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon. Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree. And in one of my absolutely favorite moments, Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be \"just nature sitting there.\"(Laughter)We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day, but I could never have anticipated the outcome: nine to zero.\"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature, and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated. And furthermore, Myriad did not create anything.\"Within 24 hours of the decision, five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes. Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's. Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering.But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad. It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States. It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation. And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need.A few weeks after the court issued its decision, I received a small package in the mail. It was from Bob Cook-Deegan, a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case. I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.(Laughter)We took a big risk in taking this case. Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing. The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish, with many twists and turns along the way. A little luck certainly helped, but it was the communities that we bridged, the alliances that we created, that made pigs fly.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2416, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:16.540\nIt was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.\n\n00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.882\nI was working at the ACLU\nas the organization's science advisor.\n\n00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:23.953\nI really, really loved my job,\n\n00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:25.613\nbut I was having one of those days\n\n00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:28.206\nwhere I was feeling\njust a little bit discouraged.\n\n00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:33.327\nSo I wandered down the hallway\nto my colleague Chris Hansen's office.\n\n00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.979\nChris had been at the ACLU\nfor more than 30 years,\n\n00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.078\nso he had deep institutional\nknowledge and insights.\n\n00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:44.571\nI explained to Chris\nthat I was feeling a little bit stuck.\n\n00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.652\nI had been investigating\na number of issues\n\n00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:52.977\nat the intersection of science\nand civil liberties -- super interesting.\n\n00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.911\nBut I wanted the ACLU to engage\nthese issues in a much bigger way,\n\n00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:59.180\nin a way that could really\nmake a difference.\n\n00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.661\nSo Chris cut right\nto the chase, and he says,\n\n00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:07.145\n\"Well, of all the issues you've been\nlooking at, what are the top five?\"\n\n00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:10.138\n\"Well, there's genetic discrimination,\n\n00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:12.587\nand reproductive technologies,\n\n00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.752\nand biobanking, and ...\n\n00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:16.618\noh, there's this really cool issue,\n\n00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.291\nfunctional MRI and using it\nfor lie detection, and ...\n\n00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:21.436\noh, and of course, there's gene patents.\"\n\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.089\n\"Gene patents?\"\n\n00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:26.007\n\"Yes, you know, patents on human genes.\"\n\n00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:27.537\n\"No!\n\n00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:30.022\nYou're telling me that the US government\n\n00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.970\nhas been issuing patents\non part of the human body?\n\n00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.184\nThat can't be right.\"\n\n00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.278\nI went back to my office\nand sent Chris three articles.\n\n00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:43.239\nAnd 20 minutes later,\nhe came bursting in my office.\n\n00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:46.879\n\"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?\"\n\n00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:48.797\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:52.045\nNow Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,\n\n00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.978\nbut he knew almost nothing\nabout patent law\n\n00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.438\nand certainly nothing about genetics.\n\n00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:00.340\nI knew something about genetics,\nbut I wasn't even a lawyer,\n\n00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.025\nlet alone a patent lawyer.\n\n00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.515\nSo clearly we had a lot to learn\nbefore we could file a lawsuit.\n\n00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:08.852\nFirst, we needed to understand\nexactly what was patented\n\n00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:10.557\nwhen someone patented a gene.\n\n00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:15.459\nGene patents typically contain\ndozens of claims,\n\n00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:20.260\nbut the most controversial of these\nare to so-called \"isolated DNA\" --\n\n00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:25.098\nnamely, a piece of DNA\nthat has been removed from a cell.\n\n00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:27.330\nGene patent proponents say,\n\n00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:30.528\n\"See? We didn't patent\nthe gene in your body,\n\n00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:32.487\nwe patented an isolated gene.\"\n\n00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:34.307\nAnd that's true,\n\n00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:41.064\nbut the problem is that any use\nof the gene requires that it be isolated.\n\n00:02:42.468 --> 00:02:46.873\nAnd the patents weren't just\nto a particular gene that they isolated,\n\n00:02:46.897 --> 00:02:49.784\nbut on every possible\nversion of that gene.\n\n00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.478\nSo what does that mean?\n\n00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.001\nThat means that you can't give\nyour gene to your doctor\n\n00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:57.321\nand ask him or her to look at it,\n\n00:02:57.345 --> 00:02:59.445\nsay, to see if it has any mutations,\n\n00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.545\nwithout permission of the patent holder.\n\n00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.514\nIt also means that the patent holder\nhas the right to stop anyone\n\n00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:10.020\nfrom using that gene\nin research or clinical testing.\n\n00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.527\nAllowing patent holders,\n\n00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.835\noften private companies,\n\n00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.345\nto lock up stretches of the human genome\nwas harming patients.\n\n00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.068\nConsider Abigail,\n\n00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:22.485\na 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,\n\n00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.933\na serious heart condition that,\nif left untreated,\n\n00:03:25.957 --> 00:03:27.735\ncan result in sudden death.\n\n00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.791\nThe company that obtained a patent on two\ngenes associated with this condition\n\n00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:35.297\ndeveloped a test to diagnose the syndrome.\n\n00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.145\nBut then they went bankrupt\nand they never offered it.\n\n00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.946\nSo another lab tried to offer the test,\n\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.958\nbut the company that held the patents\nthreatened to sue the lab\n\n00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:45.164\nfor patent infringement.\n\n00:03:45.188 --> 00:03:46.347\nSo as a result,\n\n00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:49.233\nfor 2 years, no test was available.\n\n00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:51.399\nDuring that time,\n\n00:03:51.423 --> 00:03:54.673\nAbigail died of undiagnosed long QT.\n\n00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:58.971\nGene patents clearly were a problem\nand were harming patients.\n\n00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:01.831\nBut was there a way\nwe could challenge them?\n\n00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:03.956\nTurns out that the Supreme Court\n\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.094\nhas made clear\nthrough a long line of cases,\n\n00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:09.904\nthat certain things\nare not patent eligible.\n\n00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.257\nYou can't patent products of nature --\n\n00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:18.315\nthe air, the water, minerals,\nelements of the periodic table.\n\n00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:21.240\nAnd you can't patent laws of nature --\n\n00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.430\nthe law of gravity, E = mc2.\n\n00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:29.673\nThese things are just too fundamental\nand must remain free to all\n\n00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:31.520\nand reserved exclusively to none.\n\n00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.453\nIt seemed to us that DNA,\n\n00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:36.993\nthe most fundamental structure of life,\n\n00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:39.673\nthat codes for the production\nof all of our proteins,\n\n00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:42.923\nis both a product of nature\nand a law of nature,\n\n00:04:42.947 --> 00:04:45.649\nregardless of whether it's in our bodies\n\n00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:47.711\nor sitting in the bottom of a test tube.\n\n00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:49.936\nAs we delved into this issue,\n\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.868\nwe traveled all over the country\nto speak with many different experts --\n\n00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:58.259\nscientists, medical professionals,\nlawyers, patent lawyers.\n\n00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:02.621\nMost of them agreed that we were right\nas a matter of policy,\n\n00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:05.430\nand, at least in theory,\nas a matter of law.\n\n00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:07.426\nAll of them thought\n\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.020\nour chances of winning\na gene-patent challenge\n\n00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:11.911\nwere about zero.\n\n00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:14.949\nWhy is that?\n\n00:05:14.973 --> 00:05:18.060\nWell, the patent office\nhad been issuing these patents\n\n00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.785\nfor more than 20 years.\n\n00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:23.524\nThere were literally thousands\nof patents on human genes.\n\n00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:27.742\nThe patent bar was deeply\nentrenched in the status quo,\n\n00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.162\nthe biotech industry had grown up\naround this practice,\n\n00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:35.305\nand legislation to ban gene patents\nhad been introduced\n\n00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:36.727\nyear after year in Congress,\n\n00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:38.542\nand had gone absolutely nowhere.\n\n00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:40.573\nSo the bottom line:\n\n00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:44.160\ncourts just weren't going to be willing\nto overturn these patents.\n\n00:05:44.874 --> 00:05:49.469\nNow, neither Chris nor I were the type\nto shy away from a challenge,\n\n00:05:49.493 --> 00:05:52.637\nand hearing, \"Being right\njust isn't enough,\"\n\n00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:55.191\nseemed all the more reason\nto take on this fight.\n\n00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:58.204\nSo we set out to build our case.\n\n00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:02.942\nNow, patent cases tend to be:\nCompany A sues Company B\n\n00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:06.149\nover some really narrow,\nobscure technical issue.\n\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.145\nWe weren't really interested\nin that kind of case,\n\n00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.558\nand we thought this case\nwas much bigger than that.\n\n00:06:11.582 --> 00:06:14.070\nThis was about scientific freedom,\nmedical progress,\n\n00:06:14.094 --> 00:06:15.553\nthe rights of patients.\n\n00:06:15.577 --> 00:06:18.680\nSo we decided we were going\nto develop a case\n\n00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:21.222\nthat was not like\nyour typical patent case --\n\n00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:23.485\nmore like a civil rights case.\n\n00:06:24.714 --> 00:06:27.556\nWe set out to identify\na gene-patent holder\n\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.365\nthat was vigorously enforcing its patents\n\n00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.683\nand then to organize a broad coalition\nof plaintiffs and experts\n\n00:06:33.707 --> 00:06:35.597\nthat could tell the court\n\n00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:40.010\nabout all the ways that these patents\nwere harming patients and innovation.\n\n00:06:41.362 --> 00:06:44.484\nWe found the prime candidate\nto sue in Myriad Genetics,\n\n00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:47.363\na company that's based\nin Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:50.926\nMyriad held patents on two genes,\n\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.271\nthe BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.\n\n00:06:55.108 --> 00:06:57.842\nWomen with certain mutations\nalong these genes\n\n00:06:57.866 --> 00:07:00.492\nare considered to be\nat a significantly increased risk\n\n00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:02.461\nof developing breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:05.672\nMyriad had used its patents to maintain\n\n00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:09.905\na complete monopoly on BRCA testing\nin the United States.\n\n00:07:10.502 --> 00:07:14.690\nIt had forced multiple labs\nthat were offering BRCA testing to stop.\n\n00:07:14.714 --> 00:07:16.873\nIt charged a lot of money for its test --\n\n00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:18.580\nover 3,000 dollars.\n\n00:07:19.047 --> 00:07:21.382\nIt had stopped sharing its clinical data\n\n00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.693\nwith the international\nscientific community.\n\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.383\nAnd perhaps worst of all,\n\n00:07:26.407 --> 00:07:28.843\nfor a period of several years,\n\n00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:32.580\nMyriad refused to update its test\nto include additional mutations\n\n00:07:32.604 --> 00:07:36.225\nthat had been identified\nby a team of researchers in France.\n\n00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:39.440\nIt has been estimated\nthat during that period,\n\n00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:40.837\nfor several years,\n\n00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:44.613\nas many as 12 percent of women\nundergoing testing\n\n00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:47.039\nreceived the wrong answer --\n\n00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:52.104\na negative test result\nthat should have been positive.\n\n00:07:53.443 --> 00:07:55.184\nThis is Kathleen Maxian.\n\n00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.387\nKathleen's sister Eileen\ndeveloped breast cancer at age 40\n\n00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:01.251\nand she was tested by Myriad.\n\n00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.716\nThe test was negative.\n\n00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.266\nThe family was relieved.\n\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:09.078\nThat meant that Eileen's cancer\nmost likely didn't run in the family,\n\n00:08:09.102 --> 00:08:12.117\nand that other members of her family\ndidn't need to be tested.\n\n00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:14.031\nBut two years later,\n\n00:08:14.055 --> 00:08:18.115\nKathleen was diagnosed\nwith advanced-stage ovarian cancer.\n\n00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:22.757\nIt turned out that Kathleen's sister\nwas among the 12 percent\n\n00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:25.650\nwho received a false-negative test result.\n\n00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:29.394\nHad Eileen received the proper result,\n\n00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.791\nKathleen would have then been tested,\n\n00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.728\nand her ovarian cancer\ncould have been prevented.\n\n00:08:36.776 --> 00:08:38.040\nOnce we settled on Myriad,\n\n00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:41.949\nwe then had to form a coalition\nof plaintiffs and experts\n\n00:08:41.973 --> 00:08:44.061\nthat could illuminate these problems.\n\n00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:46.657\nWe ended up with 20\nhighly committed plaintiffs:\n\n00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:48.821\ngenetic counselors,\n\n00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:52.204\ngeneticists who had received\ncease and desist letters,\n\n00:08:52.863 --> 00:08:54.712\nadvocacy organizations,\n\n00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.555\nfour major scientific organizations\nthat collectively represented\n\n00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:02.109\nmore than 150,000 scientists\nand medical professionals,\n\n00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:06.010\nand individual women who either\ncouldn't afford Myriad's test,\n\n00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:09.038\nor who wanted to obtain\na second opinion but could not,\n\n00:09:09.062 --> 00:09:10.806\nas a result of the patents.\n\n00:09:12.273 --> 00:09:15.713\nOne of the major challenges\nwe had in preparing the case\n\n00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:18.603\nwas figuring out how best\nto communicate the science.\n\n00:09:19.037 --> 00:09:22.868\nSo in order to argue that what Myriad did\nwas not an invention,\n\n00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:26.169\nand that isolated BRCA genes\nwere products of nature,\n\n00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:29.795\nwe had to explain a couple\nof basic concepts, like:\n\n00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.963\nWhat's a gene? What's DNA?\n\n00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:35.703\nHow is DNA isolated,\nand why isn't that an invention?\n\n00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:40.988\nWe spent hours and hours\nwith our plaintiffs and experts,\n\n00:09:41.012 --> 00:09:43.948\ntrying to come up with ways\nof explaining these concepts\n\n00:09:43.972 --> 00:09:45.515\nsimply yet accurately.\n\n00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:49.596\nAnd we ended up relying heavily\non the use of metaphors,\n\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.776\nlike gold.\n\n00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:54.031\nSo isolating DNA --\n\n00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:56.555\nit's like extracting gold from a mountain\n\n00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:59.079\nor taking it out of a stream bed.\n\n00:09:59.103 --> 00:10:02.777\nYou might be able to patent\nthe process for mining the gold,\n\n00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.882\nbut you can't patent the gold itself.\n\n00:10:05.887 --> 00:10:08.630\nIt might've taken a lot\nof hard work and effort\n\n00:10:08.654 --> 00:10:10.514\nto dig the gold out of the mountain;\n\n00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:13.366\nyou still can't patent it,\nit's still gold.\n\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.146\nAnd the gold, once it's extracted,\n\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.258\ncan clearly be used\nfor all sorts of things\n\n00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:20.018\nthat it couldn't be used\nfor when it was in the mountain;\n\n00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:22.224\nyou can make jewelry\nout of it for example --\n\n00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:24.413\nstill can't patent the gold,\nit's still gold.\n\n00:10:25.322 --> 00:10:29.176\nSo now it's 2009,\nand we're ready to file our case.\n\n00:10:30.244 --> 00:10:33.739\nWe filed in federal court\nin the Southern District of New York,\n\n00:10:34.313 --> 00:10:37.679\nand the case was randomly assigned\nto Judge Robert Sweet.\n\n00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:41.757\nIn March 2010, Judge Sweet\nissued his opinion --\n\n00:10:42.527 --> 00:10:44.385\n152 pages --\n\n00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:47.044\nand a complete victory for our side.\n\n00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:49.353\nIn reading the opinion,\n\n00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:54.092\nwe could not get over how eloquently\nhe described the science in the case.\n\n00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:57.233\nI mean, our brief --\nit was pretty good,\n\n00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.824\nbut not this good.\n\n00:10:59.736 --> 00:11:03.113\nHow did he develop such a deep\nunderstanding of this issue\n\n00:11:03.137 --> 00:11:04.297\nin such a short time?\n\n00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:07.929\nWe just could not comprehend\nhow this had happened.\n\n00:11:07.953 --> 00:11:09.217\nSo it turned out,\n\n00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:12.551\nJudge Sweet's clerk\nworking for him at the time,\n\n00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:14.055\nwas not just a lawyer --\n\n00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.793\nhe was a scientist.\n\n00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:17.415\nHe was not just a scientist --\n\n00:11:17.439 --> 00:11:20.585\nhe had a PhD in molecular biology.\n\n00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:22.360\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:24.959\nWhat an incredible stroke of luck!\n\n00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:27.316\nMyriad then appealed\n\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.835\nto the US Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit.\n\n00:11:30.454 --> 00:11:32.470\nAnd here things got really interesting.\n\n00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:36.483\nFirst, in a pivotal moment of this case,\n\n00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:39.776\nthe US government switched sides.\n\n00:11:40.697 --> 00:11:44.446\nSo in the district court the government\nsubmitted a brief on Myriad's side.\n\n00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.598\nBut now in direct opposition\nto its own patent office,\n\n00:11:49.622 --> 00:11:52.330\nthe US government files a brief\nthat states that is has\n\n00:11:52.354 --> 00:11:56.042\nreconsidered this issue\nin light of the district court's opinion,\n\n00:11:56.066 --> 00:11:59.252\nand has concluded that isolated DNA\nis not patent eligible.\n\n00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:01.587\nThis was a really big deal,\n\n00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:03.173\ntotally unexpected.\n\n00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:06.811\nThe Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit\n\n00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:08.518\nhears all patent cases,\n\n00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:11.700\nand it has a reputation for being\nvery, very pro-patent.\n\n00:12:12.263 --> 00:12:14.689\nSo even with this remarkable development,\n\n00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:16.392\nwe expected to lose.\n\n00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:17.763\nAnd we did.\n\n00:12:18.347 --> 00:12:19.499\nSort of.\n\n00:12:20.315 --> 00:12:22.902\nEnds up split decision, 2 to 1.\n\n00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.197\nBut the two judges who ruled against us,\n\n00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:28.462\ndid so for completely different reasons.\n\n00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:31.059\nThe first one, Judge Lourie,\n\n00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:34.098\nmade up his own novel,\nbiological theory --\n\n00:12:34.122 --> 00:12:35.290\ntotally wrong.\n\n00:12:35.314 --> 00:12:36.325\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.349 --> 00:12:38.567\nHe decided Myriad had created\na new chemical --\n\n00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.456\nmade absolutely no sense.\n\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.266\nMyriad didn't even argue this,\nso it came out of the blue.\n\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.567\nThe other, Judge Moore,\n\n00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:49.469\nsaid she basically agreed with us\nthat isolated DNA is a product of nature.\n\n00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:53.278\nBut she's like, \"I don't want\nto shake up the biotech industry.\"\n\n00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:56.778\nThe third, Judge Bryson,\n\n00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:58.407\nagreed with us.\n\n00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:02.239\nSo now we sought review\nby the Supreme Court.\n\n00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:04.966\nAnd when you petition the Supreme Court,\n\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.112\nyou have to present a question\nthat you want the Court to answer.\n\n00:13:08.492 --> 00:13:12.219\nUsually these questions take the form\nof a super-long paragraph,\n\n00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:15.266\nlike a whole page long\nwith lots and lots of clauses,\n\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.747\n\"wherein this\" and \"therefore that.\"\n\n00:13:18.252 --> 00:13:22.159\nWe submitted perhaps\nthe shortest question presented ever.\n\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.483\nFour words:\n\n00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:28.229\nAre human genes patentable?\n\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.704\nNow when Chris first asked me\nwhat I thought of these words,\n\n00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.102\nI said, \"Well, I don't know.\n\n00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:36.293\nI think you have to say,\n'Is isolated DNA patentable?'\"\n\n00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:38.095\n\"Nope.\n\n00:13:38.445 --> 00:13:43.066\nI want the justices to have\nthe very same reaction that I had\n\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.177\nwhen you brought this issue\nto me seven years ago.\"\n\n00:13:46.854 --> 00:13:49.011\nWell, I certainly couldn't\nargue with that.\n\n00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:52.822\nThe Supreme Court only hears\nabout one percent\n\n00:13:52.846 --> 00:13:54.512\nof the cases that it receives,\n\n00:13:54.536 --> 00:13:56.127\nand it agreed to hear ours.\n\n00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.857\nThe day of the oral argument arrives,\nand it was really, really exciting --\n\n00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:03.316\nlong line of people outside,\n\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.104\npeople had been standing in line\nsince 2:30 in the morning\n\n00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:07.862\nto try to get into the courthouse.\n\n00:14:07.886 --> 00:14:09.857\nTwo breast cancer organizations,\n\n00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:11.549\nBreast Cancer Action and FORCE,\n\n00:14:11.573 --> 00:14:14.274\nhad organized a demonstration\non the courthouse steps.\n\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.060\nChris and I sat quietly in the hallway,\n\n00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:21.748\nmoments before he was to walk in and argue\n\n00:14:21.772 --> 00:14:24.088\nthe most important case of his career.\n\n00:14:24.723 --> 00:14:27.102\nI was clearly more nervous than he was.\n\n00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:32.814\nBut any remaining panic subsided\nas I walked into the courtroom\n\n00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:35.651\nand looked around\nat a sea of friendly faces:\n\n00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:37.782\nour individual women clients\n\n00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:40.247\nwho had shared their\ndeeply personal stories,\n\n00:14:41.168 --> 00:14:44.794\nthe geneticists who had taken huge chunks\nof time out of their busy careers\n\n00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:46.643\nto dedicate themselves to this fight\n\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.659\nand representatives from a diverse array\n\n00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:51.570\nof medical, patient advocacy,\n\n00:14:51.594 --> 00:14:53.670\nenvironmental and religious organizations,\n\n00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:57.226\nwho had submitted friend of the court\nbriefs in the case.\n\n00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:01.592\nAlso in the room were three leaders\nof the Human Genome Project,\n\n00:15:01.616 --> 00:15:04.288\nincluding the co-discoverer\nof DNA himself,\n\n00:15:04.312 --> 00:15:05.602\nJames Watson,\n\n00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:07.772\nwho had submitted a brief to the court,\n\n00:15:07.796 --> 00:15:11.307\nwhere he referred\nto gene patenting as \"lunacy.\"\n\n00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:13.179\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:16.840\nThe diversity of the communities\nrepresented in this room\n\n00:15:16.864 --> 00:15:20.305\nand the contributions each had made\nto make this day a reality\n\n00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:22.626\nspoke volumes to what

me,\n\n00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:32.883\nthe most thrilling aspect was watching\nthe Supreme Court justices grapple\n\n00:15:32.907 --> 00:15:34.476\nwith isolated DNA,\n\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.726\nthrough a series of colorful analogies\nand feisty exchanges,\n\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.090\nvery much the same way\nas our legal team had done\n\n00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:42.804\nfor the past seven years.\n\n00:15:43.624 --> 00:15:46.280\nJustice Kagan likened isolating DNA\n\n00:15:46.304 --> 00:15:49.080\nto extracting a medicinal plant\nfrom the Amazon.\n\n00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:54.484\nJustice Roberts distinguished it\nfrom carving a baseball bat from a tree.\n\n00:15:55.953 --> 00:15:58.435\nAnd in one of my absolutely\nfavorite moments,\n\n00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:03.728\nJustice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA\nto be \"just nature sitting there.\"\n\n00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:04.852\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:08.151\nWe felt pretty confident\nleaving the courtroom that day,\n\n00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:11.181\nbut I could never have\nanticipated the outcome:\n\n00:16:12.532 --> 00:16:14.039\nnine to zero.\n\n00:16:14.983 -->

00:16:31.530\nfive labs had announced\n\n00:16:31.554 --> 00:16:34.568\nthat they would begin to offer testing\nfor the BRCA genes.\n\n00:16:35.107 --> 00:16:38.590\nSome of them promised to offer the

swims like a salamander", "duration": "850", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/auke_ijspeert_a_robot_that_runs_and_swims_like_a_salamander", "transcript": "This is Pleurobot. Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl. Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, and as you'll see later, it can also swim.So you might ask, why did we design this robot? And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience. Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion. But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion. If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things. And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem. It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion. And my goal is to understand how this works.There are four main components behind animal locomotion. The first component is just the body, and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals. Then you have the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity. A third component are central pattern generators. These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate, by themselves, very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals. And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion. But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem. You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion.Now, understanding how this works is very complex, because first of all, recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult. It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae. Especially in humans, very hard to do. A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components. So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time. This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help.So what's biorobotics? Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors, like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots. And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain \u2014 stairs, mountains, forests, places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job. The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well. There are some very nice projects where robots are used, like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics. And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot. So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France, and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots. And here we want to start simple.So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys, which are very primitive fish, and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion, like in salamanders, but also in cats and in humans, in mammals. And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models. And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true. Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD. But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations. Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground, it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer. Why not have a real robot and real physics? So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander. You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian, it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view. It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans. And in fact, the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate, so it's almost a living fossil, which gives us access to our ancestor, the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail. And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait. In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body, and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot. Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body. So if you take a decerebrated salamander \u2014 it's not so nice but you remove the head \u2014 and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord, at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait. If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates. And at some point, there's a threshold, and automatically, the animal switches to swimming. This is amazing. Just changing the global drive, as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord, makes a complete switch between two very different gaits. And in fact, the same has been observed in cats. If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, you can switch between walk, trot and gallop. Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking, at a low level of stimulation, and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation. And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail, and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany. And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail. That's what we did. So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3D. And what we did is collect a whole database of motions, both on ground and in water, to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do. And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot. So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure, where to place the motors, how to connect them together, to be able to replay these motions as well as possible. And this is how Pleurobot came to life.So let's look at how close it is to the real animal. So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot. You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait. If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better. But even better, we can do swimming. So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot \u2014(Laughter)and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits. And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do. The physics of interaction are complex. Our robot is much bigger than a small animal, so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics. But you see at the end, we have a very close match, and we were very, very happy with this. So let's go to the spinal cord. So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits. And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion. And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits. And we tested that on board of a robot.And this is how it looks. So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot. And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain. And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait. For instance, when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait, and at some point, if we stimulate a lot, very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait. And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other. And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle. It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics. So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics, and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion. And we found three important criteria in the properties, basically, of the limbs. The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure. So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel. So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments. A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight. Most of the muscles are in the trunk, which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly. The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces. And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage. So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot. It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat. So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break. It will just jump, in fact. And this very elastic property is also very important. And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop, meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops. And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion. To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion, as you will see in the next video, where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step, and the robot will not fall over, which was a surprise for us. This is a small perturbation. I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over, because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop. But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over. Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything. But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right. And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience, saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.Now, how does this relate to human locomotion? Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion, but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates. And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans. That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects. The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic. This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord. Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion. So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations. And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that, especially at EPFL. My colleagues Gr\u00e9goire Courtine and Silvestro Micera, with whom I collaborate.But to do this properly, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it interacts with the body, and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord. This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim. But for this one, you mentioned in your talk, like a side project, search and rescue, and it does have a camera on its nose.Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot \u2014 We have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection, so this robot is now seeing you. And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded, and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs, why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk, with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor.BG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you. But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust, I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.BG: Thank you very much.

--> 00:02:53.934\nwhere people want to\ntake inspiration from animals\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.414\nto make robots to go outdoors,\n\n00:02:56.438 --> 00:02:59.094\nlike service robots\nor search and rescue robots\n\n00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:00.318\nor field robots.\n\n00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:03.534\nAnd the big goal here\nis to take inspiration from animals\n\n00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.894\nto make robots that can handle\ncomplex terrain --\n\n00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:07.534\nstairs, mountains, forests,\n\n00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:09.574\nplaces where robots\nstill have difficulties\n\n00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:11.654\nand where animals\ncan do a much better job.\n\n00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:14.174\nThe robot can be a wonderful\nscientific tool as well.\n\n00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:16.818\nThere are some very nice projects\nwhere robots are used,\n\n00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:20.814\nlike a scientific tool for neuroscience,\nfor biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.\n\n00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd this is exactly\nthe purpose of Pleurobot.\n\n00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:26.494\nSo what we do in my lab\nis to collaborate with neurobiologists\n\n00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:29.734\nlike Jean-Marie Cabelguen,\na neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,\n\n00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:33.798\nand we want to make spinal cord models\nand validate them on robots.\n\n00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:36.054\nAnd here we want to start simple.\n\n00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:38.054\nSo it's good to start with simple animals\n\n00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:40.334\nlike lampreys, which are\nvery primitive fish,\n\n00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:42.854\nand then gradually\ngo toward more complex locomotion,\n\n00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:44.134\nlike in salamanders,\n\n00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:45.654\nbut also in cats and in humans,\n\n00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:46.878\nin mammals.\n\n00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:50.214\nAnd here, a robot becomes\nan interesting tool\n\n00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:52.174\nto validate our models.\n\n00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:55.214\nAnd in fact, for me, Pleurobot\nis a kind of dream becoming true.\n\n00:03:55.238 --> 00:03:58.494\nLike, more or less 20 years ago\nI was already working on a computer\n\n00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:01.174\nmaking simulations of lamprey\nand salamander locomotion\n\n00:04:01.198 --> 00:04:02.734\nduring my PhD.\n\n00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:06.134\nBut I always knew that my simulations\nwere just approximations.\n\n00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:10.134\nLike, simulating the physics in water\nor with mud or with complex ground,\n\n00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:12.814\nit's very hard to simulate that\nproperly on a computer.\n\n00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:14.878\nWhy not have a real robot\nand real physics?\n\n00:04:15.558 --> 00:04:18.694\nSo among all these animals,\none of my favorites is the salamander.\n\n00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:22.174\nYou might ask why,\nand it's because as an amphibian,\n\n00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:25.054\nit's a really key animal\nfrom an evolutionary point of view.\n\n00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:27.134\nIt makes a wonderful link\nbetween swimming,\n\n00:04:27.158 --> 00:04:29.054\nas you find it in eels or fish,\n\n00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:33.198\nand quadruped locomotion,\nas you see in mammals, in cats and humans.\n\n00:04:34.118 --> 00:04:35.774\nAnd in fact, the modern salamander\n\n00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:38.174\nis very close to the first\nterrestrial vertebrate,\n\n00:04:38.198 --> 00:04:39.734\nso it's almost a living fossil,\n\n00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:41.694\nwhich gives us access to our ancestor,\n\n00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:44.638\nthe ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.\n\n00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:46.574\nSo the salamander swims\n\n00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:49.094\nby doing what's called\nan anguilliform swimming gait,\n\n00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:52.758\nso they propagate a nice traveling wave\nof muscle activity from head to tail.\n\n00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:55.574\nAnd if you place\nthe salamander on the ground,\n\n00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:57.934\nit switches to what's called\na walking trot gait.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.821\nIn this case, you have nice\nperiodic activation of the limbs\n\n00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:02.454\nwhich are very nicely coordinated\n\n00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:05.134\nwith this standing wave\nundulation of the body,\n\n00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:08.814\nand that's exactly the gait\nthat you are seeing here on Pleurobot.\n\n00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:11.814\nNow, one thing which is very surprising\nand fascinating in fact\n\n00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:15.974\nis the fact that all this can be generated\njust by the spinal cord and the body.\n\n00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:17.998\nSo if you take\na decerebrated salamander --\n\n00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:20.038\nit's not so nice\nbut you remove the head --\n\n00:05:20.062 --> 00:05:22.734\nand if you electrically\nstimulate the spinal cord,\n\n00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:26.014\nat low level of stimulation\nthis will induce a walking-like gait.\n\n00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:28.494\nIf you stimulate a bit more,\nthe gait accelerates.\n\n00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:30.414\nAnd at some point, there's a threshold,\n\n00:05:30.438 --> 00:05:32.974\nand automatically,\nthe animal switches to swimming.\n\n00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.374\nThis is amazing.\n\n00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:35.894\nJust changing the global drive,\n\n00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.654\nas if you are pressing the gas pedal\n\n00:05:37.678 --> 00:05:39.814\nof descending modulation\nto your spinal cord,\n\n00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:42.838\nmakes a complete switch\nbetween two very different gaits.\n\n00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.974\nAnd in fact, the same\nhas been observed in cats.\n\n00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:49.014\nIf you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,\n\n00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:51.254\nyou can switch between\nwalk, trot and gallop.\n\n00:05:51.278 --> 00:05:54.014\nOr in birds, you can make a bird\nswitch between walking,\n\n00:05:54.038 --> 00:05:55.494\nat a low level of stimulation,\n\n00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:58.334\nand flapping its wings\nat high-level stimulation.\n\n00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.374\nAnd this really shows that the spinal cord\n\n00:06:00.398 --> 00:06:02.814\nis a very sophisticated\nlocomotion controller.\n\n00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:05.294\nSo we studied salamander locomotion\nin more detail,\n\n00:06:05.318 --> 00:06:08.414\nand we had in fact access\nto a very nice X-ray video machine\n\n00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:12.014\nfrom Professor Martin Fischer\nin Jena University in Germany.\n\n00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.614\nAnd thanks to that,\nyou really have an amazing machine\n\n00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:17.094\nto record all the bone motion\nin great detail.\n\n00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:18.374\nThat's what we did.\n\n00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:21.574\nSo we basically figured out\nwhich bones are important for us\n\n00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:24.614\nand collected their motion in 3D.\n\n00:06:24.638 --> 00:06:27.334\nAnd what we did is collect\na whole database of motions,\n\n00:06:27.358 --> 00:06:29.014\nboth on ground and in water,\n\n00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:31.522\nto really collect a whole database\nof motor behaviors\n\n00:06:31.547 --> 00:06:32.791\nthat a real animal can do.\n\n00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:35.966\nAnd then our job as roboticists\nwas to replicate that in our robot.\n\n00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.374\nSo we did a whole optimization process\nto find out the right structure,\n\n00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:42.054\nwhere to place the motors,\nhow to connect them together,\n\n00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:44.958\nto be able to replay\nthese motions as well as possible.\n\n00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.998\nAnd this is how Pleurobot came to life.\n\n00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:51.574\nSo let's look at how close\nit is to the real animal.\n\n00:06:52.918 --> 00:06:55.414\nSo what you see here\nis almost a direct comparison\n\n00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:58.134\nbetween the walking\nof the real animal and the Pleurobot.\n\n00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:00.894\nYou can see that we have\nalmost a one-to-one exact replay\n\n00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:02.174\nof the walking gait.\n\n00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:04.798\nIf you go backwards and slowly,\nyou see it even better.\n\n00:07:07.478 --> 00:07:09.854\nBut even better, we can do swimming.\n\n00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:12.894\nSo for that we have a dry suit\nthat we put all over the robot --\n\n00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:14.014\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:17.214\nand then we can go in water\nand start replaying the swimming gaits.\n\n00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:20.574\nAnd here, we were very happy,\nbecause this is difficult to do.\n\n00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:22.814\nThe physics of interaction are complex.\n\n00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:25.254\nOur robot is much bigger\nthan a small animal,\n\n00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.334\nso we had to do what's called\ndynamic scaling of the frequencies\n\n00:07:28.358 --> 00:07:30.694\nto make sure we had\nthe same interaction physics.\n\n00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:33.134\nBut you see at the end,\nwe have a very close match,\n\n00:07:33.158 --> 00:07:35.038\nand we were very, very happy with this.\n\n00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:37.654\nSo let's go to the spinal cord.\n\n00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.974\nSo here what we did\nwith Jean-Marie Cabelguen\n\n00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:42.238\nis model the spinal cord circuits.\n\n00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:45.134\nAnd what's interesting\nis that the salamander\n\n00:07:45.158 --> 00:07:46.778\nhas kept a very primitive circuit,\n\n00:07:46.802 --> 00:07:49.454\nwhich is very similar\nto the one we find in the lamprey,\n\n00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:51.454\nthis primitive eel-like fish,\n\n00:07:51.478 --> 00:07:53.214\nand it looks like during evolution,\n\n00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:56.174\nnew neural oscillators\nhave been added to control the limbs,\n\n00:07:56.198 --> 00:07:57.614\nto do the leg locomotion.\n\n00:07:57.638 --> 00:07:59.814\nAnd we know where\nthese neural oscillators are\n\n00:07:59.838 --> 00:08:02.094\nbut what we did was to make\na mathematical model\n\n00:08:02.118 --> 00:08:03.734\nto see how they should be coupled\n\n00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:06.694\nto allow this transition\nbetween the two very different gaits.\n\n00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:09.278\nAnd we tested that on board of a robot.\n\n00:08:09.638 --> 00:08:10.838\nAnd this is how it looks.\n\n00:08:18.878 --> 00:08:21.894\nSo what you see here\nis a previous version of Pleurobot\n\n00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:25.014\nthat's completely controlled\nby our spinal cord model\n\n00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:26.638\nprogrammed on board of the robot.\n\n00:08:27.238 --> 00:08:28.454\nAnd the only thing we do\n\n00:08:28.478 --> 00:08:30.654\nis send to the robot\nthrough a remote control\n\n00:08:30.678 --> 00:08:33.174\nthe two descending signals\nit normally should receive\n\n00:08:33.198 --> 00:08:34.798\nfrom the upper part of the brain.\n\n00:08:35.438 --> 00:08:38.134\nAnd what's interesting is,\nby playing with these signals,\n\n00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:40.958\nwe can completely control\nspeed, heading and type of gait.\n\n00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:42.774\nFor instance,\n\n00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:46.374\nwhen we stimulate at a low level,\nwe have the walking gait,\n\n00:08:46.398 --> 00:08:48.374\nand at some point, if we stimulate a lot,\n\n00:08:48.398 --> 00:08:50.558\nvery rapidly it switches\nto the swimming gait.\n\n00:08:51.438 --> 00:08:53.654\nAnd finally, we can also\ndo turning very nicely\n\n00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:57.198\nby just stimulating more one side\nof the spinal cord than the other.\n\n00:08:58.158 --> 00:08:59.774\nAnd I think it's really beautiful\n\n00:08:59.798 --> 00:09:02.054\nhow nature has distributed control\n\n00:09:02.078 --> 00:09:04.934\nto really give a lot of responsibility\nto the spinal cord\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.614\nso that the upper part of the brain\ndoesn't need to worry about every muscle.\n\n00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:11.174\nIt just has to worry\nabout this high-level modulation,\n\n00:09:11.198 --> 00:09:14.774\nand it's really the job of the spinal cord\nto coordinate all the muscles.\n\n00:09:14.798 --> 00:09:18.318\nSo now let's go to cat locomotion\nand the importance of biomechanics.\n\n00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:20.294\nSo this is another project\n\n00:09:20.318 --> 00:09:22.734\nwhere we studied cat biomechanics,\n\n00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:26.654\nand we wanted to see how much\nthe morphology helps locomotion.\n\n00:09:26.678 --> 00:09:30.294\nAnd we found three important\ncriteria in the properties,\n\n00:09:30.318 --> 00:09:31.638\nbasically, of the limbs.\n\n00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:34.254\nThe first one is that a cat limb\n\n00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:36.974\nmore or less looks\nlike a pantograph-like structure.\n\n00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:39.214\nSo a pantograph is a mechanical structure\n\n00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:42.638\nwhich keeps the upper segment\nand the lower segments always parallel.\n\n00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:46.654\nSo a simple geometrical system\nthat kind of coordinates a bit\n\n00:09:46.678 --> 00:09:48.494\nthe internal movement of the segments.\n\n00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:51.574\nA second property of cat limbs\nis that they are very lightweight.\n\n00:09:51.598 --> 00:09:53.454\nMost of the muscles are in the trunk,\n\n00:09:53.478 --> 00:09:56.374\nwhich is a good idea,\nbecause then the limbs have low inertia\n\n00:09:56.398 --> 00:09:58.174\nand can be moved very rapidly.\n\n00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:02.014\nThe last final important property is this\nvery elastic behavior of the cat limb,\n\n00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:04.694\nso to handle impacts and forces.\n\n00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:07.054\nAnd this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.\n\n00:10:07.078 --> 00:10:09.278\nSo let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.\n\n00:10:14.118 --> 00:10:17.774\nSo this is Peter Eckert,\nwho does his PhD on this robot,\n\n00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:19.854\nand as you see, it's a cute little robot.\n\n00:10:19.878 --> 00:10:21.134\nIt looks a bit like a toy,\n\n00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:23.214\nbut it was really used\nas a scientific tool\n\n00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:26.534\nto investigate these properties\nof the legs of the cat.\n\n00:10:26.558 --> 00:10:29.174\nSo you see, it's very compliant,\nvery lightweight,\n\n00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:30.454\nand also very elastic,\n\n00:10:30.478 --> 00:10:33.254\nso you can easily press it down\nand it will not break.\n\n00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:34.734\nIt will just jump, in fact.\n\n00:10:34.758 --> 00:10:37.638\nAnd this very elastic property\nis also very important.\n\n00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:41.014\nAnd you also see a bit these properties\n\n00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:43.438\nof these three segments\nof the leg as pantograph.\n\n00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:47.014\nNow, what's interesting\nis that this quite dynamic gait\n\n00:10:47.038 --> 00:10:48.934\nis obtained purely in open loop,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.094\nmeaning no sensors,\nno complex feedback loops.\n\n00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:54.534\nAnd that's interesting, because it means\n\n00:10:54.558 --> 00:10:58.574\nthat just the mechanics\nalready stabilized this quite rapid gait,\n\n00:10:58.598 --> 00:11:02.774\nand that really good mechanics\nalready basically simplify locomotion.\n\n00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:06.094\nTo the extent that we can even\ndisturb a bit locomotion,\n\n00:11:06.118 --> 00:11:07.774\nas you will see in the next video,\n\n00:11:07.798 --> 00:11:11.694\nwhere we can for instance do some exercise\nwhere we have the robot go down a step,\n\n00:11:11.718 --> 00:11:13.334\nand the robot will not fall over,\n\n00:11:13.358 --> 00:11:14.934\nwhich was a surprise for us.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.374\nThis is a small perturbation.\n\n00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:18.814\nI was expecting the robot\nto immediately fall over,\n\n00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:21.274\nbecause there are no sensors,\nno fast feedback loop.\n\n00:11:21.298 --> 00:11:23.494\nBut no, just the mechanics\nstabilized the gait,\n\n00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:25.094\nand the robot doesn't fall over.\n\n00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:28.254\nObviously, if you make the step bigger,\nand if you have obstacles,\n\n00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:31.934\nyou need the full control loops\nand reflexes and everything.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.894\nBut what's important here\nis that just for small perturbation,\n\n00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:36.414\nthe mechanics are right.\n\n00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:38.534\nAnd I think this is\na very important message\n\n00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:40.749\nfrom biomechanics and robotics\nto neuroscience,\n\n00:11:40.773 --> 00:11:45.453\nsaying don't underestimate to what extent\nthe body already helps locomotion.\n\n00:11:47.398 --> 00:11:49.558\nNow, how does this relate\nto human locomotion?\n\n00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:53.558\nClearly, human locomotion is more complex\nthan cat and salamander locomotion,\n\n00:11:54.318 --> 00:11:57.454\nbut at the same time, the nervous system\nof humans is very similar\n\n00:11:57.478 --> 00:11:59.054\nto that of other vertebrates.\n\n00:11:59.078 --> 00:12:00.534\nAnd especially the spinal cord\n\n00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:03.198\nis also the key controller\nfor locomotion in humans.\n\n00:12:03.718 --> 00:12:06.134\nThat's why, if there's a lesion\nof the spinal cord,\n\n00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:07.654\nthis has dramatic effects.\n\n00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:10.454\nThe person can become\nparaplegic or tetraplegic.\n\n00:12:10.478 --> 00:12:12.854\nThis is because the brain\nloses this communication\n\n00:12:12.878 --> 00:12:14.134\nwith the spinal cord.\n\n00:12:14.158 --> 00:12:16.374\nEspecially, it loses\nthis descending modulation\n\n00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:18.318\nto initiate and modulate locomotion.\n\n00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:21.294\nSo a big goal of neuroprosthetics\n\n00:12:21.318 --> 00:12:23.694\nis to be able to reactivate\nthat communication\n\n00:12:23.718 --> 00:12:26.158\nusing electrical or chemical stimulations.\n\n00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:29.734\nAnd there are several teams\nin the world that do exactly that,\n\n00:12:29.758 --> 00:12:30.974\nespecially at EPFL.\n\n00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:33.494\nMy colleagues Gr\u00e9goire Courtine\nand Silvestro Micera,\n\n00:12:33.518 --> 00:12:34.758\nwith whom I collaborate.\n\n00:12:35.918 --> 00:12:39.014\nBut to do this properly,\nit's very important to understand\n\n00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:40.774\nhow the spinal cord works,\n\n00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:42.494\nhow it interacts with the body,\n\n00:12:42.518 --> 00:12:44.998\nand how the brain\ncommunicates with the spinal cord.\n\n00:12:45.758 --> 00:12:48.654\nThis is where the robots\nand models that I've presented today\n\n00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:50.574\nwill hopefully play a key role\n\n00:12:50.598 --> 00:12:53.254\ntowards these very important goals.\n\n00:12:53.278 --> 00:12:54.494\nThank you.\n\n00:12:54.518 --> 00:12:59.078\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:06.694\nBruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen\nin your lab other robots\n\n00:13:06.718 --> 00:13:09.174\nthat do things like swim in pollution\n\n00:13:09.198 --> 00:13:11.654\nand measure the pollution while they swim.\n\n00:13:11.678 --> 00:13:12.894\nBut for this one,\n\n00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:16.398\nyou mentioned in your talk,\nlike a side project,\n\n00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:18.814\nsearch and rescue,\n\n00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:21.014\nand it does have a camera on its nose.\n\n00:13:21.038 --> 00:13:23.534\nAuke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --\n\n00:13:23.558 --> 00:13:24.987\nWe have some spin-off projects\n\n00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:28.454\nwhere we would like to use the robots\nto do search and rescue inspection,\n\n00:13:28.478 --> 00:13:30.054\nso this robot is now seeing you.\n\n00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:33.254\nAnd the big dream is to,\nif you have a difficult situation\n\n00:13:33.278 --> 00:13:36.894\nlike a collapsed building\nor a building that is flooded,\n\n00:13:36.918 --> 00:13:40.254\nand this is very dangerous\nfor a rescue team or even rescue dogs,\n\n00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:43.174\nwhy not send in a robot\nthat can crawl around, swim, walk,\n\n00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:46.374\nwith a camera onboard\nto do inspection and identify survivors\n\n00:13:46.398 --> 00:13:49.174\nand possibly create\na communication link with the survivor.\n\n00:13:49.198 --> 00:13:52.774\nBG: Of course, assuming the survivors\ndon't get scared by the shape of this.\n\n00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:56.094\nAI: Yeah, we should probably\nchange the appearance quite a bit,\n\n00:13:56.118 --> 00:13:58.934\nbecause here I guess a survivor\nmight die of a heart attack\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.494\njust of being worried\nthat this would feed on you.\n\n00:14:01.518 --> 00:14:04.374\nBut by changing the appearance\nand it making it more robust,\n\n00:14:04.398 --> 00:14:06.454\nI'm sure we can make\na good tool out of it.\n\n00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:08.764\nBG: Thank you very much.\nThank you and your team."}, {"title": "Our campaign to ban plastic bags in Bali", "duration": "660", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/melati_and_isabel_wijsen_our_campaign_to_ban_plastic_bags_in_bali", "transcript": "Melati Wijsen: Bali \u2014 island of gods.Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.MW: Or ... a paradise lost. Bali: island of garbage.IW: In Bali, we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day. That's about a 14-story building. And when it comes to plastic bags, less than five percent gets recycled.MW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island. It changed ours, too, when we learned about it, when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean. And those that don't even make it to the ocean, they're either burned or littered.IW: So we decided to do something about it. And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island. And we have had some significant successes.MW: We are sisters, and we go to the best school on earth: Green School, Bali. Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo, but also in the way that it teaches. We are taught to become leaders of today, something a normal textbook cannot match.IW: One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people, like Nelson Mandela, Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi. Walking home that day, we agreed that we also wanted to be significant. Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant? We wanted to do something now.MW: Sitting on the sofa that night, we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali. And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage. But that is a huge problem. So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids: plastic bags. And the idea was born.IW: We started researching, and let's just say, the more we learned, there was nothing good about plastic bags. And you know what? We don't even need them.MW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places, from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.IW: And so the idea turned into the launch of \"Bye Bye Plastic Bags.\" MW: In the years that we have been campaigning, we have learned a lot.Lesson number one: you cannot do it all by yourself. You need a big team of like-minded kids, and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew. The volunteer team includes children from all over the island, from both international and local schools. And together with them, we started a multi-layered approach, based on an on- and off-line signature petition, educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups. And last but not least, we distribute alternative bags, bags like net bags, recycled newspaper bags or 100 percent organic material bags, all made by local initiatives on the island.IW: We run a pilot village, home of 800 families. The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped. We focused on making the customers aware, because that's where the change needs to happen. The village is already two-thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free.Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed. So we thought, \"Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures. They can't ignore us, right?\"MW: Right!IW: But, who would have guessed one million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?(Laughter)We got stuck \u2014 till we learned lesson number two: think outside the box. Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.MW: But how do we get into the airport? And here comes lesson number three: persistence. Off we headed to the airport. We got past the janitor. And then it was his boss's boss, and then the assistant office manager, and then the office manager, and then ... we got shuffled down two levels and thought, well, here comes the janitor again.And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission, we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports. And we gave him the \"Bali of plastic bags\" speech, and being a very nice man, he said, [imitating the man's voice] \"I cannot believe what I'm about say, but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations.\"(Laughter)(Applause)IW: In our first hour and a half there, we got almost 1,000 signatures. How cool is that?Lesson number four: you need champions at all levels of society, from students to commercial managers to famous people. And thanks to the attraction of Green School, we had access to a steady stream of celebrities. Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary-Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions \u2014(Laughter)even if kids ask nicely. But he promised to spread the word, and now we work closely with the United Nations.MW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network. She started with just one Roots & Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world. We are one of them. She's a real inspiration.If you're a fellow Rotarian, nice to meet you. We're Interactors, the youngest department of Rotary International.IW: But we have also learned much about patience,MW: how to deal with frustrations,IW: leadership,MW: teamwork,IW: friendship,MW: we learned more about the Balinese and their cultureIW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.MW: It's not always easy. Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.IW: But last year, we did exactly that. We went to India to give a talk, and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi. We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals. Yes, by the end of the tour, when we met our parents again, we both made a decision and said, \"We're going on a hunger strike!\"(Laughter)MW: And you can probably imagine their faces. It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well. Isabel and I were serious about doing this. So we met with a nutritionist, and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.IW: Our \"mogak makan,\" as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia, started. We used social media to support our goal and already on day two, police started to come to our home and school. What were these two girls doing? We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike \u2014 we could have gone to jail. But, hey, it worked. Twenty-four hours later, we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor.MW: And there he was \u2014(Applause)waiting for us to meet and speak, being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags. And we are now friends, and on a regular basis, we remind him and his team of the promises he has made. And indeed, recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.(Applause)IW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public.IW: Our short-term campaign, \"One Island / One Voice,\" is all about this. We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone, and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali. And conversely, that highlights those who do not have the sticker.(Laughter)MW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this? Well, partly, it is because we are proud of the results that, together with our team, we have been able to reach. But also because along the way, we have learned that kids can do things. We can make things happen. Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old when we started this. We never had a business plan, nor a fixed strategy, nor any hidden agendas \u2014 just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us. All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home. Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs.IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world: go for it! Make that difference. We're not telling you it's going to be easy. We're telling you it's going to be worth it. Us kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population, but we are 100 percent of the future.MW: We still have a lot of work to do, but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will beBoth: \"Welcome to Bali, do you have nay plastic bags to declare?\"(Laughter)Om shanti shanti shanti om.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2418, "subtitle":

"https://www.ted.com/talks/linda_liukas_a_delightful_way_to_teach_kids_about_computers", "transcript": "Code is the next universal language. In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation. In the eighties, it was probably money. But for my generation of people, software is the interface to our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically, radically more diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist, and so forth.My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow express all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving.And that is how programming started for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like, \"What?\" and \"Why?\" and \"How?\" and \"What if?\" And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as, say, nuclear physics.And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, \"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\" Or, \"How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?\" Or, \"Linda, is Internet a place?\" We adults, we grow oddly silent. \"It's magic,\" some of us say. \"It's too complicated,\" the others say.Well, it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened really, really, really fast. Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them very, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces.And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs, I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it.The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools to build with computers, we are raising only consumers instead of creators.This whole quest led me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, \"What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?\", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together. And Ruby also introduced me to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on.In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play. And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, \"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump.\" And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times. And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids these four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, \"Which one of these do you think is a computer?\" And the kids would be very conservative and go, \"None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time.\" But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog \u2014 a dog might not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system and the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. (Laughter)And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids, \"Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer.\" And again, the kids go, \"Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this.\" But I tell them, \"Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer, either. They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer.\"And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, \"This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors.\" And I said, \"That's a really good idea, what else could it do?\" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, \"If this bicycle lamp were a computer, we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector.\" And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change.Final story, we also built a computer. And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled our computer together, we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut. And the boy, he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application. And his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth. And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology.Finally, the more approachable, the more inclusive, and the more diverse we make the world of technology, the more colorful and better the world will look like. So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don't only include the twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology. They embrace the powers and the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird.When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley. In the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories, I do them with code.Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2417, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.678 -->

eighties, it was probably money.\n\n00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:25.654\nBut for my generation of people,\n\n00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:30.494\nsoftware is the interface\nto our imagination and our world.\n\n00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:32.214\nAnd that means that we need\n\n00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:35.494\na radically, radically\nmore diverse set of people\n\n00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:37.294\nto build those products,\n\n00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:42.254\nto not see computers as mechanical\nand lonely and boring and magic,\n\n00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:44.254\nto see them as things\nthat they can tinker\n\n00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.718\nand turn around and twist,\nand so forth.\n\n00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:51.454\nMy personal journey into the world\nof programming and technology\n\n00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:54.454\nstarted at the tender age of 14.\n\n00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:58.574\nI had this mad teenage crush\non an older man,\n\n00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:00.934\nand the older man in question\njust happened to be\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:05.374\nthe then Vice President\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore.\n\n00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.454\nAnd I did what every single\nteenage girl would want to do.\n\n00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:10.694\nI wanted to somehow\nexpress all of this love,\n\n00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.294\nso I built him a website, it's over here.\n\n00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:16.254\nAnd in 2001, there was no Tumblr,\n\n00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.534\nthere was no Facebook,\nthere was no Pinterest.\n\n00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:20.694\nSo I needed to learn to code\n\n00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:24.094\nin order to express\nall of this longing and loving.\n\n00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:26.454\nAnd that is how programming\nstarted for me.\n\n00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:29.014\nIt started as a means of self-expression.\n\n00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:32.654\nJust like when I was smaller,\nI would use crayons and legos.\n\n00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:37.278\nAnd when I was older, I would use\nguitar lessons and theater plays.\n\n00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:40.854\nBut then, there were other things\nto get excited about,\n\n00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:43.294\nlike poetry and knitting socks\n\n00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:46.614\nand conjugating French irregular verbs\n\n00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:48.494\nand coming up with make-believe worlds\n\n00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:51.654\nand Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.\n\n00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.574\nAnd I started to be one of those people\n\n00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:57.278\nwho felt that computers\nare boring and technical and lonely.\n\n00:01:58.078 --> 00:01:59.894\nHere's what I think today.\n\n00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:03.974\nLittle girls don't know that they\nare not supposed to like computers.\n\n00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.254\nLittle girls are amazing.\n\n00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:09.414\nThey are really, really good\nat concentrating on things\n\n00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:12.694\nand being exact and they ask\namazing questions like,\n\n00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:15.294\n\"What?\" and \"Why?\"\nand \"How?\" and \"What if?\"\n\n00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:18.998\nAnd they don't know that they\nare not supposed to like computers.\n\n00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:21.654\nIt's the parents who do.\n\n00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:22.973\nIt's us parents who feel\n\n00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:28.094\nlike computer science\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline\n\n00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:31.774\nthat only belongs to the mystery makers.\n\n00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:34.534\nThat it's almost as far removed\nfrom everyday life\n\n00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:37.094\nas, say, nuclear physics.\n\n00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:39.574\nAnd they are partly right about that.\n\n00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:43.094\nThere's a lot of syntax\nand controls and data structures\n\n00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:45.774\nand algorithms and practices,\n\n00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.374\nprotocols and paradigms in programming.\n\n00:02:48.398 -->

toilet.\n\n00:06:33.238 --> 00:06:36.478\nAnd I would ask, \"Which one of these\ndo you think is a computer?\"\n\n00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:40.174\nAnd the kids would be\nvery conservative and go,\n\n00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:41.974\n\"None of these is a computer.\n\n00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:43.654\nI know what a computer is:\n\n00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:45.014\nit's that glowing box\n\n00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:48.654\nin front of which mom or dad\nspends way too much time.\"\n\n00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:50.174\nBut then we would talk\n\n00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:53.014\nand we would discover\nthat actually, a car is a computer,\n\n00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:55.414\nit has a navigation system inside of it.\n\n00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:58.214\nAnd a dog -- a dog\nmight not be a computer,\n\n00:06:58.238 --> 00:06:59.454\nbut it has a collar\n\n00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:02.094\nand the collar might have\na computer inside of it.\n\n00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:05.574\nAnd grocery stores, they have\nso many different kinds of computers,\n\n00:07:05.598 --> 00:07:09.014\nlike the cashier system\nand the burglar alarms.\n\n00:07:09.038 --> 00:07:10.374\nAnd kids, you know what?\n\n00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:12.934\nIn Japan, toilets are computers\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.854\nand there's even hackers who hack them.\n\n00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:16.654\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:17.894\nAnd we go further\n\n00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:21.134\nand I give them these little stickers\nwith an on/off button on them.\n\n00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:24.774\nAnd I tell the kids,\n\"Today you have this magic ability\n\n00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:28.414\nto make anything in this room\ninto a computer.\"\n\n00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:29.774\nAnd again, the kids go,\n\n00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:32.694\n\"Sounds really hard,\nI don't know the right answer for this.\"\n\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.294\nBut I tell them, \"Don't worry,\n\n00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:36.894\nyour parents don't know\nthe right answer, either.\n\n00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:39.134\nThey've just started\nto hear about this thing\n\n00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:41.374\ncalled The Internet of Things.\n\n00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:43.374\nBut you kids,\nyou are going to be the ones\n\n00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:47.774\nwho are really going to live up in a world\nwhere everything is a computer.\"\n\n00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:50.014\nAnd then I had this little girl\nwho came to me\n\n00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:51.334\nand took a bicycle lamp\n\n00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:55.574\nand she said, \"This bicycle lamp,\nif it were a computer,\n\n00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:57.614\nit would change colors.\"\n\n00:07:57.638 --> 00:08:00.654\nAnd I said, \"That's a really good idea,\nwhat else could it do?\"\n\n00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:02.414\nAnd she thinks and she thinks,\n\n00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:06.454\nand she goes, \"If this bicycle lamp\nwere a computer,\n\n00:08:06.478 --> 00:08:09.214\nwe could go on a biking trip\nwith my father\n\n00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:10.854\nand we would sleep in a tent\n\n00:08:10.878 --> 00:08:14.718\nand this biking lamp\ncould also be a movie projector.\"\n\n00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:17.558\nAnd that's the moment I'm looking for,\n\n00:08:18.358 --> 00:08:19.934\nthe moment when the kid realizes\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.334\nthat the world\nis definitely not ready yet,\n\n00:08:22.358 --> 00:08:25.334\nthat a really awesome way\nof making the world more ready\n\n00:08:25.358 --> 00:08:27.574\nis by building technology\n\n00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:30.358\nand that each one of us\ncan be a part of that change.\n\n00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:34.214\nFinal story, we also built a computer.\n\n00:08:34.238 --> 00:08:38.974\nAnd we got to know the bossy CPU\nand the helpful RAM and ROM\n\n00:08:38.998 --> 00:08:40.414\nthat help it remember things.\n\n00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:43.374\nAnd after we've assembled\nour computer together,\n\n00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.054\nwe also design an application for it.\n\n00:08:46.078 --> 00:08:48.093\nAnd my favorite story is this little boy,\n\n00:08:48.117 --> 00:08:49.374\nhe's six years old\n\n00:08:49.398 --> 00:08:52.517\nand his favorite thing in the world\nis to be an astronaut.\n\n00:08:53.078 --> 00:08:55.334\nAnd the boy, he has\nthese huge headphones on\n\n00:08:55.358 --> 00:08:58.614\nand he's completely immersed\nin his tiny paper computer\n\n00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.654\nbecause you see, he's built his own\n\n00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:04.974\nintergalactic planetary\nnavigation application.\n\n00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:08.134\nAnd his father, the lone astronaut\nin the Martian orbit,\n\n00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:10.014\nis on the other side of the room\n\n00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:11.654\nand the boy's important mission\n\n00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:14.598\nis to bring the father\nsafely back to earth.\n\n00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:19.174\nAnd these kids are going to have\na profoundly different view of the world\n\n00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:21.598\nand the way we build it with technology.\n\n00:09:22.798 --> 00:09:26.654\nFinally, the more approachable,\nthe more inclusive,\n\n00:09:26.678 --> 00:09:30.054\nand the more diverse\nwe make the world of technology,\n\n00:09:30.078 --> 00:09:34.054\nthe more colorful and better\nthe world will look like.\n\n00:09:34.078 --> 00:09:36.654\nSo, imagine with me, for a moment,\n\n00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:39.254\na world where the stories we tell\n\n00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:42.294\nabout how things get made\ndon't only include\n\n00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:44.734\nthe twentysomething-year-old\nSilicon Valley boys,\n\n00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:49.158\nbut also Kenyan schoolgirls\nand Norwegian librarians.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.174\nImagine a world where\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,\n\n00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:57.414\nwho live in a permanent\nreality of 1s and 0s,\n\n00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:02.054\nthey grow up to be very optimistic\nand brave about technology.\n\n00:10:02.078 --> 00:10:05.454\nThey embrace the powers\nand the opportunities\n\n00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:07.078\nand the limitations of the world.\n\n00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:11.774\nA world of technology\nthat is wonderful, whimsical\n\n00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:13.438\nand a tiny bit weird.\n\n00:10:15.078 --> 00:10:16.574\nWhen I was a girl,\n\n00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:18.614\nI wanted to be a storyteller.\n\n00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:20.214\nI loved make-believe worlds\n\n00:10:20.238 --> 00:10:21.854\nand my favorite thing to do\n\n00:10:21.878 --> 00:10:25.934\nwas to wake up in the mornings\nin Moominvalley.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.078\nIn the afternoons,\nI would roam around the Tatooines.\n\n00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:32.158\nAnd in the evenings,\nI would go to sleep in Narnia.\n\n00:10:33.358 --> 00:10:36.558\nAnd programming turned out\nto be the perfect profession for me.\n\n00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:39.614\nI still create worlds.\n\n00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:42.598\nInstead of stories, I do them with code.\n\n00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:46.654\nProgramming gives me this amazing power\n\n00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:49.054\nto build my whole little universe\n\n00:10:49.078 --> 00:10:53.038\nwith its own rules\nand paradigms and practices.\n\n00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:58.038\nCreate something out of nothing\nwith the pure power of logic.\n\n00:10:58.878 --> 00:11:00.094\nThank you.\n\n00:11:00.118 -->

boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed. Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich, and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory. They would go into towns and ask the Inca, \"Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?\"And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them, \"Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact, there is a city called Paititi \u2014 El Dorado in Spanish \u2014 made entirely of gold.\"The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled.All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU, trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential, when I remember this legend, and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist?I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was a unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, but they're generally associated with volcanoes. You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation. And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes, we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in most of Peru. So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.Telling this same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, \"But no, Andr\u00e9s, I've been there. I've swum in that river.\"(Laughter)Then my uncle jumps in. \"No, Andr\u00e9s, she's not kidding. You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain, and it's protected by a powerful shaman. Your aunt, she's friends with his wife.\"(Laughter)\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo?\" [\"Huh?\"]You know, despite all my scientific skepticism, I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center, and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary \"warm stream of the Amazon.\"But then ... I heard something, a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer. It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing, and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees. And then, I saw this.I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, and the average temperatures in the river were 86 degrees C. This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling but definitely close enough. The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre \u2014 It starts off as a cold stream. And here, at this site, is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring, mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life.The next morning, I woke up and \u2014(Laughter)I asked for tea. I was handed a mug, a tea bag and, well, pointed towards the river. To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste, which is a little weird for geothermal systems.What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place, and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water. They take in its vapor. They cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it.I met the shaman, and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle. He asked for my intentions and listened carefully. Then, to my tremendous relief \u2014 I was freaking out, to be honest with you \u2014 a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.(Laughter)I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river, on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab, wherever I was in the world, that I pour the waters back into the ground so that, as the shaman said, the waters could find their way back home.I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011, and the fieldwork has been exhilarating, demanding and at times dangerous. One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine. I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts, in between an 80 degree C river and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling. And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest. Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing. The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout. Intense.Now, after years of work, I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage, for the first time, some of these discoveries.Well, first off, it's not a legend. Surprise!(Laughter)When I first started the research, the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful. There were just no good maps. Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team, I now have this. Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, \"boiled with the heat of the sun,\" indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils, and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us.So why does the river boil?(Bubbling sounds)It actually took me three years to get that footage.Fault-fed hot springs. As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries, so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults. Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries, we'll get geothermal manifestations: fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place. Next time you cross the road, think about this. The river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path. It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers. Truly impressive. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage, and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall \u2014 and all with near-boiling water.We mapped the temperatures along the river, and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork. And the results were just awesome. Sorry \u2014 the geoscientist in me coming out. And it showed this amazing trend. You see, the river starts off cold. It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down, heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river.Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists, so to put it in more everyday terms: Everyone loves coffee. Yes? Good. Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C, an extra-hot one, well, 60. So, put in coffee shop terms, the boiling river plots like this. There you have your hot coffee. Here you have your extra-hot coffee, and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee. And these are average water temperatures. We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.But there's a magic number here that's not being shown, and that number is 47 degrees C, because that's where things start to hurt, and I know this from very personal experience. Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water. You need to be careful. It can be deadly.I've seen all sorts of animals fall in, and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same. So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes. Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly. They turn this milky-white color. The stream is carrying them. They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot. So they're losing power, losing power, until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out.(Laughter)A bit sadistic, aren't we? Jeez. Leave them marinating for a little longer. What's, again, amazing are these temperatures. They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.But here's the thing: the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism. It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin, and again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center.How can a boiling river exist like this? I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. So, still \u2014 how does it work? Where do we get this heat? There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system, but from what the data is telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system.Basically, it works like this: So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, all due to this unique geologic setting.Now, we found that in and around the river \u2014 this is working with colleagues from National Geographic, Dr. Spencer Wells, and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis \u2014 we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms, unique species living in the boiling river.But again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends, a question remains: What is the significance of the boiling river? What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle? And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend?To the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site. To me, as a geoscientist, it's a unique geothermal phenomenon. But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers, it's just another resource to exploit. And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development.My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance. Because that's the question, one of significance. And the thing there is, we define significance. It's us. We have that power. We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial. And in this age, where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data.There remains so much to explore. We live in an incredible world. So go out. Be curious. Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2424, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.624\nAs a boy in Lima,\n\n00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.759\nmy grandfather told me a legend\n\n00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.037\nof the Spanish conquest of Peru.\n\n00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:23.504\nAtahualpa, emperor of the Inca,\nhad been captured and killed.\n\n00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:26.511\nPizarro and his conquistadors\nhad grown rich,\n\n00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.721\nand tales of their conquest\nand glory had reached Spain\n\n00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:35.120\nand was bringing new waves of Spaniards,\nhungry for gold and glory.\n\n00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:38.911\nThey would go into towns and ask the Inca,\n\n00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:42.710\n\"Where's another civilization\nwe can conquer?

00:02:32.206\n\"But no, Andr\u00e9s, I've been there.\nI've swum in that river.\"\n\n00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:36.493\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:38.264\nThen my uncle jumps in.\n\n00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:41.018\n\"No, Andr\u00e9s, she's not kidding.\n\n00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:45.025\nYou see, you can only swim in it\nafter a very heavy rain,\n\n00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.295\nand it's protected by a powerful shaman.\n\n00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.636\nYour aunt, she's friends with his wife.\"\n\n00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:53.020\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:54.195\n\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo?\" [\"Huh?\"]\n\n00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.433\nYou know, despite all\nmy scientific skepticism,\n\n00:02:56.457 --> 00:03:00.889\nI found myself hiking into the jungle,\nguided by my aunt,\n\n00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:04.810\nover 700 kilometers away\nfrom the nearest volcanic center,\n\n00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:08.452\nand well, honestly,\nmentally preparing myself\n\n00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:12.852\nto behold the legendary\n\"warm stream of the Amazon.\"\n\n00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.250\nBut then ...\n\n00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:17.596\nI heard something,\n\n00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:20.662\na low surge\n\n00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:25.000\nthat got louder and louder\n\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.218\nas we came closer.\n\n00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:32.186\nIt sounded like ocean waves\nconstantly crashing,\n\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.895\nand as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,\ncoming up through the trees.\n\n00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.218\nAnd then, I saw this.\n\n00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.218\nI immediately grabbed for my thermometer,\n\n00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:47.519\nand the average temperatures in the river\n\n00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:49.530\nwere 86 degrees C.\n\n00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.765\nThis is not quite\nthe 100-degree C boiling\n\n00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.666\nbut definitely close enough.\n\n00:03:58.254 --> 00:04:01.346\nThe river flowed hot and fast.\n\n00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.787\nI followed it upriver and was led by,\nactually, the shaman's apprentice\n\n00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.595\nto the most sacred site on the river.\n\n00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.025\nAnd this is what's bizarre --\n\n00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.031\nIt starts off as a cold stream.\n\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.697\nAnd here, at this site,\n\n00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.888\nis the home of the Yacumama,\n\n00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:19.255\nmother of the waters,\na giant serpent spirit\n\n00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.352\nwho births hot and cold water.\n\n00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:26.385\nAnd here we find a hot spring,\n\n00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:31.767\nmixing with cold stream water\nunderneath her protective motherly jaws\n\n00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:35.036\nand thus bringing their legends to life.\n\n00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:38.219\nThe next morning, I woke up and --\n\n00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:40.462\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:42.517\nI asked for tea.\n\n00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:44.781\nI was handed a mug, a tea bag\n\n00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:47.133\nand, well, pointed towards the river.\n\n00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:52.542\nTo my surprise, the water was clean\nand had a pleasant taste,\n\n00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:55.560\nwhich is a little weird\nfor geothermal systems.\n\n00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.947\nWhat was amazing\n\n00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:00.955\nis that the locals had always\nknown about this place,\n\n00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.683\nand that I was by no means\nthe first outsider to see it.\n\n00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.596\nIt was just part of their everyday life.\n\n00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:11.767\nThey drink its water.\n\n00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.346\nThey take in its vapor.\n\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.061\nThey cook with it,\n\n00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:17.595\nclean with it,\n\n00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:19.417\neven make their medicines with it.\n\n00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:22.798\nI met the shaman,\n\n00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:27.011\nand he seemed like an extension\nof the river and his jungle.\n\n00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:29.630\nHe asked for my intentions\n\n00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:32.146\nand listened carefully.\n\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.331\nThen, to my tremendous relief --\n\n00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:39.902\nI was freaking out,\nto be honest with you --\n\n00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:44.205\na smile began to snake across his face,\nand he just laughed.\n\n00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.526\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:52.349\nI had received the shaman's blessing\nto study the river,\n\n00:05:52.373 --> 00:05:55.777\non the condition that after I take\nthe water samples\n\n00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:57.317\nand analyze them in my lab,\n\n00:05:57.341 --> 00:05:59.151\nwherever I was in the world,\n\n00:06:00.223 --> 00:06:03.989\nthat I pour the waters\nback into the ground\n\n00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:06.060\nso that, as the shaman said,\n\n00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:08.829\nthe waters could find their way back home.\n\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.817\nI've been back every year\nsince that first visit in 2011,\n\n00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.266\nand the fieldwork has been exhilarating,\n\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.087\ndemanding and at times dangerous.\n\n00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:26.086\nOne story was even featured\nin National Geographic Magazine.\n\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.197\nI was trapped on a small rock\nabout the size of a sheet of paper\n\n00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:32.261\nin sandals and board shorts,\n\n00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:34.691\nin between an 80 degree C river\n\n00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:38.444\nand a hot spring that, well,\nlooked like this, close to boiling.\n\n00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:42.566\nAnd on top of that,\nit was Amazon rain forest.\n\n00:06:43.164 --> 00:06:45.670\nPshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.\n\n00:06:45.694 --> 00:06:49.256\nThe temperature differential\nmade it all white. It was a whiteout.\n\n00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:52.319\nIntense.\n\n00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:56.554\nNow, after years of work,\n\n00:06:56.578 --> 00:07:02.220\nI'll soon be submitting my geophysical\nand geochemical studies for publication.\n\n00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:06.980\nAnd I'd like to share, today,\nwith all of you here, on the TED stage,\n\n00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:10.194\nfor the first time,\nsome of these discoveries.\n\n00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:13.829\nWell, first off, it's not a legend.\n\n00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:15.600\nSurprise!\n\n00:07:15.624 --> 00:07:17.949\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:20.487\nWhen I first started the research,\n\n00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:23.490\nthe satellite imagery was too\nlow-resolution to be meaningful.\n\n00:07:23.514 --> 00:07:25.142\nThere were just no good maps.\n\n00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.103\nThanks to the support\nof the Google Earth team,\n\n00:07:28.127 --> 00:07:29.472\nI now have this.\n\n00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:36.559\nNot only that, the indigenous name\nof the river, Shanay-timpishka,\n\n00:07:37.496 --> 00:07:40.226\n\"boiled with the heat of the sun,\"\n\n00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:46.877\nindicating that I'm not the first\nto wonder why the river boils,\n\n00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:50.128\nand showing that humanity\nhas always sought to explain\n\n00:07:50.152 --> 00:07:51.691\nthe world around us.\n\n00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:55.882\nSo why does the river boil?\n\n00:07:55.906 --> 00:08:00.319\n(Bubbling sounds)\n\n00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:02.838\nIt actually took me three years\nto get that footage.\n\n00:08:04.837 --> 00:08:06.442\nFault-fed hot springs.\n\n00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:11.216\nAs we have hot blood running\nthrough our veins and arteries,\n\n00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.288\nso, too, the earth has hot water\nrunning through its cracks and faults.\n\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.715\nWhere these arteries come to the surface,\nthese earth arteries,\n\n00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:23.113\nwe'll get geothermal manifestations:\n\n00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:27.157\nfumaroles, hot springs\nand in our case, the boiling river.\n\n00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:32.517\nWhat's truly incredible, though,\nis the scale of this place.\n\n00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.525\nNext time you cross the road,\nthink about this.\n\n00:08:36.485 --> 00:08:39.157\nThe river flows wider than a two-lane road\n\n00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:41.045\nalong most of its path.\n\n00:08:41.632 --> 00:08:46.975\nIt flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.\n\n00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:49.690\nTruly impressive.\n\n00:08:51.035 --> 00:08:54.035\nThere are thermal pools\nlarger than this TED stage,\n\n00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:56.535\nand that waterfall that you see there\n\n00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.597\nis six meters tall --\n\n00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:02.634\nand all with near-boiling water.\n\n00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:06.257\nWe mapped the temperatures\nalong the river,\n\n00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:09.399\nand this was by far the most\ndemanding part of the fieldwork.\n\n00:09:09.824 --> 00:09:13.511\nAnd the results were just awesome.\n\n00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:16.688\nSorry -- the geoscientist\nin me coming out.\n\n00:09:16.712 --> 00:09:19.138\nAnd it showed this amazing trend.\n\n00:09:19.162 --> 00:09:21.378\nYou see, the river starts off cold.\n\n00:09:21.402 --> 00:09:24.397\nIt then heats up, cools back down,\nheats up, cools back down,\n\n00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.039\nheats up again, and then has\nthis beautiful decay curve\n\n00:09:27.063 --> 00:09:29.435\nuntil it smashes into this cold river.\n\n00:09:30.497 --> 00:09:33.291\nNow, I understand not all of you\nare geothermal scientists,\n\n00:09:33.315 --> 00:09:35.540\nso to put it in more everyday terms:\n\n00:09:36.183 --> 00:09:38.316\nEveryone loves coffee.\n\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.609\nYes? Good.\n\n00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:44.158\nYour regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,\n\n00:09:44.182 --> 00:09:46.292\nan extra-hot one, well, 60.\n\n00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:49.025\nSo, put in coffee shop terms,\n\n00:09:49.049 --> 00:09:51.612\nthe boiling river plots like this.\n\n00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:53.858\nThere you have your hot coffee.\n\n00:09:54.864 --> 00:09:56.588\nHere you have your extra-hot coffee,\n\n00:09:56.612 --> 00:09:58.786\nand you can see\nthat there's a bit point there\n\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.798\nwhere the river is still hotter\nthan even the extra-hot coffee.\n\n00:10:01.822 --> 00:10:03.814\nAnd these are average water temperatures.\n\n00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:08.037\nWe took these in the dry season to ensure\nthe purest geothermal temperatures.\n\n00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:11.181\nBut there's a magic number here\nthat's not being shown,\n\n00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:13.735\nand that number is 47 degrees C,\n\n00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:17.336\nbecause that's where things start to hurt,\n\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.533\nand I know this from very\npersonal experience.\n\n00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:24.970\nAbove that temperature,\nyou don't want to get in that water.\n\n00:10:24.994 --> 00:10:26.656\nYou need to be careful.\n\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.995\nIt can be deadly.\n\n00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.953\nI've seen all sorts of animals fall in,\n\n00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:35.156\nand what's shocking to me,\nis the process is pretty much the same.\n\n00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:38.537\nSo they fall in and the first thing\nto go are the eyes.\n\n00:10:38.561 --> 00:10:41.928\nEyes, apparently, cook very quickly.\nThey turn this milky-white color.\n\n00:10:41.952 --> 00:10:43.302\nThe stream is carrying them.\n\n00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:46.389\nThey're trying to swim out,\nbut their meat is cooking on the bone\n\n00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.579\nbecause it's so hot.\n\n00:10:47.603 --> 00:10:49.448\nSo they're losing power, losing power,\n\n00:10:49.472 --> 00:10:52.862\nuntil finally they get to a point\nwhere hot water goes into their mouths\n\n00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.107\nand they cook from the inside out.\n\n00:10:55.398 --> 00:11:00.630\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:02.773\nA bit sadistic, aren't we?\n\n00:11:02.797 --> 00:11:04.137\nJeez.\n\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.938\nLeave them marinating for a little longer.\n\n00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:12.154\nWhat's, again, amazing\nare these temperatures.\n\n00:11:12.178 --> 00:11:15.656\nThey're similar to things that I've seen\non volcanoes all over the world\n\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.217\nand even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.\n\n00:11:18.854 --> 00:11:20.162\nBut here's the thing:\n\n00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:27.130\nthe data is showing\nthat the boiling river exists\n\n00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:29.444\nindependent of volcanism.\n\n00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:33.869\nIt's neither magmatic\nor volcanic in origin,\n\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.883\nand again, over 700 kilometers away\nfrom the nearest volcanic center.\n\n00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:46.867\nHow can a boiling river exist like this?\n\n00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.904\nI've asked geothermal experts\nand volcanologists for years,\n\n00:11:50.928 --> 00:11:55.745\nand I'm still unable to find another\nnon-volcanic geothermal system\n\n00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:57.336\nof this magnitude.\n\n00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:00.603\nIt's unique.\n\n00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:04.889\nIt's special on a global scale.\n\n00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:09.134\nSo, still -- how does it work?\n\n00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:12.554\nWhere do we get this heat?\n\n00:12:13.144 --> 00:12:15.237\nThere's still more research to be done\n\n00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:18.450\nto better constrain the problem\nand better understand the system,\n\n00:12:18.474 --> 00:12:20.800\nbut from what the data is telling us now,\n\n00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:24.188\nit looks to be the result\nof a large hydrothermal system.\n\n00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:26.569\nBasically, it works like this:\n\n00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:29.901\nSo, the deeper you go\ninto the earth, the hotter it gets.\n\n00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:32.553\nWe refer to this\nas the geothermal gradient.\n\n00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:38.346\nThe waters could be coming\nfrom as far away as glaciers in the

Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important.So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something \u2014 like maybe this talk \u2014 at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed.So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man.This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, \"Calories! ... Survival!\" We eat the food, we taste it \u2014 it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal to our brain that says, \"Remember what you're eating and where you found it.\" We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward.Simple, right? Well, after a while, our creative brains say, \"You know what? You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?\" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better.Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal \u2014 feeling sad \u2014 triggers that urge to eat.Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, \"Hey, I want to be cool.\" So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet.Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience?I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them had tried this before and failed \u2014 on average, six times.Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, \"Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do.\"And what did they notice? Well here's an example from one of our smokers. She said, \"Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!\" Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit.(Laughter)Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition to control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful.Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves.When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level \u2014 to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones.The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding.What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations \u2014 oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness \u2014 and that these body sensations come and go. These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving that we choke on.In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works.And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride.In contrast, when we let go \u2014 step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening \u2014 this same brain region quiets down.Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it.Instead of see text message, compulsively text back, feel a little bit better \u2014 notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2420, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:14.574\nWhen I was first learning to meditate,\n\n00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.654\nthe instruction was to simply\npay attention to my breath,\n\n00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:19.758\nand when my mind wandered,\nto bring it back.\n\n00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:21.958\nSounded simple enough.\n\n00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.854\nYet I'd sit on these silent retreats,\n\n00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:29.214\nsweating through T-shirts\nin the middle of winter.\n\n00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:32.574\nI'd take naps every chance I got\nbecause it was really hard work.\n\n00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:34.598\nActually, it was exhausting.\n\n00:00:35.358 --> 00:00:37.094\nThe instruction was simple enough\n\n00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:39.238\nbut I was missing something\nreally important.\n\n00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.518\nSo why is it so hard to pay attention?\n\n00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:44.494\nWell, studies show\n\n00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:47.694\nthat even when we're really\ntrying to pay attention to something --\n\n00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:49.294\nlike maybe this talk --\n\n00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:50.534\nat some point,\n\n00:00:50.558 --> 00:00:52.894\nabout half of us\nwill drift off into a daydream,\n\n00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.998\nor have this urge\nto check our Twitter feed.\n\n00:00:56.318 --> 00:00:57.838\nSo what's going on here?\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.414\nIt turns out that we're fighting one\nof the most evolutionarily-conserved\n\n00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:05.294\nlearning processes\ncurrently known in science,\n\n00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:06.534\none that's conserved\n\n00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:08.998\nback to the most basic\nnervous systems known to man.\n\n00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:11.454\nThis reward-based learning process\n\n00:01:11.478 --> 00:01:13.654\nis called positive\nand negative reinforcement,\n\n00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:15.238\nand basically goes like this.\n\n00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:17.854\nWe see some food that looks good,\n\n00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.574\nour brain says, \"Calories! ...

for her,\n\n00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:14.918\nthat's why she joined our program.\n\n00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:20.174\nWhat she discovered just by being\ncuriously aware when she smoked\n\n00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:23.334\nwas that smoking tastes like shit.\n\n00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:25.038\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:30.333\nNow, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.\n\n00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:33.453\nShe moved from knowing in her head\nthat smoking was bad for her\n\n00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:35.934\nto knowing it in her bones,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.254\nand the spell of smoking was broken.\n\n00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.638\nShe started to become\ndisenchanted with her behavior.\n\n00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:45.014\nNow, the prefrontal cortex,\n\n00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:48.574\nthat youngest part of our brain\nfrom an evolutionary perspective,\n\n00:04:48.598 --> 00:04:52.654\nit understands on an intellectual level\nthat we shouldn't smoke.\n\n00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:56.494\nAnd it tries its hardest\nto help us change our behavior,\n\n00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:57.854\nto help us stop smoking,\n\n00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:01.998\nto help us stop eating that second,\nthat third, that fourth cookie.\n\n00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:04.414\nWe call this cognitive control.\n\n00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:07.238\nWe're using cognition\nto control our behavior.\n\n00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:09.134\nUnfortunately,\n\n00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:11.094\nthis is also the first part of our brain\n\n00:05:11.118 --> 00:05:13.134\nthat goes offline\nwhen we get stressed out,\n\n00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:14.414\nwhich isn't that helpful.\n\n00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:16.915\nNow, we can all relate to this\nin our own experience.\n\n00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.094\nWe're much more likely to do things\nlike yell at our spouse or kids\n\n00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:21.734\nwhen we're stressed out or tired,\n\n00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:24.094\neven though we know\nit's not going to be helpful.\n\n00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:25.638\nWe just can't help ourselves.\n\n00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:29.254\nWhen the prefrontal cortex goes offline,\n\n00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:31.494\nwe fall back into our old habits,\n\n00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:34.374\nwhich is why this disenchantment\nis so important.\n\n00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:36.054\nSeeing what we get from our habits\n\n00:05:36.078 --> 00:05:38.254\nhelps us understand them\nat a deeper level --\n\n00:05:38.278 --> 00:05:39.534\nto know it in our bones\n\n00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:41.814\nso we don't have to force\nourselves to hold back\n\n00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:43.574\nor restrain ourselves from behavior.\n\n00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:46.374\nWe're just less interested\nin doing it in the first place.\n\n00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:48.934\nAnd this is what mindfulness is all about:\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.638\nSeeing really clearly what we get\nwhen we get caught up in our behaviors,\n\n00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.094\nbecoming disenchanted on a visceral level\n\n00:05:57.118 --> 00:06:00.238\nand from this disenchanted stance,\nnaturally letting go.\n\n00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:04.374\nThis isn't to say that, poof,\nmagically we quit smoking.\n\n00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:07.014\nBut over time, as we learn\nto see more and more clearly\n\n00:06:07.038 --> 00:06:08.374\nthe results of our actions,\n\n00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:11.038\nwe let go of old habits and form new ones.\n\n00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:13.414\nThe paradox here\n\n00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:16.254\nis that mindfulness is just\nabout being really interested\n\n00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:17.694\nin getting close and personal\n\n00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:20.294\nwith what's actually happening\nin our bodies and minds\n\n00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:21.934\nfrom moment to moment.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.254\nThis willingness\nto turn toward our experience\n\n00:06:24.278 --> 00:06:27.958\nrather than trying to make unpleasant\ncravings go away as quickly as possible.\n\n00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:31.294\nAnd this willingness\nto turn toward our experience\n\n00:06:31.318 --> 00:06:33.174\nis supported by curiosity,\n\n00:06:33.198 --> 00:06:34.934\nwhich is naturally rewarding.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.694\nWhat does curiosity feel like?\n\n00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:37.918\nIt feels good.\n\n00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.304\nAnd what happens when we get curious?\n\n00:06:41.328 --> 00:06:44.774\nWe start to notice that cravings\nare simply made up of body sensations --\n\n00:06:44.798 --> 00:06:47.054\noh, there's tightness, there's tension,\n\n00:06:47.078 --> 00:06:48.734\nthere's restlessness --\n\n00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:51.198\nand that these body\nsensations come and go.\n\n00:06:51.838 --> 00:06:54.814\nThese are bite-size pieces of experiences\n\n00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:56.854\nthat we can manage from moment to moment\n\n00:06:56.878 --> 00:07:01.014\nrather than getting clobbered\nby this huge, scary craving\n\n00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:02.414\nthat we choke on.\n\n00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:04.934\nIn other words, when we get curious,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.694\nwe step out of our old,\nfear-based, reactive habit patterns,\n\n00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:11.934\nand we step into being.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.854\nWe become this inner scientist\n\n00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:18.094\nwhere we're eagerly awaiting\nthat next data point.\n\n00:07:18.118 --> 00:07:22.654\nNow, this might sound\ntoo simplistic to affect behavior.\n\n00:07:22.678 --> 00:07:25.134\nBut in one study,\nwe found that mindfulness training\n\n00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:29.054\nwas twice as good as gold standard therapy\nat helping people quit smoking.\n\n00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:30.518\nSo it actually works.\n\n00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:34.574\nAnd when we studied\nthe brains of experienced meditators,\n\n00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:38.414\nwe found that parts of a neural network\nof self-referential processing\n\n00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:40.014\ncalled the default mode network\n\n00:07:40.038 --> 00:07:41.254\nwere at play.\n\n00:07:41.278 --> 00:07:44.214\nNow, one current hypothesis\nis that a region of this network,\n\n00:07:44.238 --> 00:07:46.454\ncalled the posterior cingulate cortex,\n\n00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:49.214\nis activated not necessarily\nby craving itself\n\n00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:51.854\nbut when we get caught up in it,\nwhen we get sucked in,\n\n00:07:51.878 --> 00:07:53.574\nand it takes us for a ride.\n\n00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.694\nIn contrast, when we let go --\n\n00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:57.094\nstep out of the process\n\n00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:59.614\njust by being curiously aware\nof what's happening --\n\n00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:01.758\nthis same brain region quiets down.\n\n00:08:03.278 --> 00:08:07.374\nNow we're testing app and online-based\nmindfulness training programs\n\n00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:10.534\nthat target these core mechanisms\n\n00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:15.054\nand, ironically, use the same technology\nthat's driving us to distraction\n\n00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.614\nto help us step out\nof our unhealthy habit patterns\n\n00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:21.654\nof smoking, of stress eating\nand other addictive behaviors.\n\n00:08:21.678 --> 00:08:24.254\nNow, remember that bit\nabout context-dependent memory?\n\n00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:27.174\nWe can deliver these tools\nto peoples' fingertips\n\n00:08:27.198 --> 00:08:29.454\nin the contexts that matter most.\n\n00:08:29.478 --> 00:08:30.694\nSo we can help them\n\n00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:33.694\ntap into their inherent capacity\nto be curiously aware\n\n00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:37.638\nright when that urge to smoke\nor stress eat or whatever arises.\n\n00:08:38.598 --> 00:08:40.414\nSo if you don't smoke or stress eat,\n\n00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:44.093\nmaybe the next time you feel this urge\nto check your email when you're bored,\n\n00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:46.357\nor you're trying to distract\nyourself from work,\n\n00:08:46.381 --> 00:08:50.180\nor maybe to compulsively respond\nto that text message when you're driving,\n\n00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:54.894\nsee if you can tap into\nthis natural capacity,\n\n00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:56.174\njust be curiously aware\n\n00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:59.134\nof what's happening in your body\nand mind in that moment.\n\n00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:00.614\nIt will just be another chance\n\n00:09:00.638 --> 00:09:04.294\nto perpetuate one of our endless\nand exhaustive habit loops ...\n\n00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:05.558\nor step out of it.\n\n00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:08.934\nInstead of see text message,\ncompulsively text back,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.694\nfeel a little bit better --\n\n00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:12.174\nnotice the urge,\n\n00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:13.654\nget curious,\n\n00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.614\nfeel the joy of letting go\n\n00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.838\nand repeat.\n\n00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:18.614\nThank you.\n\n00:09:18.638 --> 00:09:20.998\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How we'll fight the next deadly virus", "duration": "577", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/pardis_sabeti_how_we_ll_fight_the_next_deadly_virus", "transcript": "You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria. But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus. Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola. It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal. But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning \u2014 these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines \u2014 by singing. They gather together, and they show their joy. They show their spirit. And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together; we're bonded through a shared humanity.And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change. And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea. This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. And it was frightening, frightening for us all. We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone. We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding. We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.And unfortunately, that day came. On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone. This was an exceptional work that was done. They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on. It could've stopped something. But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months. With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks. And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case, but as a tidal wave.We had to work with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases \u2014 all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing. From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously. The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did. We sent it to Boston, where my team works. And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus. This is the blueprint \u2014 the genome of a virus is the blueprint. We all have one. It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful. We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human. Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing. We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating. And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally \u2014 that's what drives it. And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing.But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data. That's the way the status quo works.Well, that was not going to work at this point, right? We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help. So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web. We just released it to the whole world and said, \"Help us.\" And help came.Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released. Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community. We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that. Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage. Everybody wants to play a part. The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all. And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, \"Let's do this. Let's work together, and let's make this happen.\"But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do. And so many opportunities get missed when that happens. So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world. And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy. And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health-care workers in the field.But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful, to validate it. So we were waiting for more data to release that. and the data has still not come. We are still waiting, tweaking away, in silos rather than working together. And this just \u2014 we can't accept that. Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that. It's our lives on the line. And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah. These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately.See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division. When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives. But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same. We're all in this fight together. Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours. And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy.A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word \"Kenema,\" the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, is named after the Mende word for \"clear like a river, translucent and open to the public gaze.\" That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together. And we have to do that. We all have to demand that of ourselves and others \u2014 to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together. Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others. And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there. It could be something that's transmitted through the air. It could even be disseminated intentionally. And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses. But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy.So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always. And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2425, "subtitle":

00:01:05.028\nThey gather together,\nand they show their joy.\n\n00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:06.574\nThey show their spirit.\n\n00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:07.757\nAnd over the years,\n\n00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:10.894\nfrom year after year as I've visited them\nand they've visited me,\n\n00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:12.911\nI get to gather with them and I sing\n\n00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:15.109\nand we write and we love it,\n\n00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.676\nbecause it reminds us that we're not\njust there to pursue science together;\n\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.017\nwe're bonded through a shared humanity.\n\n00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:25.867\nAnd that of course, as you can imagine,\nbecomes extremely important,\n\n00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.664\neven essential, as things begin to change.\n\n00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:33.477\nAnd that changed a great deal\nin March of 2014,\n\n00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.847\nwhen the Ebola outbreak\nwas declared in Guinea.\n\n00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:38.516\nThis is the first outbreak in West Africa,\n\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.982\nnear the border\nof Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\n00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:44.554\nAnd it was frightening,\nfrightening for us all.\n\n00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:46.490\nWe had actually suspected for some time\n\n00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:49.156\nthat Lassa and Ebola were more\nwidespread than thought,\n\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.489\nand we thought it could\none day come to Kenema.\n\n00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.264\nAnd so members of my team\nimmediately went out\n\n00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:56.685\nand joined Dr. Humarr Khan\nand his team there,\n\n00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.386\nand we set up diagnostics to be able\nto have sensitive molecular tests\n\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.563\nto pick up Ebola if it came\nacross the border\n\n00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:03.850\nand into Sierra Leone.\n\n00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.870\nWe'd already set up this kind\nof capacity for Lassa virus,\n\n00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.051\nwe knew how to do it,\n\n00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:09.505\nthe team is outstanding.\n\n00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.766\nWe just had to give them\nthe tools and place to survey for Ebola.\n\n00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:14.926\nAnd unfortunately, that day came.\n\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.931\nOn May 23, 2014, a woman checked\ninto the maternity ward at the hospital,\n\n00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:23.681\nand the team ran\nthose important molecular tests\n\n00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:27.540\nand they identified the first\nconfirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.\n\n00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:30.114\nThis was an exceptional\nwork that was done.\n\n00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:32.398\nThey were able to diagnose\nthe case immediately,\n\n00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.735\nto safely treat the patient\n\n00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.777\nand to begin to do contact tracing\nto follow what was going on.\n\n00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:39.773\nIt could've stopped something.\n\n00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:42.644\nBut by the time that day came,\n\n00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:45.026\nthe outbreak had already\nbeen breeding for months.\n\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.690\nWith hundreds of cases, it had already\neclipsed all previous outbreaks.\n\n00:02:48.714 --> 00:02:52.358\nAnd it came into Sierra Leone\nnot as that singular case,\n\n00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:53.674\nbut as a tidal wave.\n\n00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:56.353\nWe had to work\nwith the international community,\n\n00:02:56.377 --> 00:03:00.083\nwith the Ministry of Health, with Kenema,\nto begin to deal with the cases,\n\n00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:02.178\nas the next week brought 31,\n\n00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:05.876\nthen 92, then 147 cases --\nall coming to Kenema,\n\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.201\none of the only places in Sierra Leone\nthat could deal with this.\n\n00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:12.967\nAnd we worked around the clock\ntrying to do everything we could,\n\n00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.952\ntrying to help the individuals,\ntrying to get attention,\n\n00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:17.923\nbut we also did one other simple thing.\n\n00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:22.291\nFrom that specimen that we take\nfrom a patient's blood to detect Ebola,\n\n00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:24.370\nwe can discard it, obviously.\n\n00:03:24.394 --> 00:03:28.010\nThe other thing we can do is, actually,\nput in a chemical and deactivate it,\n\n00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:30.764\nso just place it into a box\nand ship it across the ocean,\n\n00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:31.939\nand that's what we did.\n\n00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.059\nWe sent it to Boston, where my team works.\n\n00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:38.519\nAnd we also worked around the clock\ndoing shift work, day after day,\n\n00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:42.412\nand we quickly generated 99 genomes\nof the Ebola virus.\n\n00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:45.493\nThis is the blueprint -- the genome\nof a virus is the blueprint.\n\n00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:46.676\nWe all have one.\n\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.645\nIt says everything that makes up us,\n\n00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.578\nand it tells us so much information.\n\n00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:53.779\nThe results of this kind of work\nare simple and they're powerful.\n\n00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:56.824\nWe could actually take\nthese 99 different viruses,\n\n00:03:56.848 --> 00:03:58.295\nlook at them and compare them,\n\n00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.165\nand we could see, actually,\ncompared to three genomes\n\n00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.025\nthat had been previously\npublished from Guinea,\n\n00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.760\nwe could show that the outbreak\nemerged in Guinea months before,\n\n00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:09.626\nonce into the human population,\n\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.322\nand from there had been transmitting\nfrom human to human.\n\n00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:13.890\nNow, that's incredibly important\n\n00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:16.282\nwhen you're trying to figure out\nhow to intervene,\n\n00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:18.372\nbut the important thing\nis contact tracing.\n\n00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:21.798\nWe also could see that as the virus\nwas moving between humans,\n\n00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:23.079\nit was mutating.\n\n00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:25.254\nAnd each of those mutations\nare so important,\n\n00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:27.598\nbecause the diagnostics, the vaccines,\n\n00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:29.107\nthe therapies that we're using,\n\n00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:32.489\nare all based on that genome\nsequence, fundamentally --\n\n00:04:32.513 --> 00:04:33.734\nthat's what drives it.\n\n00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:36.640\nAnd so global health experts\nwould need to respond,\n\n00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:37.861\nwould have to develop,\n\n00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:40.438\nto recalibrate everything\nthat they were doing.\n\n00:04:41.037 --> 00:04:44.218\nBut the way that science works,\nthe position I was in at that point\n\n00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.393\nis, I had the data,\n\n00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.053\nand I could have worked\nin a silo for many, many months,\n\n00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:50.276\nanalyzed the data carefully, slowly,\n\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.760\nsubmitted the paper for publication,\ngone through a few back-and-forths,\n\n00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:56.913\nand then finally when the paper came out,\nmight release that data.\n\n00:04:56.937 --> 00:04:59.141\nThat's the way the status quo works.\n\n00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.736\nWell, that was not going to work\nat this point, right?\n\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.368\nWe had friends on the front lines\n\n00:05:03.392 --> 00:05:06.646\nand to us it was just obvious\nthat what we needed is help,\n\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.826\nlots of help.\n\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.247\nSo the first thing we did is,\n\n00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:11.956\nas soon as the sequences\ncame off the machines,\n\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.409\nwe published it to the web.\n\n00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:16.269\nWe just released it to the whole world\nand said, \"Help us.\"\n\n00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:17.628\nAnd help came.\n\n00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:18.814\nBefore we knew it,\n\n00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:21.174\nwe were being contacted\nfrom people all over,\n\n00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:23.642\nsurprised to see the data\nout there and released.\n\n00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:25.918\nSome of the greatest\nviral trackers in the world\n\n00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:28.021\nwere suddenly part of our community.\n\n00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.375\nWe were working together\nin this virtual way,\n\n00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.380\nsharing, regular calls, communications,\n\n00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:36.155\ntrying to follow the virus\nminute by minute,\n\n00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:38.400\nto see ways that we could stop it.\n\n00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:42.743\nAnd there are so many ways\nthat we can form communities like that.\n\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.465\nEverybody, particularly when the outbreak\nstarted to expand globally,\n\n00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:51.079\nwas reaching out to learn,\nto participate, to engage.\n\n00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:53.340\nEverybody wants to play a part.\n\n00:05:53.364 --> 00:05:56.144\nThe amount of human capacity\nout there is just amazing,\n\n00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:57.891\nand the Internet connects us all.\n\n00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:01.166\nAnd could you imagine that instead\nof being frightened of each other,\n\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.047\nthat we all just said, \"Let's do this.\n\n00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.594\nLet's work together,\nand let's make this happen.\"\n\n00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:08.360\nBut the problem is that the data\nthat all of us are using,\n\n00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:12.421\nGoogling on the web, is just too limited\nto do what we need to do.\n\n00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:15.096\nAnd so many opportunities\nget missed when that happens.\n\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.601\nSo in the early part\nof the epidemic from Kenema,\n\n00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.367\nwe'd had 106 clinical records\nfrom patients,\n\n00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:23.225\nand we once again made that\npublicly available to the world.\n\n00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.919\nAnd in our own lab, we could show\nthat you could take those 106 records,\n\n00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:30.561\nwe could train computers to predict\nthe prognosis for Ebola patients\n\n00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:32.362\nto near 100 percent accuracy.\n\n00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:34.483\nAnd we made an app\nthat could release that,\n\n00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:37.277\nto make that available\nto health-care workers in the field.\n\n00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:40.560\nBut 106 is just not enough\nto make it powerful,\n\n00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:41.735\nto validate it.\n\n00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.413\nSo we were waiting for more data\nto release that.\n\n00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.481\nand the data has

My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion. I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.(Applause)I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport. By the way, all that is through Special Olympics. Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments?The world does not see all people like me as champions. Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away. There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population. People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter. That's the word \"retard\" or \"retarded\" used in a derogatory manner. They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case. I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all.Did you know the World Games happened this year? I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA. There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies, and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN. Did you even know that happened?What do you think of when you see someone like me? I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals.Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching. For those of you who aren't familiar, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities. Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics. We offer high-quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions. This movement has changed my life and those of so many others. And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability. Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old. The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustrated. For a while, I did not play any sports, didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad.There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society. No one thought they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society. In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities. Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer.Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities. But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over.(Applause)Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, not confident and didn't have many friends. When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging, supportive, and let me be myself without being judged. Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games.(Applause)I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories. Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity.Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs. Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without. Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport. Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health. Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care.At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team. The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time.(Applause)The change in them was amazing. They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them. And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands \u2014 sounds that we take for granted. Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport. Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field. This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive.Then there's the r-word, proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people. People use it as a casual term or an insult. It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet. People don't think it's insulting, but it is. As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult, \"Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you walk away with your heart unchanged.\"(Applause)This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition. So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, deadlifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squat \u2014(Applause)setting huge new records for Special Olympics. Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland \u2014 not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters. Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance.Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that. This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from 165 countries around the world. Far from being hidden away, we were cheered and celebrated. Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves. Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.(Applause)Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.(Applause)I am no longer hidden, bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk.(Applause)The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still farther to go. So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their ability. The next time someone uses the r-word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hurts. I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.(Applause)I would like to leave you with one final thought. Nelson Mandela said, \"Sports has the power to change the world.\" Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and get to feel like and be champions.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2426, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.358 -->

00:07:41.454\nthe Nigerian basketball team went to\nthe World Games Healthy Athlete screening,\n\n00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:43.814\nwhere seven of 10 members\n\n00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.334\nwere given

Let's fix it", "duration": "844", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dambisa_moyo_economic_growth_has_stalled_let_s_fix_it", "transcript": "Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.Of course there are other challenges \u2014 health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism. However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity. In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25? In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation. And yet today, the largest emerging economies \u2014 countries with at least 50 million people \u2014 continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark. Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.Economic growth matters. With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards. Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual. If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition. There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. You worry about the overpopulation of the planet. And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources \u2014 arable land, potable water, energy and minerals. You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment. And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world. And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism. And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly. And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors. And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad. When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum. And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States. This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality \u2014 the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today? Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer \u2014 a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants. And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts. Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. But nevertheless, this framework \u2014 this two-stage framework \u2014 is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge. First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth. For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies. Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China. But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction. Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector.Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships. More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological. In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work.Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times. What do you say to those who react that way?DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion. There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards. And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources. Do you see that happening?DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid. But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes. And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.BG: The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism \u2014 with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues. Is that what you're suggesting?DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded. I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to. And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism \u2014 to the extent that it is free \u2014 free market capitalism as its economic stance. The second largest economy is China. It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model. These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient.I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.BG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris. If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?DM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded. As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now \u2014 in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm \u2014 and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want. Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries. Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&D. And so they have to come to the table as well. But in essence, it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets.BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.

00:00:33.974\nHowever,\n\n00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:38.574\nto the extent that we can actually\nsolve the economic growth challenge,\n\n00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:39.934\nit will take us a long way\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.558\nto solving the challenges\nthat I've just elucidated.\n\n00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:45.014\nMore importantly,\n\n00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:49.534\nunless and until we solve economic growth\n\n00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:53.574\nand create sustainable,\nlong-term economic growth,\n\n00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:56.014\nwe'll be unable to address\n\n00:00:56.038 --> 00:01:01.374\nthe seemingly intractable challenges\nthat continue to pervade the globe today,\n\n00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:05.798\nwhether it's health care,\neducation or economic development.\n\n00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:08.838\nThe fundamental question is this:\n\n00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:12.094\nHow are we going to create economic growth\n\n00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:16.694\nin advanced and developed economies\nlike the United States and across Europe\n\n00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:18.774\nat a time when they continue to struggle\n\n00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:21.598\nto create economic growth\nafter the financial crisis?\n\n00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.214\nThey continue to underperform\n\n00:01:25.238 --> 00:01:29.358\nand to see an erosion in the three\nkey drivers of economic growth:\n\n00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:33.318\ncapital, labor and productivity.\n\n00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:35.534\nIn particular,\n\n00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:40.494\nthese developed economies\ncontinue to see debts and deficits,\n\n00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:45.374\nthe decline and erosion\nof both the quality and quantity of labor\n\n00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:47.678\nand they also see productivity stalling.\n\n00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:50.254\nIn a similar vein,\n\n00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:53.694\nhow are we going to create\neconomic growth in the emerging markets,\n\n00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:56.974\nwhere 90 percent\nof the world's population lives\n\n00:01:56.998 --> 00:01:58.534\nand where, on average,\n\n00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:02.078\n70 percent of the population\nis under the age of 25?\n\n00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:04.054\nIn these countries,\n\n00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:08.254\nit is essential that they grow\nat a minimum of seven percent a year\n\n00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:10.374\nin order to put a dent in poverty\n\n00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:13.598\nand to double per capita incomes\nin one generation.\n\n00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:16.534\nAnd yet today,\n\n00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:18.654\nthe largest emerging economies --\n\n00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:21.374\ncountries with at least\n50 million people --\n\n00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:24.878\ncontinue to struggle to reach\nthat seven percent magic mark.\n\n00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:26.934\nWorse than that,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.574\ncountries like India, Russia,\nSouth Africa, Brazil and even China\n\n00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:34.094\nare falling below\nthat seven percent number\n\n00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:36.958\nand, in many cases, actually regressing.\n\n00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.678\nEconomic growth matters.\n\n00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:41.854\nWith economic growth,\n\n00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:46.054\ncountries and societies\nenter into a virtuous cycle\n\n00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:50.678\nof upward mobility, opportunity\nand improved living standards.\n\n00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:55.014\nWithout growth,\ncountries contract and atrophy,\n\n00:02:55.038 --> 00:02:58.254\nnot just in the annals\nof economic statistics\n\n00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.798\nbut also in the meaning of life\nand how lives are lived.\n\n00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:06.278\nEconomic growth matters\npowerfully for the individual.\n\n00:03:07.078 --> 00:03:08.694\nIf growth wanes,\n\n00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:10.734\nthe risk to human progress\n\n00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:15.174\nand the risk of political\nand social instability rises,\n\n00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:19.758\nand societies become dimmer,\ncoarser and smaller.\n\n00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:22.254\nThe context matters.\n\n00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:23.894\nAnd countries in emerging markets\n\n00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:27.758\ndo not need to grow at the same\nrates as developed countries.\n\n00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:33.638\nNow, I know some of you in this room\nfind this to be a risky proposition.\n\n00:03:34.638 --> 00:03:36.494\nThere are some people here\n\n00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:39.054\nwho will turn around\nand be quite disillusioned\n\n00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:40.854\nby what's happened around the world\n\n00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:43.478\nand basically ascribe that\nto economic growth.\n\n00:03:44.198 --> 00:03:47.694\nYou worry about the\noverpopulation of the planet.\n\n00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:50.614\nAnd looking at the UN's\nrecent statistics and projections\n\n00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:53.334\nthat the world will have\n11 billion people on the planet\n\n00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.934\nbefore it plateaus in 2100,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.774\nyou're concerned about what that does\nto natural resources --\n\n00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:03.918\narable land, potable water,\nenergy and minerals.\n\n00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:08.078\nYou are also concerned about\nthe degradation of the environment.\n\n00:04:08.718 --> 00:04:11.854\nAnd you worry about how man,\n\n00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.494\nembodied in the corporate globalist,\n\n00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:17.558\nhas become greedy and corrupt.\n\n00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:21.894\nBut I'm here to tell you today\nthat economic growth\n\n00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:25.294\nhas been the backbone\nof changes in living standards\n\n00:04:25.318 --> 00:04:27.278\nof millions of people around the world.\n\n00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:29.734\nAnd more importantly,\n\n00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:34.238\nit's not just economic growth\nthat has been driven by capitalism.\n\n00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:39.694\nThe definition of capitalism,\nvery simply put,\n\n00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:41.774\nis that the factors of production,\n\n00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:45.174\nsuch as trade and industry,\ncapital and labor,\n\n00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:49.118\nare left in the hands\nof the private sector and not the state.\n\n00:04:49.638 --> 00:04:52.374\nIt's really essential here\nthat we understand\n\n00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:57.414\nthat fundamentally the critique\nis not for economic growth per se\n\n00:04:57.438 --> 00:04:59.494\nbut what has happened to capitalism.\n\n00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:03.534\nAnd to the extent that we need to create\neconomic growth over the long term,\n\n00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:08.238\nwe're going to have to pursue it\nwith a better form of economic stance.\n\n00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:12.174\nEconomic growth needs capitalism,\n\n00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:13.878\nbut it needs it to work properly.\n\n00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.094\nAnd as I mentioned a moment ago,\n\n00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:23.078\nthe core of the capitalist system\nhas been defined by private actors.\n\n00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:27.734\nAnd even this, however,\nis a very simplistic dichotomy.\n\n00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:30.678\nCapitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.\n\n00:05:31.078 --> 00:05:33.734\nWhen in practical experience,\n\n00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:36.214\ncapitalism is much more of a spectrum.\n\n00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:38.494\nAnd we have countries such as China,\n\n00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:40.934\nwhich have practiced\nmore state capitalism,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.054\nand we have countries\nlike the Unites States\n\n00:05:43.078 --> 00:05:44.678\nwhich are more market capitalist.\n\n00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:48.254\nOur efforts to critique\nthe capitalist system, however,\n\n00:05:48.278 --> 00:05:51.494\nhave tended to focus\non countries like China\n\n00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.918\nthat are in fact\nnot blatantly market capitalism.\n\n00:05:55.558 --> 00:05:59.214\nHowever, there is\na real reason and real concern\n\n00:05:59.238 --> 00:06:03.894\nfor us to now focus our attentions\non purer forms of capitalism,\n\n00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:06.638\nparticularly those embodied\nby the United States.\n\n00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:09.014\nThis is really important\n\n00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:11.494\nbecause this type of capitalism\n\n00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:14.774\nhas increasingly\nbeen afforded the critique\n\n00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:17.214\nthat it is now fostering corruption\n\n00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:18.614\nand, worse still,\n\n00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:21.278\nit's increasing income inequality --\n\n00:06:22.078 --> 00:06:26.798\nthe idea that the few are benefiting\nat the expense of the many.\n\n00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:31.934\nThe two really critical questions\nthat we need to address\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.654\nis how can we fix capitalism\n\n00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:37.454\nso that it can help create economic growth\n\n00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:40.838\nbut at the same time\ncan help to address social ills.\n\n00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:45.054\nIn order to think about that framing,\nwe have to ask ourselves,\n\n00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:46.798\nhow does capitalism work today?\n\n00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:49.318\nVery simplistically,\n\n00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:55.694\ncapitalism is set on the basis\nof an individual utility maximizer --\n\n00:06:55.718 --> 00:07:00.014\na selfish individual\nwho goes after what he or she wants.\n\n00:07:00.038 --> 00:07:03.174\nAnd only after they've\nmaximized their utility\n\n00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:05.694\ndo they then decide it's important\n\n00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:08.798\nto provide support\nto other social contracts.\n\n00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:12.734\nOf course, in this system\ngovernments do tax,\n\n00:07:12.758 --> 00:07:16.494\nand they use part of their revenues\nto fund social programs,\n\n00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:19.374\nrecognizing that government's role\nis not just regulation\n\n00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:22.678\nbut also to be arbiter of social goods.\n\n00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:24.574\nBut nevertheless,\n\n00:07:24.598 --> 00:07:25.934\nthis framework --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.934\nthis two-stage framework --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.934\nis the basis from which we must now start\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.558\nto think about how we can\nimprove the capitalist model.\n\n00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:36.878\nI would argue that there are\ntwo sides to this challenge.\n\n00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:38.694\nFirst of all,\n\n00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:41.654\nwe can draw on the right-wing policies\n\n00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:43.534\nto see what could be beneficial for us\n\n00:07:43.558 --> 00:07:45.678\nto think about how\nwe can improve capitalism.\n\n00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:47.654\nIn particular,\n\n00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:49.414\nright-leaning policies\n\n00:07:49.438 --> 00:07:52.894\nhave tended to focus on things\nlike conditional transfers,\n\n00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:55.934\nwhere we pay and reward people\nfor doing the things\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.414\nthat we actually think\ncan help enhance economic growth.\n\n00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.654\nFor example,\n\n00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:02.294\nsending children to school,\n\n00:08:02.318 --> 00:08:04.534\nparents could earn money for that,\n\n00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:07.934\nor getting their children\ninoculated or immunized,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.838\nparents could get paid for doing that.\n\n00:08:10.318 --> 00:08:12.414\nNow, quite apart from the debate\n\n00:08:12.438 --> 00:08:14.734\non whether or not\nwe should be paying people\n\n00:08:14.758 --> 00:08:17.454\nto do what we think they should do anyway,\n\n00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:20.654\nthe fact of the matter\nis that pay for performance\n\n00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:23.094\nhas actually yielded some positive results\n\n00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:24.814\nin places like Mexico,\n\n00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.094\nin Brazil\n\n00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:28.718\nand also in pilot programs in New York.\n\n00:08:29.478 --> 00:08:30.974\nBut there are also benefits\n\n00:08:30.998 --> 00:08:35.358\nand significant changes underway\non left-leaning policies.\n\n00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:40.094\nArguments that government should\nexpand its role and responsibility\n\n00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:42.334\nso that it's not so narrowly defined\n\n00:08:42.358 --> 00:08:44.853\nand that government should be\nmuch more of an arbiter\n\n00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:46.254\nof the factors of production\n\n00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:48.678\nhave become commonplace\nwith the success of China.\n\n00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:51.654\nBut also we've started to have debates\n\n00:08:51.678 --> 00:08:53.934\nabout how the role of the private sector\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.534\nshould move away\nfrom just being a profit motive\n\n00:08:56.558 --> 00:09:00.054\nand really be more engaged\nin the delivery of social programs.\n\n00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:03.294\nThings like the corporate\nsocial responsibility programs,\n\n00:09:03.318 --> 00:09:05.294\nalbeit small in scale,\n\n00:09:05.318 --> 00:09:07.198\nare moving in that right direction.\n\n00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:13.134\nOf course, left-leaning policies\nhave also tended to blur the lines\n\n00:09:13.158 --> 00:09:15.838\nbetween government,\nNGOs and private sector.\n\n00:09:16.758 --> 00:09:20.734\nTwo very good examples of this\nare the 19th-century United States,\n\n00:09:20.758 --> 00:09:22.374\nwhen the infrastructure rollout\n\n00:09:22.398 --> 00:09:25.494\nwas really about\npublic-private partnerships.\n\n00:09:25.518 --> 00:09:26.934\nMore recently, of course,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.574\nthe advent of the Internet\nhas also proven to the world\n\n00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:34.438\nthat public and private can work together\nfor the betterment of society.\n\n00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:39.254\nMy fundamental message to you is this:\n\n00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:44.694\nWe cannot continue to try and solve\nthe world economic growth challenges\n\n00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:48.878\nby being dogmatic\nand being unnecessarily ideological.\n\n00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:53.574\nIn order to create sustainable,\nlong-term economic growth\n\n00:09:53.598 --> 00:09:57.894\nand solve the challenges and social ills\nthat continue to plague the world today,\n\n00:09:57.918 --> 00:10:00.214\nwe're going to have to be\nmore broad-minded\n\n00:10:00.238 --> 00:10:01.758\nabout what might work.\n\n00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:03.814\nUltimately,\n\n00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:07.974\nwe have to recognize\nthat ideology is the enemy of growth.\n\n00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:09.214\nThank you.\n\n00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:11.478\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:15.118 --> 00:10:18.014\nBruno Giussani: I want to ask\na couple of questions, Dambisa,\n\n00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:20.174\nbecause one could react\nto your last sentence\n\n00:10:20.198 --> 00:10:22.014\nby saying growth is also an ideology,\n\n00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.374\nit's possibly the dominant\nideology of our times.\n\n00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:26.494\nWhat do you say\nto those who react that way?\n\n00:10:26.518 --> 00:10:28.974\nDM: Well, I think that that's\ncompletely legitimate,\n\n00:10:28.998 --> 00:10:31.574\nand I think that we're already\nhaving that discussion.\n\n00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:33.814\nThere's a lot of work\ngoing on around happiness\n\n00:10:33.838 --> 00:10:37.334\nand other metrics being used\nfor measuring people's success\n\n00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:39.174\nand improvements in living standards.\n\n00:10:39.198 --> 00:10:41.254\nAnd so I think that we should be open\n\n00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:44.254\nto what could deliver improvements\nin people's living standards\n\n00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:46.534\nand continue to reduce\npoverty around the world.\n\n00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:49.374\nBG: So you're basically pleading\nfor rehabilitating growth,\n\n00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:50.974\nbut the only way for that happen\n\n00:10:50.998 --> 00:10:53.334\nwithout compromising\nthe capacity of the earth,\n\n00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:54.894\nto take us on a long journey,\n\n00:10:54.918 --> 00:10:56.574\nis for

00:11:05.174\nDM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic\nabout human ability and ingenuity.\n\n00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:07.374\nI think if we start to constrain ourselves\n\n00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:10.454\nusing the finite, scarce\nand depleting resources\n\n00:11:10.478 --> 00:11:11.734\nthat we know today,\n\n00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.094\nwe could get quite negative\n\n00:11:13.118 --> 00:11:15.334\nand quite concerned\nabout the way the world is.\n\n00:11:15.358 --> 00:11:17.654\nHowever, we've seen the Club of Rome,\n\n00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:20.094\nwe've seen previous claims\n\n00:11:20.118 --> 00:11:22.454\nthat the world would be\nrunning out of resources,\n\n00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:25.054\nand it's not to argue\nthat those things are not valid.\n\n00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:27.734\nBut I think, with ingenuity\nwe could see desalination,\n\n00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:29.694\nI think we could reinvest in energy,\n\n00:11:29.718 --> 00:11:31.854\nso that we can actually\nget better outcomes.\n\n00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:33.094\nAnd so in that sense,\n\n00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:35.494\nI'm much more optimistic\nabout what humans can do.\n\n00:11:35.518 -->

00:11:58.574\nDM: I'm suggesting\nwe have to be open-minded.\n\n00:11:58.598 --> 00:12:00.814\nI think it is absolutely the case\n\n00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:03.294\nthat traditional models of economic growth\n\n00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:05.734\nare not working the way\nwe would like them to.\n\n00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.654\nAnd I think it's no accident\n\n00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:10.974\nthat today the

capitalism,\nwhich is a completely different model.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.694\nThese two countries,\ncompletely different political models\n\n00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.694\nand completely

00:12:39.814\nI think those are the debates\nwe should have,\n\n00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:41.974\nbecause it's not clear at all\n\n00:12:41.998 --> 00:12:43.814\nwhat model we should be adopting,\n\n00:12:43.838 --> 00:12:46.174\nand I think there needs to be\nmuch more discourse\n\n00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:49.614\nand much more humility\nabout what we know and what we don't know.\n\n00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:53.014\nBG: One last question.\nThe COP21 is going on in Paris.\n\n00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.534\nIf you could send a tweet\n\n00:12:54.558 --> 00:12:57.854\nto all the heads of state\nand heads of delegations there,\n\n00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.254\nwhat would you say?\n\n00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.934\nDM: Again, I would be very much\nabout being open-minded.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.174\nAs you're aware,\n\n00:13:03.198 --> 00:13:05.294\nthe issues around\nthe environmental concerns\n\n00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.294\nhave been on the

00:13:15.494\npartly because there is not\na fundamental agreement,\n\n00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:16.774\nin fact there's a schism\n\n00:13:16.798 --> 00:13:19.534\nbetween what the developed\ncountries believe and want\n\n00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:21.894\nand what emerging market countries want.\n\n00:13:21.918 --> 00:13:25.134\nEmerging market countries need\nto continue to create economic growth\n\n00:13:25.158 --> 00:13:28.574\nso that we don't have political\nuncertainty in the those countries.\n\n00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:30.734\nDeveloped countries recognize\n\n00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:33.014\nthat they have a real,\nimportant responsibility\n\n00:13:33.038 --> 00:13:35.854\nnot only just to manage\ntheir CO2 emissions\n\n00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:39.054\nand some of the degradation\nthat they're contributing to the world,\n\n00:13:39.078 --> 00:13:40.854\nbut also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.\n\n00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:43.134\nAnd so they have to come\nto the table as well.\n\n00:13:43.158 --> 00:13:45.614\nBut in essence, it cannot be a situation\n\n00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:49.774\nwhere we start ascribing policies\nto the emerging markets\n\n00:13:49.798 -->

will change work as we know it", "duration": "562", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sean_follmer_shape_shifting_tech_will_change_work_as_we_know_it", "transcript": "We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand.However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture.But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford.So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical.So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical.We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect.Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do \"research\" \u2014(Laughter)and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know \u2014 research.(Laughter)But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices.So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well.But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone.(Laughter)And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode.So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere \u2014 they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks?So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals.So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2410, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.322\nWe've evolved with

it,\nbut it's dynamic, it's physical,\n\n00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:07.543\nand you can also interact directly.\n\n00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.305\nOr you can look at different views,\n\n00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.146\nsuch as population or traffic information,\n\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.732\nbut it's made physical.\n\n00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:18.764\nWe also believe that these dynamic\nshape displays can really change\n\n00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:21.748\nthe ways that we remotely\ncollaborate with people.\n\n00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:24.075\nSo when we're working together in person,\n\n00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.757\nI'm not only looking at your face\n\n00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.819\nbut I'm also gesturing\nand manipulating objects,\n\n00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:32.633\nand that's really hard to do\nwhen you're using tools like Skype.\n\n00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:36.849\nAnd so using inFORM,\nyou can reach out from the screen\n\n00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:38.985\nand manipulate things at a distance.\n\n00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.184\nSo we used the pins of the display\nto represent people's hands,\n\n00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:46.714\nallowing them to actually touch\nand manipulate objects at a distance.\n\n00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:54.751\nAnd you can also manipulate\nand collaborate on 3D data sets as well,\n\n00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:58.444\nso you can gesture around them\nas well as manipulate them.\n\n00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:02.858\nAnd that allows people to collaborate\non these new types of 3D information\n\n00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:06.493\nin a richer way than might\nbe possible with traditional tools.\n\n00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:10.581\nAnd so you can also\nbring in existing objects,\n\n00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.819\nand those will be captured on one side\nand transmitted to the other.\n\n00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:16.629\nOr you can have an object that's linked\nbetween two places,\n\n00:04:16.653 --> 00:04:18.737\nso as I move a ball on one side,\n\n00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.688\nthe ball moves on the other as well.\n\n00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:25.339\nAnd so we do this by capturing\nthe remote user\n\n00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:28.168\nusing a depth-sensing camera\nlike a Microsoft Kinect.\n\n00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:31.733\nNow, you might be wondering\nhow does this all work,\n\n00:04:31.757 --> 00:04:35.408\nand essentially, what it is,\nis 900 linear actuators\n\n00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:37.718\nthat are connected to these\nmechanical linkages\n\n00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:41.488\nthat allow motion down here\nto be propagated in these pins above.\n\n00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:45.079\nSo it's not that complex\ncompared to what's going on at CERN,\n\n00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:47.429\nbut it did take a long time\nfor us to build it.\n\n00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.708\nAnd so we started with a single motor,\n\n00:04:49.732 --> 00:04:51.147\na single linear actuator,\n\n00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.937\nand then we had to design\na custom circuit board to control them.\n\n00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.013\nAnd then we had to make a lot of them.\n\n00:04:57.037 --> 00:05:00.651\nAnd so the problem with having\n900 of something\n\n00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.795\nis that you have to do\nevery step 900 times.\n\n00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.176\nAnd so that meant that we had\na lot of work to do.\n\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.932\nSo we sort of set up\na mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab\n\n00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:13.668\nand brought undergrads in and convinced\nthem to do \"research\" --\n\n00:05:13.692 --> 00:05:14.706\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.748\nand had late nights\nwatching movies, eating pizza\n\n00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:19.600\nand screwing in thousands of screws.\n\n00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:20.822\nYou know -- research.\n\n00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:22.393\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.735\nBut anyway, I think that we were\nreally excited by the things\n\n00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.455\nthat inFORM allowed us to do.\n\n00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.679\nIncreasingly, we're using mobile devices,\nand we interact on the go.\n\n00:05:31.703 --> 00:05:34.382\nBut mobile devices, just like computers,\n\n00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:36.717\nare used for so many\ndifferent applications.\n\n00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:38.734\nSo you use them to talk on the phone,\n\n00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:41.914\nto surf the web, to play games,\nto take pictures\n\n00:05:41.938 --> 00:05:43.647\nor even a million different things.\n\n00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:46.655\nBut again, they have the same\nstatic physical form\n\n00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.797\nfor each of these applications.\n\n00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.184\nAnd so we wanted to know how can we take\nsome of the same interactions\n\n00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:53.891\nthat we developed for inFORM\n\n00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:55.803\nand bring them to mobile devices.\n\n00:05:56.385 --> 00:06:00.032\nSo at Stanford, we created\nthis haptic edge display,\n\n00:06:00.056 --> 00:06:03.233\nwhich is a mobile device\nwith an array of linear actuators\n\n00:06:03.257 --> 00:06:04.604\nthat can change shape,\n\n00:06:04.628 --> 00:06:08.525\nso you can feel in your hand\nwhere you are as you're reading a book.\n\n00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:12.753\nOr you can feel in your pocket\nnew types of tactile sensations\n\n00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:14.579\nthat are richer than the vibration.\n\n00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:17.838\nOr buttons can emerge from the side\nthat allow you to interact\n\n00:06:17.862 --> 00:06:19.570\nwhere you want them to be.\n\n00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:24.689\nOr you can play games\nand have actual buttons.\n\n00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:27.260\nAnd so we were able to do this\n\n00:06:27.284 --> 00:06:32.038\nby embedding 40 small, tiny\nlinear actuators inside the device,\n\n00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:34.117\nand that allow you not only to touch them\n\n00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:36.045\nbut also back-drive them as well.\n\n00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:41.047\nBut we've also looked at other ways\nto create more complex shape change.\n\n00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:44.463\nSo we've used pneumatic actuation\nto create a morphing device\n\n00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:48.352\nwhere you can go from something\nthat looks a lot like a phone ...\n\n00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:50.606\nto a wristband on the go.\n\n00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:54.517\nAnd so together with Ken Nakagaki\nat the Media Lab,\n\n00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:57.095\nwe created this new\nhigh-resolution version\n\n00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:03.069\nthat uses an array of servomotors\nto change from interactive wristband\n\n00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:06.221\nto a touch-input device\n\n00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:07.490\nto a phone.\n\n00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:09.172\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.234\nAnd we're also interested\nin looking at ways\n\n00:07:12.258 --> 00:07:14.885\nthat users can actually\ndeform the interfaces\n\n00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:17.797\nto shape them into the devices\nthat they want to use.\n\n00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:20.229\nSo you can make something\nlike a game controller,\n\n00:07:20.253 --> 00:07:22.883\nand then the system will understand\nwhat shape it's in\n\n00:07:22.907 --> 00:07:24.526\nand change to that mode.\n\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.582\nSo, where does this point?\n\n00:07:27.606 --> 00:07:29.534\nHow do we move forward from here?\n\n00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:32.153\nI think, really, where we are today\n\n00:07:32.177 --> 00:07:34.931\nis in this new age\nof the Internet of Things,\n\n00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.746\nwhere we have computers everywhere --\n\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.888\nthey're in our pockets,\nthey're in our walls,\n\n00:07:38.912 --> 00:07:42.478\nthey're in almost every device\nthat you'll buy in the next five years.\n\n00:07:42.502 --> 00:07:45.383\nBut what if we stopped\nthinking about devices\n\n00:07:45.407 --> 00:07:47.801\nand think instead about environments?\n\n00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:50.337\nAnd so how can we have smart furniture\n\n00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:53.677\nor smart rooms or smart environments\n\n00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:56.793\nor cities that can adapt to us physically,\n\n00:07:56.817 --> 00:08:01.048\nand allow us to do new ways\nof collaborating with people\n\n00:08:01.072 --> 00:08:03.310\nand doing new types of tasks?\n\n00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:06.718\nSo for the Milan Design Week,\nwe created TRANSFORM,\n\n00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:10.566\nwhich is an interactive table-scale\nversion of these shape displays,\n\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.773\nwhich can move physical objects\non the surface; for example,\n\n00:08:13.797 --> 00:08:16.054\nreminding you to take your keys.\n\n00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:20.560\nBut it can also transform\nto fit different ways of interacting.\n\n00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:21.901\nSo if you want to work,\n\n00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:24.917\nthen it can change to sort of\nset up your work system.\n\n00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:26.892\nAnd so as you bring a device over,\n\n00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:29.654\nit creates all the affordances you need\n\n00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:34.478\nand brings other objects\nto help you accomplish those goals.\n\n00:08:37.097 --> 00:08:38.658\nSo, in conclusion,\n\n00:08:38.682 --> 00:08:42.681\nI really think that we need to think\nabout a new, fundamentally different way\n\n00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:44.863\nof interacting with computers.\n\n00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:48.463\nWe need computers\nthat can physically adapt to us\n\n00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:51.088\nand adapt to the ways\nthat we want to use them\n\n00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:55.659\nand really harness the rich dexterity\nthat we have of our hands,\n\n00:08:55.683 --> 00:08:59.954\nand our ability to think spatially\nabout information by making it physical.\n\n00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:04.617\nBut looking forward, I think we need\nto go beyond this, beyond devices,\n\n00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:08.034\nto really think about new ways\nthat we can bring people together,\n\n00:09:08.058 --> 00:09:11.076\nand bring our information into the world,\n\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.053\nand think about smart environments\nthat can adapt to us physically.\n\n00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:16.641\nSo with that, I will leave you.\n\n00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:17.816\nThank you very much.\n\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.432\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I'm discovering the secrets of ancient texts", "duration": "727", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/gregory_heyworth_how_i_m_discovering_the_secrets_of_ancient_texts", "transcript": "On January 26, 2013, a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine, including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction. Unknown in the West, this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent, the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all. The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event, called the burning of the manuscripts \"a crime against world cultural heritage.\" And he was right \u2014 or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.In fact, just before, African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn. Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako, the capital of Mali, moldering in the high humidity. What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy, this time by climate.But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world, are not the only places, or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy. Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that, at the barest minimum, there are 60,000 manuscripts pre-1500 that are illegible because of water damage, fading, mold and chemical reagents. The real number is likely double that, and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps.What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works? Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past. Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature, history, philosophy, music \u2014 or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities, building new bridges between people and culture. These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts, into a textual scientist.What an unsatisfying word \"reader\" is. For me, it conjures up images of passivity, of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel. How much better to be a participant in the past, an adventurer in an undiscovered country, searching for the hidden text. As an academic, I was a mere reader. I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years \u2014 Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch \u2014 and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight. What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past, a discoverer of literature, an Indiana Jones without the whip \u2014 or, actually, with the whip.(Laughter) And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career. At the time, I was working on \"The Chess of Love,\" the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited. And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost. For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me.And so I did what many people do. I went online, and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a 13th-century palimpsest. A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.And so, out of the blue, I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project, Professor Roger Easton, with a plan and a plea. And to my surprise, he actually wrote back. With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab, And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic.So how does multispectral imaging actually work? Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate: that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there. The same is true with invisible writing. Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared, and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs, and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript. Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz. There are about five of these in the world. And once we capture these images, we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them, using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA.The results can be spectacular. You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are slowly gelatinizing. Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls. You may not be aware, however, of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged, which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world. The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin, and it dates from the first half of the fourth century. This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine, and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea, when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon. This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged, and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church. In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus, which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis. Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in 250 years.Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however, is only part of the solution. The technology is expensive and very rare, and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric. That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions. That's why I founded the Lazarus Project, a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever. Over the past five years, our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts, included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English, the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh, and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts. More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object, the story of how, when and by whom a text was created, and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote. Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand, which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress. Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten. The word overwritten was \"citizens.\" Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was. \"Subjects.\" There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map, which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library. This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located. The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large, nearly seven-foot map, made the world look like a giant desert. Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is, of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented. The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light. Ultraviolet did very little for it. Multispectral gave us everything. In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body. In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke. Like starlight, which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past, so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation. Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind, the na\u00efvet\u00e9s, the uncensored thoughts, the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real, that make history closer to us.What about the future? There's so much of the past, and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever. That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call \"textual science.\" Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar \u2014 the ability to read old languages and old handwriting, the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them \u2014 with new techniques like imaging science, the chemistry of inks and pigments, computer-aided optical character recognition.Last year, a student in my class, a freshman, with a background in Latin and Greek, was image-processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome. As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text. Everyone gathered around, and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander. This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud.

city of Timbuktu\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\non the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.\n\n00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:26.214\nThere, they set fire to a medieval library\nof 30,000 manuscripts\n\n00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:29.014\nwritten in Arabic\nand several African languages\n\n00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:34.774\nand ranging in subject from astronomy\nto geography, history to medicine,\n\n00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:36.494\nincluding one book which records\n\n00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:40.438\nperhaps the first treatment\nfor male erectile dysfunction.\n\n00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:43.014\nUnknown in the West,\n\n00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:46.454\nthis was the collected wisdom\nof an entire continent,\n\n00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:50.558\nthe voice of Africa at a time when Africa\nwas thought not to have a voice at all.\n\n00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:53.934\nThe mayor of Bamako,\nwho witnessed the event,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.894\ncalled the burning of the manuscripts\n\n00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:58.158\n\"a crime against world cultural heritage.\"\n\n00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:00.374\nAnd he was right --\n\n00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:03.838\nor he would have been, if it weren't\nfor the fact that he was also lying.\n\n00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:07.254\nIn fact, just before,\n\n00:01:07.278 --> 00:01:11.414\nAfrican scholars had collected\na random assortment of old books\n\n00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.934\nand left them out\nfor the terrorists to burn.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.894\nToday, the collection\nlies hidden in Bamako,\n\n00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:18.294\nthe capital of Mali,\n\n00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:20.414\nmoldering in the high humidity.\n\n00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:22.294\nWhat was rescued by ruse\n\n00:01:22.318 --> 00:01:24.054\nis now once again in jeopardy,\n\n00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:25.318\nthis time by climate.\n\n00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:28.574\nBut Africa, and the far-flung\ncorners of the world,\n\n00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:30.894\nare not the only places,\nor even the main places\n\n00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:35.214\nin which manuscripts that could change\nthe history of world culture\n\n00:01:35.238 --> 00:01:36.758\nare in jeopardy.\n\n00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:42.614\nSeveral years ago, I conducted\na survey of European research libraries\n\n00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:44.894\nand discovered that,\nat the barest minimum,\n\n00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:48.134\nthere are 60,000 manuscripts\n\n00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:49.774\npre-1500\n\n00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.734\nthat are illegible\nbecause of water

doesn't even count\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.574\nRenaissance manuscripts\nand modern manuscripts\n\n00:02:04.598 --> 00:02:07.718\nand cultural heritage\nobjects such as maps.\n\n00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:12.374\nWhat if there were a technology\n\n00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:17.734\nthat could recover\nthese lost and unknown works?\n\n00:02:17.758 --> 00:02:22.174\nImagine worldwide\nhow a trove of hundreds of thousands\n\n00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:25.134\nof previously unknown texts\n\n00:02:25.158 --> 00:02:28.198\ncould radically transform\nour knowledge of the past.\n\n00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:34.254\nImagine what unknown classics\nwe would discover\n\n00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:37.614\nwhich would rewrite the canons\nof literature, history,\n\n00:02:37.638 --> 00:02:39.078\nphilosophy, music --\n\n00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.334\nor, more provocatively, that could\nrewrite our cultural identities,\n\n00:02:43.358 --> 00:02:46.718\nbuilding new bridges\nbetween people and culture.\n\n00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:50.014\nThese are the questions\nthat transformed me\n\n00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:52.854\nfrom a medieval scholar,\na reader of texts,\n\n00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:54.678\ninto a textual scientist.\n\n00:02:56.078 --> 00:02:58.374\nWhat an unsatisfying word \"reader\" is.\n\n00:02:58.398 --> 00:03:00.974\nFor me, it conjures up\nimages of passivity,\n\n00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:03.414\nof someone sitting idly in an armchair\n\n00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:05.734\nwaiting for knowledge to come to him\n\n00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:07.454\nin a neat little parcel.\n\n00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:10.494\nHow much better to be\na participant in the past,\n\n00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.694\nan adventurer in an undiscovered country,\n\n00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:16.118\nsearching for the hidden text.\n\n00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:19.758\nAs an academic, I was a mere reader.\n\n00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:22.934\nI read and taught the same classics\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.094\nthat people had been reading\nand teaching for hundreds of years --\n\n00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:29.134\nVirgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --\n\n00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.494\nand with every scholarly article\nthat I published\n\n00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:34.718\nI added to human knowledge\nin ever-diminishing slivers of insight.\n\n00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:38.294\nWhat I wanted to be\n\n00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.414\nwas an archaeologist of the past,\n\n00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:42.014\na discoverer of literature,\n\n00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:43.934\nan Indiana Jones without the whip --\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.454\nor, actually, with the whip.\n\n00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:46.694\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:46.718 --> 00:03:50.414\nAnd I wanted it not just for myself\nbut I wanted it for my students as well.\n\n00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:54.334\nAnd so six years ago,\nI changed the direction of my career.\n\n00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:57.374\nAt the time, I was working\non \"The Chess of Love,\"\n\n00:03:57.398 --> 00:04:00.254\nthe last important long poem\nof the European Middle Ages\n\n00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:01.894\nnever to have been edited.\n\n00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:04.934\nAnd it wasn't edited because\nit existed in only one manuscript\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.214\nwhich was so badly damaged\nduring the firebombing of Dresden\n\n00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:09.454\nin World War II\n\n00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.358\nthat generations of scholars\nhad pronounced it lost.\n\n00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.814\nFor five years, I had been working\nwith an ultraviolet lamp\n\n00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:18.734\ntrying to recover traces of the writing\n\n00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.174\nand I'd gone about as far\nas technology at the time\n\n00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:22.574\ncould actually take me.\n\n00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:24.694\nAnd so I did what many people do.\n\n00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:26.734\nI went online,\n\n00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:28.494\nand there I learned about\n\n00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:33.094\nhow multispectral imaging had been used\nto recover two lost treatises\n\n00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:36.014\nof the famed Greek\nmathematician Archimedes\n\n00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:37.574\nfrom a 13th-century palimpsest.\n\n00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:40.878\nA palimpsest is a manuscript\nwhich has been erased and overwritten.\n\n00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:43.414\nAnd so, out of the blue,\n\n00:04:43.438 --> 00:04:46.494\nI decided to write\nto the lead imaging scientist\n\n00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.734\non the Archimedes palimpsest project,\n\n00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:50.254\nProfessor Roger Easton,\n\n00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:52.094\nwith a plan and a plea.\n\n00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:54.158\nAnd to my surprise,\nhe actually wrote back.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.614\nWith his help, I was able\nto win a grant from the US government\n\n00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:03.654\nto build a transportable,\nmultispectral imaging lab,\n\n00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:08.494\nAnd with this lab, I transformed\nwhat was a charred and faded mess\n\n00:05:08.518 --> 00:05:10.518\ninto a new medieval classic.\n\n00:05:11.318 --> 00:05:14.094\nSo how does multispectral\nimaging actually work?\n\n00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:16.574\nWell, the idea\nbehind multispectral imaging\n\n00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:20.894\nis something that anyone who is familiar\nwith infrared night vision goggles\n\n00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:22.294\nwill immediately appreciate:\n\n00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:24.814\nthat what we can see\nin the visible spectrum of light\n\n00:05:24.838 --> 00:05:27.158\nis only a tiny fraction\nof what's actually there.\n\n00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:29.878\nThe same is true with invisible writing.\n\n00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:35.414\nOur system uses 12 wavelengths of light\n\n00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:37.934\nbetween the ultraviolet and the infrared,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.014\nand these are shown down\nonto the manuscript from above\n\n00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:42.654\nfrom banks of LEDs,\n\n00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:44.534\nand another multispectral light source\n\n00:05:44.558 --> 00:05:47.511\nwhich comes up through\nthe individual leaves of the manuscript.\n\n00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:52.054\nUp to 35 images per sequence\nper leaf are imaged this way\n\n00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:54.698\nusing a high-powered digital camera\nequipped with a lens\n\n00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:56.694\nwhich is made out of quartz.\n\n00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:58.814\nThere are about five\nof these in the world.\n\n00:05:58.838 --> 00:06:00.654\nAnd once we capture these images,\n\n00:06:00.678 --> 00:06:02.734\nwe feed them through\nstatistical algorithms\n\n00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.254\nto further enhance and clarify them,\n\n00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:08.654\nusing software which was originally\ndesigned for satellite images\n\n00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:12.054\nand used by people\nlike geospatial scientists\n\n00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:13.278\nand the CIA.\n\n00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:16.294\nThe results can be spectacular.\n\n00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:18.494\nYou may already have heard\nof what's been done\n\n00:06:18.518 --> 00:06:19.894\nfor the Dead Sea Scrolls,\n\n00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:21.478\nwhich are slowly gelatinizing.\n\n00:06:22.438 --> 00:06:26.094\nUsing infrared, we've been able\nto read even the darkest corners\n\n00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:27.838\nof the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\n00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:30.294\nYou may not be aware, however,\n\n00:06:30.318 --> 00:06:33.054\nof other Biblical texts\nthat are in jeopardy.\n\n00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:36.494\nHere, for example,\nis a leaf from a manuscript\n\n00:06:36.518 --> 00:06:38.294\nthat we imaged,\n\n00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:42.198\nwhich is perhaps the most valuable\nChristian Bible in the world.\n\n00:06:42.838 --> 00:06:48.614\nThe Codex Vercellensis is the oldest\ntranslation of the Gospels into Latin,\n\n00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:51.238\nand it dates from the first half\nof the fourth century.\n\n00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:54.774\nThis is the closest we can come\n\n00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:58.734\nto the Bible at the time\nof the foundation of Christendom\n\n00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:00.374\nunder Emperor Constantine,\n\n00:07:00.398 --> 00:07:02.934\nand at the time also\nof the Council of Nicaea,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.454\nwhen the basic creed of Christianity\nwas being agreed upon.\n\n00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:09.734\nThis manuscript, unfortunately,\nhas been very badly damaged,\n\n00:07:09.758 --> 00:07:11.974\nand it's damaged because for centuries\n\n00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.454\nit had been used and handled\n\n00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:17.174\nin swearing in ceremonies in the church.\n\n00:07:17.198 --> 00:07:21.854\nIn fact, that purple splotch\nthat you see in the upper left hand corner\n\n00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:26.174\nis Aspergillus, which is a fungus\n\n00:07:26.198 --> 00:07:29.734\nwhich originates in the unwashed hands\n\n00:07:29.758 --> 00:07:31.758\nof a person with tuberculosis.\n\n00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:35.654\nOur imaging has enabled me\nto make the first transcription\n\n00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:38.278\nof this manuscript in 250 years.\n\n00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:43.214\nHaving a lab that can travel\nto collections where it's needed, however,\n\n00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:44.718\nis only part of the solution.\n\n00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:48.294\nThe technology is expensive and very rare,\n\n00:07:48.318 --> 00:07:51.534\nand the imaging and image\nprocessing skills are esoteric.\n\n00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:53.254\nThat means that mounting recoveries\n\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:58.174\nis beyond the reach of most researchers\nand all but the wealthiest institutions.\n\n00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:00.974\nThat's why I founded the Lazarus Project,\n\n00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:02.654\na not-for-profit initiative\n\n00:08:02.678 --> 00:08:06.654\nto bring multispectral imaging\nto individual researchers\n\n00:08:06.678 --> 00:08:10.518\nand smaller institutions\nat little or no cost whatsoever.\n\n00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:13.134\nOver the past five years,\n\n00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:17.014\nour team of imaging scientists,\nscholars and students\n\n00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.214\nhas travelled to seven different countries\n\n00:08:19.238 --> 00:08:23.094\nand have recovered some of the world's\nmost valuable damaged manuscripts,\n\n00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:26.118\nincluded the Vercelli Book,\nwhich is the oldest book of English,\n\n00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:28.758\nthe Black Book of Carmarthen,\nthe oldest book of Welsh,\n\n00:08:28.782 --> 00:08:32.254\nand some of the most valuable\nearliest Gospels\n\n00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.158\nlocated in what is now\nthe former Soviet Georgia.\n\n00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.518\nSo, spectral imaging\ncan recover lost texts.\n\n00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:45.414\nMore subtly, though, it can recover\na second story behind every object,\n\n00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:50.134\nthe story of how, when\nand by whom a text was created,\n\n00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:53.558\nand, sometimes, what the author\nwas thinking at the time he wrote.\n\n00:08:54.558 --> 00:08:57.654\nTake, for example, a draft\nof the Declaration of Independence\n\n00:08:57.678 --> 00:09:00.094\nwritten in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,\n\n00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:02.547\nwhich some colleagues of mine\nimaged a few years ago\n\n00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:03.891\nat the Library of Congress.\n\n00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:07.014\nCurators had noticed\nthat one word throughout\n\n00:09:07.038 --> 00:09:09.414\nhad been scratched out and overwritten.\n\n00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:11.518\nThe word overwritten was \"citizens.\"\n\n00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:14.798\nPerhaps you can guess\nwhat the word underneath was.\n\n00:09:15.918 --> 00:09:17.334\n\"Subjects.\"\n\n00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:20.174\nThere, ladies and gentlemen,\nis American democracy\n\n00:09:20.198 --> 00:09:22.278\nevolving under the hand\nof Thomas Jefferson.\n\n00:09:23.318 --> 00:09:27.174\nOr consider the 1491 Martellus Map,\n\n00:09:27.198 --> 00:09:29.534\nwhich we imaged\nat Yale's Beinecke Library.\n\n00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:32.014\nThis

It hasn't always been this way. In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height. In the last 150 years, in developed countries, on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller. And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is, but almost all of them involve nutrition, namely the increase of dairy and meat.In the last 50 years, global meat consumption has more than quadrupled, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons. Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs. In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption. And we know that globally, we are getting richer. And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population, from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050, which means that by 2050, we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein than what is available to humankind today. And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number, by the end of this century, at 11 billion, which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.This challenge is staggering \u2014 so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein. Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day. At the same time, our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support, meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace.WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years, our global marine life has been slashed in half. And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species, such as swordfish and bluefin tuna, over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries. But ultimately, all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant. It's unlikely, even with the best-managed fisheries, that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today.We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have. We need to alleviate the pressure on it. And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce, we might face total collapse. Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.So how do we fix this? What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years when there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources? We could all become vegan. Sounds like a great idea, but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not. And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path, failing to meet demands.The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage, which is due to that same growing, global population and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land. It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition. People are hungry, and we are running dangerously low on natural resources. For so, so many reasons, we need to change our global food production systems.We must do better and there is a solution. And that solution lies in aquaculture \u2014 the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans. As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said, \"We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters. That's what civilization is all about \u2014 farming instead of hunting.\" Fish is the last food that we hunt.And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, \"Life's too short for farmed fish,\" or, \"Wild-caught, of course!\" over fish that we know virtually nothing about? We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters. And if it was a large predatory species, it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday. We don't know. Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal.But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice. It's healthy, it prevents heart disease, it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega-3s, which is very different from almost any other type of meat. And aside from being healthy, it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.Think about it \u2014 most animal farming is pretty monotonous. Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig, and poultry \u2014 turkey, duck, chicken \u2014 pretty much sums it up. And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently. not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves, but that's beside that point.And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish. I know I sound fish-obsessed \u2014(Laughter)Let me explain: My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago. We were inspired by Sylvia Earle, who won the TED Prize in 2009. We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos. Amy was there as the TED Prize Director; me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen, love to dive, passion for the oceans.Mission Blue truly changed our lives. We fell in love, got married and we came away really inspired, thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation \u2014 something that was meant to last, that could make a real difference and something that we could do together.Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming. But a few months after we got off the boat, we got to a meeting at Conservation International, where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture, asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it, realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need.We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right.And to talk about stats \u2014 right now, the amount of fish consumed globally, wild catch and farmed combined, is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year. Every single fishing vessel combined, small and large, across the globe, together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood for human consumption.Aquaculture this year, for the first time in history, actually produces more than what we catch from the wild.But now this: Demand is going to go up. In the next 35 years, we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand, which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost, as what we catch globally out of our oceans. An enormous number.It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean. It needs to come from farming. And talk about farming \u2014 for farming you need resources. As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive, so does an animal. A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat. Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet. We just don't have enough feed or water.And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it. And fresh water \u2014 planet earth has a very limited supply. We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet.And now let's compare that with fish farming. You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed, and depending on species, even less. And why is that? Well, that's because fish, first of all, float. They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do. And most fish are cold-blooded \u2014 they don't need to heat themselves. Fish chills.(Laughter)And it needs very little water, which is counterintuitive, but as we say, it swims in it but it hardly drinks it. Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind, aside from insects.How much we've learned since. For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught for human consumption, there's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed, mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.This is madness. Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed. Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it. It's destroying our oceans. The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it. Recently, an article came out of Stanford saying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal, our oceans would be saved. Now think about that for a minute.Now, we know that the oceans have far more problems \u2014 they have pollution, there's acidification, coral reef destruction and so on. But it underlines the impact of our fisheries, and it underlines how interconnected everything is. Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation, climate change, food security and so on.In the search for alternatives, the industry, on a massive scale, has reverted to plant-based alternatives like soy, industrial chicken waste, blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on.And we understand where these choices come from, but this is not the right approach. It's not sustainable, it's not healthy. Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean? Of course not. If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes. Salmon is a carnivore, it has no way to digest soy.Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind. But it's had a really bad reputation. There's been excessive use of chemicals, there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations, ecosystem destruction and pollution, escaped fish breeding with wild populations, altering the overall genetic pool, and then of course, as just mentioned, the unsustainable feed ingredients.How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate, whatever it was. Once you know, you know. You can't go back. It's not fun. We really need a transparent food system that we can trust, that produces healthy food.But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better. We can now farm fish without any of these issues.I think of agriculture before the green revolution \u2014 we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution. New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural, with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae. Healthy for the people, healthy for the fish, healthy for the planet.Microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal \u2014 at scale.Insects are the \u2014 well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed. You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it. And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale. We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.I imagine, for example, a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming, where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish with little or no effluent, almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint. Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other \u2014 off of each other, mimicking nature. You need very little feed, very little footprint. I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.There's great technologies popping up all over the globe. From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore, to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry, so we can save on feed and create less pollution. Software systems that gather data across farms, so we can improve farm practices.There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe. And make no mistake \u2014 all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today. Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt. And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together \u2014 rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision.Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction. This industry is still young, much of its growth is still ahead. It's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think. It's possible.So we need to take pressure off the ocean. We want to eat good and healthy. And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life.We need to have a meal that we can trust, live long lives. And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe \u2014 this is for all of us. Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money. People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about. We're all the same.The day will come where people will realize \u2014 no, demand \u2014 farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy \u2014 and refuse anything less.You can help speed this up. Ask questions when you order seafood. Where does my fish come from? Who raised it, and what did it eat? Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available. And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing.So every time you order, ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you. And eventually, they will listen. And all of us will benefit.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2427, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.149\nSo I come from the tallest\npeople

push much harder\nfor more produce,\n\n00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.458\nwe might face total collapse.\n\n00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:51.827\nOur current systems are not going to feed\na growing global population.\n\n00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:54.087\nSo how do we fix this?\n\n00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:56.849\nWhat's the world going to look like\nin just 35 short years\n\n00:02:56.873 --> 00:03:00.472\nwhen there's 2.7 billion more of us\nsharing the same resources?\n\n00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:02.889\nWe could all become vegan.\n\n00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:04.666\nSounds like a great idea,\n\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.994\nbut it's not realistic\n\n00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.363\nand it's impossibly hard\nto mandate globally.\n\n00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:11.971\nPeople are eating animal protein\nwhether we like it or not.\n\n00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:14.354\nAnd suppose we fail to change our ways\n\n00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:16.504\nand continue on the current path,\n\n00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.362\nfailing to meet demands.\n\n00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:20.608\nThe World Health Organization\nrecently reported\n\n00:03:20.632 --> 00:03:24.794\nthat 800 million people are suffering\nfrom malnutrition and food shortage,\n\n00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:28.229\nwhich is due to that same\ngrowing, global population\n\n00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:32.275\nand the declining access to resources\nlike water, energy and land.\n\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.230\nIt takes very little imagination\n\n00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:40.204\nto picture a world of global unrest,\nriots and further malnutrition.\n\n00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:41.854\nPeople are hungry,\n\n00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:44.916\nand we are running dangerously low\non natural resources.\n\n00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:46.842\nFor so, so many reasons,\n\n00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:49.620\nwe need to change our global\nfood production systems.\n\n00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:51.637\nWe must do better\n\n00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:52.826\nand there is a solution.\n\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.435\nAnd that solution lies in aquaculture --\n\n00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.405\nthe farming of fish, plants like seaweed,\nshellfish and crustaceans.\n\n00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.248\nAs the great ocean hero\nJacques Cousteau once said,\n\n00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:05.146\n\"We must start using the ocean\nas farmers instead of hunters.\n\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.700\nThat's what civilization is all about --\nfarming instead of hunting.\"\n\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.788\nFish is the last food that we hunt.\n\n00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:15.640\nAnd why is it that we keep\nhearing phrases like,\n\n00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:17.347\n\"Life's too short for farmed fish,\"\n\n00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:18.959\nor, \"Wild-caught, of course!\"\n\n00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:21.332\nover fish that we know\nvirtually nothing about?\n\n00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:23.567\nWe don't know what it ate\nduring its lifetime,\n\n00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:25.783\nand we don't know what\npollution it encounters.\n\n00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:27.697\nAnd if it was a large predatory species,\n\n00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.560\nit might have gone through the coast\nof Fukushima yesterday.\n\n00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:31.928\nWe don't know.\n\n00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:33.295\nVery few people realize\n\n00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.961\nthe traceability in fisheries\nnever goes beyond the hunter\n\n00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.500\nthat caught the wild animal.\n\n00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:39.961\nBut let's back up for a second\n\n00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.572\nand talk about why fish\nis the best food choice.\n\n00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:43.747\nIt's healthy,\n\n00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.027\nit prevents heart disease,\n\n00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.494\nit provides key amino acids\n\n00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:49.271\nand key fatty acids like Omega-3s,\n\n00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:52.172\nwhich is very different from almost\nany other type of meat.\n\n00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:53.806\nAnd aside from being healthy,\n\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.427\nit's also a lot more exciting and diverse.\n\n00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:59.634\nThink about it -- most animal farming\nis pretty monotonous.\n\n00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:02.309\nCow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,\n\n00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:06.410\nand poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken --\npretty much sums it up.\n\n00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:11.249\nAnd then there's 500 species of fish\nbeing farmed currently.\n\n00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:14.201\nnot that Western supermarkets\nreflect that on their shelves,\n\n00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:15.622\nbut that's beside that point.\n\n00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:18.397\nAnd you can farm fish\nin a very healthy manner\n\n00:05:18.437 --> 00:05:21.437\nthat's good for us, good for the planet\nand good for the fish.\n\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.956\nI know I sound fish-obsessed --\n\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.106\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.281\nLet me explain:\n\n00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:30.464\nMy brilliant partner and wife,\nAmy Novograntz, and I got involved\n\n00:05:30.488 --> 00:05:32.439\nin aquaculture a couple of years ago.\n\n00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:34.735\nWe were inspired by Sylvia Earle,\n\n00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.055\nwho won the TED Prize in 2009.\n\n00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:40.213\nWe actually met on Mission Blue I\nin the Galapagos.\n\n00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:43.052\nAmy was there as the TED Prize Director;\n\n00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.266\nme, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands\nand concerned citizen,\n\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.663\nlove to dive, passion for the oceans.\n\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.584\nMission Blue truly changed our lives.\n\n00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:52.759\nWe fell in love,\n\n00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:54.259\ngot married\n\n00:05:54.283 --> 00:05:56.524\nand we came away really inspired,\n\n00:05:56.548 --> 00:05:59.757\nthinking we really want to do something\nabout ocean conservation --\n\n00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:01.516\nsomething that was meant to last,\n\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.096\nthat could make a real difference\n\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.746\nand something that we could do together.\n\n00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.989\nLittle did we expect that that would\nlead us to fish farming.\n\n00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.797\nBut a few months after\nwe got off the boat,\n\n00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.355\nwe got to a meeting\nat Conservation International,\n\n00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.406\nwhere the Director General of WorldFish\nwas talking about aquaculture,\n\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.176\nasking a room full of environmentalists\nto stop turning from it,\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.961\nrealize what was going on\n\n00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.406\nand to really get involved\n\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.542\nbecause aquaculture has the potential\n\n00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:32.652\nto be just what our oceans\nand populations need.\n\n00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:35.025\nWe were stunned when we heard the stats\n\n00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:37.585\nthat we didn't know more\nabout this industry already\n\n00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:40.516\nand excited about the chance\nto help get it right.\n\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.747\nAnd to talk about stats --\n\n00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.547\nright now, the amount of fish\nconsumed globally,\n\n00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.627\nwild catch and farmed combined,\n\n00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:49.983\nis twice the tonnage\nof the total amount of beef\n\n00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:51.880\nproduced on planet earth last year.\n\n00:06:52.397 --> 00:06:54.704\nEvery single fishing vessel combined,\n\n00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:56.659\nsmall and large, across the globe,\n\n00:06:56.683 --> 00:07:00.560\ntogether produce about 65 million tons\nof wild-caught seafood\n\n00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:01.981\nfor human consumption.\n\n00:07:02.581 --> 00:07:03.887\nAquaculture this year,\n\n00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:05.490\nfor the first time in history,\n\n00:07:05.514 --> 00:07:08.371\nactually produces more\nthan what we catch from the wild.\n\n00:07:08.832 --> 00:07:09.983\nBut now this:\n\n00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:11.361\nDemand is going to go up.\n\n00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:13.624\nIn the next 35 years,\n\n00:07:13.648 --> 00:07:18.643\nwe are going to need an additional\n85 million tons to meet demand,\n\n00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.262\nwhich is one-and-a-half times\nas much, almost,\n\n00:07:21.286 --> 00:07:23.845\nas what we catch globally\nout of our oceans.\n\n00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:26.424\nAn enormous number.\n\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.869\nIt's safe to assume that that's not\ngoing to come from the ocean.\n\n00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:31.562\nIt needs to come from farming.\n\n00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:33.436\nAnd talk about farming --\n\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.427\nfor farming you need resources.\n\n00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:39.200\nAs a human needs to eat\nto grow and stay alive,\n\n00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.697\nso does an animal.\n\n00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:43.616\nA cow needs to eat\neight to nine pounds of feed\n\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.091\nand drink almost 8,000 liters of water\n\n00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:47.995\nto create just one pound of meat.\n\n00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.536\nExperts agree that it's impossible\n\n00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.712\nto farm cows for every\ninhabitant on this planet.\n\n00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:56.474\nWe just don't have enough feed or water.\n\n00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:59.252\nAnd we can't keep cutting down\nrain forests for it.\n\n00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:02.785\nAnd fresh water -- planet earth\nhas a very limited supply.\n\n00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:04.920\nWe need something more efficient\n\n00:08:04.944 --> 00:08:07.825\nto keep humankind alive on this planet.\n\n00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:10.622\nAnd now let's compare\nthat with fish farming.\n\n00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:15.060\nYou can farm one pound of fish\nwith just one pound of feed,\n\n00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:17.416\nand depending on species, even less.\n\n00:08:17.803 --> 00:08:19.033\nAnd why is that?\n\n00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:22.826\nWell, that's because fish,\nfirst of all, float.\n\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.436\nThey don't need to stand around all day\nresisting gravity like we do.\n\n00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:28.518\nAnd most fish are cold-blooded --\n\n00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:30.222\nthey don't need to heat themselves.\n\n00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:31.414\nFish chills.\n\n00:08:31.438 --> 00:08:33.059\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:34.623\nAnd it needs very little water,\n\n00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:35.925\nwhich is counterintuitive,\n\n00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.336\nbut as we say,\n\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.754\nit swims in it but it hardly drinks it.\n\n00:08:39.778 --> 00:08:44.191\nFish are the most resource-efficient\nanimal protein available to humankind,\n\n00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:45.650\naside from insects.\n\n00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:48.869\nHow much we've learned since.\n\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.877\nFor example, on top of that\n65 million tons that's annually caught\n\n00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.511\nfor human consumption,\n\n00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:58.522\nthere's an additional 30 million tons\ncaught for animal feed,\n\n00:08:58.546 --> 00:09:02.087\nmostly sardines and anchovies\nfor the aquaculture industry\n\n00:09:02.111 --> 00:09:04.148\nthat's turned into fish meal and fish oil.\n\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.907\nThis is madness.\n\n00:09:06.506 --> 00:09:10.078\nSixty-five percent of these fisheries,\nglobally, are badly managed.\n\n00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:12.812\nSome of the worst issues\nof our time are connected to it.\n\n00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:14.134\nIt's destroying our oceans.\n\n00:09:14.158 --> 00:09:17.176\nThe worst slavery issues\nimaginable are connected to it.\n\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.470\nRecently, an article came out of Stanford\n\n00:09:20.494 --> 00:09:23.367\nsaying that if 50 percent\nof the world's aquaculture industry\n\n00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:24.693\nwould stop using fish meal,\n\n00:09:24.717 --> 00:09:26.367\nour oceans would be saved.\n\n00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:28.450\nNow think about that for a minute.\n\n00:09:28.474 --> 00:09:31.494\nNow, we know that the oceans\nhave far more problems --\n\n00:09:31.518 --> 00:09:34.303\nthey have pollution,\nthere's acidification,\n\n00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:35.910\ncoral reef destruction and so on.\n\n00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:38.471\nBut it underlines the impact\nof our fisheries,\n\n00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.070\nand it underlines how\ninterconnected everything is.\n\n00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:45.182\nFisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,\n\n00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:48.240\nclimate change, food security and so on.\n\n00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:50.294\nIn the search for alternatives,\n\n00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.373\nthe industry, on a massive scale,\n\n00:09:52.397 --> 00:09:54.560\nhas reverted to plant-based alternatives\n\n00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:57.437\nlike soy, industrial chicken waste,\n\n00:09:57.461 --> 00:09:59.303\nblood meal from slaughterhouses\n\n00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:00.582\nand so on.\n\n00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:03.070\nAnd we understand where\nthese choices come from,\n\n00:10:03.094 --> 00:10:05.223\nbut this is not the right approach.\n\n00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:06.502\nIt's not sustainable,\n\n00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:07.700\nit's not healthy.\n\n00:10:07.724 --> 00:10:10.387\nHave you ever seen a chicken\nat the bottom of the ocean?\n\n00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.762\nOf course not.\n\n00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:13.982\nIf you feed salmon soy with nothing else,\n\n00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:15.768\nit literally explodes.\n\n00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:17.573\nSalmon is a carnivore,\n\n00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:19.492\nit has no way to digest soy.\n\n00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:23.129\nNow, fish farming is by far\n\n00:10:23.153 --> 00:10:25.470\nthe best animal farming\navailable to humankind.\n\n00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:27.866\nBut it's had a really bad reputation.\n\n00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:30.510\nThere's been excessive use of chemicals,\n\n00:10:30.534 -->

plate,\n\n00:10:49.092 --> 00:10:50.297\nwhatever it was.\n\n00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.322\nOnce you know, you know.\n\n00:10:52.346 --> 00:10:53.552\nYou can't go back.\n\n00:10:53.576 --> 00:10:54.727\nIt's not fun.\n\n00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:57.940\nWe really need a transparent food\nsystem that we can trust,\n\n00:10:57.964 --> 00:10:59.638\nthat produces healthy food.\n\n00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:01.883\nBut the good news is\n\n00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:04.820\nthat decades of development and research\n\n00:11:04.844 --> 00:11:07.306\nhave led to a lot of new\ntechnologies and knowledge\n\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.142\nthat allow us to do a lot better.\n\n00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:11.812\nWe can now farm fish\nwithout any of these issues.\n\n00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:15.387\nI think of agriculture\nbefore the green revolution --\n\n00:11:15.411 --> 00:11:18.434\nwe are at aquaculture\nand the blue revolution.\n\n00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:21.012\nNew technologies means\n\n00:11:21.036 --> 00:11:24.604\nthat we can now produce a feed\nthat's perfectly natural,\n\n00:11:24.628 --> 00:11:25.812\nwith a minimal footprint\n\n00:11:25.836 --> 00:11:29.781\nthat consists of microbes, insects,\nseaweeds and micro-algae.\n\n00:11:30.647 --> 00:11:31.950\nHealthy for the people,\n\n00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:33.125\nhealthy for the fish,\n\n00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:34.470\nhealthy for the planet.\n\n00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:36.401\nMicrobes, for example,\n\n00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.274\ncan be a perfect alternative\nfor high-grade fish meal --\n\n00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.453\nat scale.\n\n00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:42.842\nInsects are the --\n\n00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:44.827\nwell, first of all, the perfect recycling\n\n00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:46.581\nbecause they're grown on food waste;\n\n00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:47.757\nbut second,\n\n00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:48.932\nthink of fly-fishing,\n\n00:11:48.956 --> 00:11:52.269\nand you know how logical\nit actually is to use it as fish feed.\n\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.693\nYou don't need large tracts of land for it\n\n00:11:54.717 --> 00:11:57.127\nand you don't need\nto cut down rain forests for it.\n\n00:11:57.828 --> 00:12:00.917\nAnd microbes and insects are actually\nnet water producers.\n\n00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:03.696\nThis revolution is starting as we speak,\n\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.197\nit just needs scale.\n\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.517\nWe can now farm far more\nspecies than ever before\n\n00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:13.178\nin controlled, natural conditions,\ncreating happy fish.\n\n00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:15.139\nI imagine, for example,\n\n00:12:15.163 --> 00:12:20.771\na closed system that's performing\nmore efficiently than insect farming,\n\n00:12:20.795 --> 00:12:24.039\nwhere you can produce\nhealthy, happy, delicious fish\n\n00:12:24.063 --> 00:12:25.435\nwith little or no effluent,\n\n00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.919\nalmost no energy and almost no water\n\n00:12:27.943 --> 00:12:30.252\nand a natural feed\nwith a minimal footprint.\n\n00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.269\nOr a system where you grow\nup to 10 species next to each other --\n\n00:12:34.293 --> 00:12:35.669\noff of each other,\n\n00:12:35.693 --> 00:12:37.133\nmimicking nature.\n\n00:12:37.876 --> 00:12:39.246\nYou need very little feed,\n\n00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.492\nvery little footprint.\n\n00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:44.417\nI think of seaweed growing\noff the effluent of fish, for example.\n\n00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:49.206\nThere's great technologies\npopping up all over the globe.\n\n00:12:49.532 --> 00:12:51.711\nFrom alternatives to battle disease\n\n00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:54.600\nso we don't need antibiotics\nand chemicals anymore,\n\n00:12:54.624 --> 00:12:58.280\nto automated feeders that feel\nwhen the fish are hungry,\n\n00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:01.595\nso we can save on feed\nand create less pollution.\n\n00:13:01.974 --> 00:13:04.577\nSoftware systems that gather\ndata across farms,\n\n00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:06.487\nso we can improve farm practices.\n\n00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:09.941\nThere's really cool stuff\nhappening all over the globe.\n\n00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:13.271\nAnd make no mistake --\nall of these things are possible\n\n00:13:13.295 --> 00:13:16.430\nat a cost that's competitive\nto what a farmer spends today.\n\n00:13:16.982 --> 00:13:20.929\nTomorrow, there will be no excuse\nfor anyone to not do the right thing.\n\n00:13:22.122 --> 00:13:24.381\nSo somebody needs to connect the dots\n\n00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:26.988\nand give these developments\na big kick in the butt.\n\n00:13:27.012 --> 00:13:30.029\nAnd that's what we've been working on\nthe last couple of years,\n\n00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:32.539\nand that's what we need\nto be working on together --\n\n00:13:33.007 --> 00:13:35.358\nrethinking everything from the ground up,\n\n00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.901\nwith a holistic view\nacross the value chain,\n\n00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:40.059\nconnecting all these things\nacross the globe,\n\n00:13:40.083 -->

this industry\n\n00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:50.500\nand to push it into\na sustainable direction.\n\n00:13:50.524 --> 00:13:51.946\nThis industry is still young,\n\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.662\nmuch of its growth is still ahead.\n\n00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.833\nIt's a big task, but not\nas far-fetched as you might think.\n\n00:13:56.857 --> 00:13:58.007\nIt's possible.\n\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.167\nSo we need to take pressure off the ocean.\n\n00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:02.738\nWe want to eat good and healthy.\n\n00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:04.834\nAnd if we eat an animal,\nit needs to be one\n\n00:14:04.858 --> 00:14:06.516\nthat had a happy and healthy life.\n\n00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.747\nWe need to have a meal that we can trust,\n\n00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:09.984\nlive long lives.\n\n00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:14.434\nAnd this is not just for people\nin San Francisco or Northern Europe --\n\n00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:16.304\nthis is for all of us.\n\n00:14:16.328 --> 00:14:17.988\nEven in the poorest countries,\n\n00:14:18.012 --> 00:14:19.522\nit's not just about money.\n\n00:14:19.546 --> 00:14:23.362\nPeople prefer something fresh\nand healthy that they can trust\n\n00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:27.178\nover something that comes from far away\nthat they know nothing about.\n\n00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:28.518\nWe're all the same.\n\n00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:31.376\nThe day will come\n\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.641\nwhere people will realize -- no, demand --\nfarmed fish on their plate\n\n00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:37.042\nthat's farmed well\nand that's farmed healthy --\n\n00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:39.416\nand refuse anything less.\n\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.809\nYou can help speed this up.\n\n00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:43.479\nAsk questions when you order seafood.\n\n00:14:43.503 --> 00:14:45.360\nWhere does my fish come from?\n\n00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.899\nWho raised it,\n\n00:14:46.923 --> 00:14:48.288\nand what did it eat?\n\n00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:52.625\nInformation about where your fish\ncomes from and how it was produced\n\n00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:54.791\nneeds to be much more readily available.\n\n00:14:55.621 --> 00:14:58.805\nAnd consumers need to put pressure\non the aquaculture industry\n\n00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:00.121\nto do the right thing.\n\n00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:02.654\nSo every time you order,\n\n00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:04.645\nask for detail\n\n00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:07.151\nand show that you really care\nabout what you eat\n\n00:15:07.175 --> 00:15:08.605\nand what's been given to you.\n\n00:15:08.957 --> 00:15:11.301\nAnd eventually, they will listen.\n\n00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:13.122\nAnd all of us will benefit.\n\n00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:14.684\nThank you.\n\n00:15:14.708 -->

"15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test. When I arrived at the clinic to be tested, I was handed a questionnaire. One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race: White, black, Asian, or Native American.I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question. Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds? In that case, I would answer with my social identity, and check the box for \"black.\" But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits? In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry, which is just as much European as African? And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman? After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons. Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes. Well, despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity, I was told, \"Don't worry about it, just put down however you identify yourself.\" So I check \"black,\" but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically.That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking: Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice. It shapes physicians' diagnoses, measurements, treatments, prescriptions, even the very definition of diseases. And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction. When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina, we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world. As a legal scholar, I've also studied how lawmakers, not biologists, have invented the legal definitions of races.And it's not just the view of social scientists. You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000? President Bill Clinton famously declared, \"I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms, human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9 percent the same.\" And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes.Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH, echoed President Clinton. \"I am happy that today, the only race we're talking about is the human race.\"Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine, and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution. But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. Doctors routinely interpret GFR, this important indicator of kidney function, by race. As you can see in this lab test, the exact same creatinine level, the concentration in the blood of the patient, automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African-American. Why?I've been told it's based on an assumption that African-Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races. But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder? Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them?Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut. It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level, genetic traits they just don't have time to look for. But race is a bad proxy. In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all. It's just a distraction. But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures. It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms, family illnesses, their history, their own illnesses they might have \u2014 all more evidence-based than the patient's race. Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being.Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race.Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes. Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain, exaggerate their pain, and are predisposed to drug addiction.The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine. It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients. A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics, but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients. The FDA then allowed the company, the drug company, to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African-American subjects. It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs. But think about the dangerous message it sent, that black people's bodies are so substandard, a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients.In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed. For one thing, black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people. One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted, \"Give me what the white people are taking!\"(Laughter)And if you find race-specific medicine surprising, wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era, a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery.Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War, and he was a well-known expert on what was then called \"Negro medicine.\" He promoted the racial concept of disease, that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently. Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons. He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites, forced labor was good for them. He wrote in a medical journal, \"It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control, and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom.\" To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people. Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled \"race\" so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race. It's a well-known function called \"correcting for race.\"The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients. Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health: lack of access to high-quality medical care; food deserts in poor neighborhoods; exposure to environmental toxins; high rates of incarceration; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.You see, race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference. Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences, but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health. Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race-specific pill. It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine. I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity. Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about, there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race. Would you imagine with me, just a moment: What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race? Suppose they rejected an 18th-century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity, that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races? What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor, doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor? What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism, not by genetic difference?Race medicine is bad medicine, it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity. It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. Thanks.

--> 00:02:02.654\nThat personal experience\nwith the use of race in genetic testing\n\n00:02:02.678 --> 00:02:04.254\ngot me thinking:\n\n00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:09.998\nWhere else in medicine is race used\nto make false biological predictions?\n\n00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:16.934\nWell, I found out that race runs deeply\nthroughout all of medical practice.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.973\nIt shapes physicians' diagnoses,\n\n00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:22.614\nmeasurements, treatments,\n\n00:02:22.638 --> 00:02:24.254\nprescriptions,\n\n00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.438\neven the very definition of diseases.\n\n00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:32.318\nAnd the more I found out,\nthe more disturbed I became.\n\n00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:36.774\nSociologists like me have long explained\n\n00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:39.694\nthat race is a social construction.\n\n00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:46.214\nWhen we identify people as black,\nwhite, Asian, Native American, Latina,\n\n00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:48.974\nwe're referring to social groupings\n\n00:02:48.998 --> 00:02:52.694\nwith made up demarcations\nthat have changed over time\n\n00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:55.254\nand vary around the world.\n\n00:02:55.278 --> 00:02:58.494\nAs a legal scholar, I've also studied\n\n00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:00.934\nhow lawmakers, not biologists,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.798\nhave invented the legal\ndefinitions of races.\n\n00:03:06.598 --> 00:03:10.054\nAnd it's not just the view\nof social scientists.\n\n00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:12.694\nYou remember when the map\nof the human genome\n\n00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:16.974\nwas unveiled at a White House\nceremony in June 2000?\n\n00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:20.614\nPresident Bill Clinton famously declared,\n\n00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:22.814\n\"I believe one of the great truths\n\n00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:26.014\nto emerge from this triumphant expedition\n\n00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:27.854\ninside the human genome\n\n00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:29.734\nis that in genetic terms,\n\n00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:32.574\nhuman beings, regardless of race,\n\n00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:36.118\nare more than 99.9 percent the same.\"\n\n00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:38.454\nAnd he might have added\n\n00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:42.174\nthat that less than one percent\nof genetic difference\n\n00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:44.718\ndoesn't fall into racial boxes.\n\n00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:49.054\nFrancis Collins, who led\nthe Human Genome Project\n\n00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:50.774\nand now heads NIH,\n\n00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:52.854\nechoed President Clinton.\n\n00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:54.814\n\"I am happy that today,\n\n00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:58.678\nthe only race we're talking about\nis the human race.\"\n\n00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:04.334\nDoctors are supposed to practice\nevidence-based medicine,\n\n00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:08.294\nand they're increasingly called\nto join the genomic revolution.\n\n00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:13.198\nBut their habit of treating patients\nby race lags far behind.\n\n00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:15.374\nTake the estimate\n\n00:04:15.398 --> 00:04:18.654\nof glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.\n\n00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:22.214\nDoctors routinely interpret GFR,\n\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:26.478\nthis important indicator\nof kidney function, by race.\n\n00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:31.037\nAs you can see in this lab test,\n\n00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:36.854\nthe exact same creatinine level,\n\n00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:40.654\nthe concentration\nin the blood of the patient,\n\n00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:45.134\nautomatically produces\na different GFR estimate\n\n00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:49.638\ndepending on whether or not\nthe patient is African-American.\n\n00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:52.278\nWhy?\n\n00:04:53.238 --> 00:04:56.494\nI've been told it's based on an assumption\n\n00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:59.614\nthat African-Americans\nhave more muscle mass\n\n00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:01.838\nthan people of other races.\n\n00:05:02.838 --> 00:05:04.654\nBut what sense does it make\n\n00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:08.134\nfor a doctor to automatically assume\n\n00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:12.038\nI have more muscle mass\nthan that female bodybuilder?\n\n00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:16.534\nWouldn't it be far more accurate\nand evidence-based\n\n00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:20.574\nto determine the muscle mass\nof individual patients\n\n00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:22.638\njust by looking at them?\n\n00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:27.734\nWell, doctors tell me\nthey're using race as a shortcut.\n\n00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:30.494\nIt's a crude but convenient proxy\n\n00:05:30.518 --> 00:05:33.774\nfor more important factors,\nlike muscle mass,\n\n00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:36.174\nenzyme level, genetic traits\n\n00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:38.478\nthey just don't have time to look for.\n\n00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:42.334\nBut race is a bad proxy.\n\n00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:46.494\nIn many cases, race adds\nno relevant information at all.\n\n00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:48.398\nIt's just a distraction.\n\n00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:54.438\nBut race also tends to overwhelm\nthe clinical measures.\n\n00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:59.078\nIt blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,\n\n00:05:59.718 --> 00:06:01.398\nfamily illnesses,\n\n00:06:02.398 --> 00:06:06.734\ntheir history, their own illnesses\nthey might have --\n\n00:06:06.758 --> 00:06:10.278\nall more evidence-based\nthan the patient's race.\n\n00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:16.654\nRace can't substitute\nfor these important clinical measures\n\n00:06:16.678 --> 00:06:20.358\nwithout sacrificing patient well-being.\n\n00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:25.414\nDoctors also tell me\nrace is just one of many factors\n\n00:06:25.438 --> 00:06:26.974\nthey take into account,\n\n00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:29.134\nbut there are numerous medical tests,\n\n00:06:29.158 --> 00:06:30.894\nlike the GFR,\n\n00:06:30.918 --> 00:06:34.174\nthat use race categorically\n\n00:06:34.198 --> 00:06:38.174\nto treat black, white,\nAsian patients differently\n\n00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:40.278\njust because of their race.\n\n00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:47.134\nRace medicine also leaves\npatients of color especially vulnerable\n\n00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:49.958\nto harmful biases and stereotypes.\n\n00:06:50.558 --> 00:06:53.854\nBlack and Latino patients\nare twice as likely\n\n00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:57.374\nto receive no pain medication as whites\n\n00:06:57.398 --> 00:07:01.974\nfor the same painful long bone fractures\n\n00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:04.214\nbecause of stereotypes\n\n00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:08.094\nthat black and brown people\nfeel less pain,\n\n00:07:08.118 --> 00:07:10.054\nexaggerate their pain,\n\n00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:12.798\nand are predisposed to drug addiction.\n\n00:07:14.278 --> 00:07:19.934\nThe Food and Drug Administration has even\napproved a race-specific medicine.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.374\nIt's a pill called BiDil\n\n00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:27.038\nto treat heart failure in self-identified\nAfrican-American patients.\n\n00:07:27.598 --> 00:07:33.774\nA cardiologist developed this drug\nwithout regard to race or genetics,\n\n00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:36.054\nbut it became convenient\n\n00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:37.974\nfor commercial reasons\n\n00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:40.718\nto market the drug to black patients.\n\n00:07:42.318 --> 00:07:44.574\nThe FDA then allowed\n\n00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:47.654\nthe company, the drug company,\n\n00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:51.294\nto test the efficacy in a clinical trial\n\n00:07:51.318 --> 00:07:55.878\nthat only included\nAfrican-American subjects.\n\n00:07:56.718 --> 00:07:58.494\nIt speculated\n\n00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:04.614\nthat race stood in as a proxy\nfor some unknown genetic factor\n\n00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:07.414\nthat affects heart disease\n\n00:08:07.438 --> 00:08:10.198\nor response to drugs.\n\n00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:14.974\nBut think about\nthe dangerous message it sent,\n\n00:08:14.998 --> 00:08:19.454\nthat black people's bodies\nare so substandard,\n\n00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:21.174\na drug tested in them\n\n00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:24.678\nis not guaranteed\nto work in other patients.\n\n00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.614\nIn the end, the drug company's\nmarketing scheme failed.\n\n00:08:30.638 --> 00:08:34.614\nFor one thing, black patients\nwere understandably wary\n\n00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:38.014\nof using a drug just for black people.\n\n00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:41.974\nOne elderly black woman stood up\nin a community meeting and shouted,\n\n00:08:41.998 --> 00:08:44.454\n\"Give me what the white\npeople are taking!\"\n\n00:08:44.478 --> 00:08:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:51.318\nAnd if you find race-specific\nmedicine surprising,\n\n00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:54.093\nwait until you learn\n\n00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.934\nthat many doctors in the United States\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.094\nstill use an updated version\n\n00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:02.014\nof a diagnostic tool\n\n00:09:02.038 --> 00:09:06.494\nthat was developed by a physician\nduring the slavery era,\n\n00:09:06.518 --> 00:09:09.814\na diagnostic tool that is tightly linked\n\n00:09:09.838 --> 00:09:12.198\nto justifications for slavery.\n\n00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:16.174\nDr. Samuel Cartwright graduated\n\n00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:19.574\nfrom the University\nof Pennsylvania Medical School.\n\n00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:23.174\nHe practiced in the Deep South\nbefore the Civil War,\n\n00:09:23.198 --> 00:09:27.318\nand he was a well-known expert\non what was then called \"Negro medicine.\"\n\n00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:31.294\nHe promoted the racial concept of disease,\n\n00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:35.014\nthat people of different races\nsuffer from different diseases\n\n00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:38.678\nand experience\ncommon diseases differently.\n\n00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:43.094\nCartwright argued in the 1850s\n\n00:09:43.118 --> 00:09:47.134\nthat slavery was beneficial\nfor black people\n\n00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:49.214\nfor medical reasons.\n\n00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:54.134\nHe claimed that because black people\nhave lower lung capacity than whites,\n\n00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:56.718\nforced labor was good for them.\n\n00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:00.054\nHe wrote in a medical journal,\n\n00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:03.494\n\"It is the red vital blood\nsent to the brain\n\n00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:07.854\nthat liberates their minds\nwhen under the white man's control,\n\n00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:11.614\nand it is the want of sufficiency\nof red vital blood\n\n00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:16.038\nthat chains their minds to ignorance\nand barbarism when in freedom.\"\n\n00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:20.254\nTo support this theory,\nCartwright helped to perfect\n\n00:10:20.278 --> 00:10:25.118\na medical device for measuring breathing\ncalled the spirometer\n\n00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:30.238\nto show the presumed deficiency\nin black people's lungs.\n\n00:10:31.838 --> 00:10:37.374\nToday, doctors still\nuphold Cartwright's claim\n\n00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:40.014\nthe black people as a race\n\n00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:43.038\nhave lower lung capacity\nthan white people.\n\n00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:48.534\nSome even use a modern day spirometer\n\n00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:52.294\nthat actually has a button labeled \"race\"\n\n00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.974\nso the machine adjusts the measurement\n\n00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:58.974\nfor each patient\naccording to his or her race.\n\n00:10:58.998 --> 00:11:02.838\nIt's a well-known function\ncalled \"correcting for race.\"\n\n00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:11.318\nThe problem with race medicine\nextends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.\n\n00:11:11.878 --> 00:11:16.334\nIts focus on innate\nracial differences in disease\n\n00:11:16.358 --> 00:11:19.454\ndiverts attention and resources\n\n00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.694\nfrom the social determinants\n\n00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:25.694\nthat cause appalling\nracial gaps in health:\n\n00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.038\nlack of access\nto high-quality medical care;\n\n00:11:29.518 --> 00:11:32.358\nfood deserts in poor neighborhoods;\n\n00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:36.398\nexposure to environmental toxins;\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.238\nhigh rates of incarceration;\n\n00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:44.238\nand experiencing the stress\nof racial discrimination.\n\n00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:48.854\nYou see, race is not a biological category\n\n00:11:48.878 --> 00:11:52.294\nthat naturally produces\nthese health disparities\n\n00:11:52.318 --> 00:11:54.558\nbecause of genetic difference.\n\n00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:57.814\nRace is a social category\n\n00:11:57.838 --> 00:12:01.494\nthat has staggering\nbiological consequences,\n\n00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:06.438\nbut because of the impact\nof social inequality on people's health.\n\n00:12:07.118 --> 00:12:11.254\nYet race medicine pretends\nthe answer to these gaps in health\n\n00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:14.494\ncan be found in a race-specific pill.\n\n00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:17.254\nIt's much easier and more lucrative\n\n00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.038\nto market a technological fix\n\n00:12:20.638 --> 00:12:22.774\nfor these gaps in health\n\n00:12:22.798 --> 00:12:27.598\nthan to deal with the structural\ninequities that produce them.\n\n00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:34.254\nThe reason I'm so passionate\nabout ending race medicine\n\n00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:37.334\nisn't just because it's bad medicine.\n\n00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:39.214\nI'm also on this mission\n\n00:12:39.238 --> 00:12:42.174\nbecause the way doctors practice medicine\n\n00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:47.838\ncontinues to promote\na false and toxic view of humanity.\n\n00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:54.894\nDespite the many visionary breakthroughs\nin medicine we've been learning about,\n\n00:12:54.918 --> 00:12:57.534\nthere's a failure of imagination\n\n00:12:57.558 --> 00:12:59.278\nwhen it comes to race.\n\n00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:03.798\nWould you imagine with me, just a moment:\n\n00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:10.678\nWhat would happen if doctors\nstopped treating patients by race?\n\n00:13:12.318 --> 00:13:14.854\nSuppose they rejected\n\n00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:18.574\nan 18th-century classification system\n\n00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:22.334\nand incorporated instead\nthe most advanced knowledge\n\n00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:25.294\nof human genetic diversity and unity,\n\n00:13:25.318 --> 00:13:31.478\nthat human beings cannot be categorized\ninto biological races?\n\n00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:37.334\nWhat if, instead of using race\nas a crude proxy\n\n00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.734\nfor

And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies. I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident. And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair. And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap. And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon.What is a functional neurosurgeon? It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies. You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function. It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain. However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair. And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain. I think that we are approaching this dream.And I would like to show you that we are very close to this. And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself.So the story started 15 years ago. At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room. I often had to take care of patients with head trauma. You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure. And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure. And to do that, you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain. So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them.What do I mean by that? We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue. It's not an easy task. Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family. So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive. So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells. And after many attempts, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois did it. And that's what he saw under his microscope.And that was, for us, a major surprise. Why? Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells. And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body. The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain. So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater.And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells \u2014 cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly. And they never die, they're immortal cells. But these cells behave differently. They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died. So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.And it took us a long time to understand where they came from. They come from these cells. These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells. All of you have them in your brain. They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells. They have a very important role during the development stage. When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself. But why do they stay in your head? This, we don't know. We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions. But it's not so sure. But there is one clear thing \u2014 that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture. And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain. And we had to prove this.So to prove it, we decided to design an experimental paradigm. The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-Fran\u00e7ois did it in his lab. And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain. And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual. We call these autologous grafts \u2014 autografts.So the first question we had, \"What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?\" Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys.So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear.In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained \u2014 and they became mature neurons. And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope. Those are the cells that were re-implanted. And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture.But we could not stop here, of course. Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion? So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task. They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray. They were very good at it. And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion. So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore. And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke. Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey.So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells. So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered. He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion. He's not so accurate, not so quick. And look now when we re-implant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.(Applause)It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you. Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells. We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on. We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example. But our dream is still to implant them in humans. And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, \"I know somebody who can use this.\" I do, in any case. And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials?Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs) So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials.BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?BG: If you project yourself \u2014 having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available?JB: So, it's very difficult to say. It depends, first, on the approval of the trial. Will the regulation allow us to do it soon? And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients. So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment. And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial. You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody.BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.

second-case scenario,\n\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.971\nwe performed the lesion,\n\n00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:06.135\nwe re-implanted exactly the same cells,\n\n00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.232\nand in this case, the cells remained --\n\n00:07:10.256 --> 00:07:13.053\nand they became mature neurons.\n\n00:07:13.782 --> 00:07:17.569\nAnd that's the image of what\nwe could observe under the microscope.\n\n00:07:17.593 --> 00:07:20.147\nThose are the cells\nthat were re-implanted.\n\n00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:22.744\nAnd the proof they carry,\n\n00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:25.945\nthese little spots, those\nare the cells that we've labeled\n\n00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.801\nin vitro, when they were in culture.\n\n00:07:29.713 --> 00:07:31.913\nBut we could not stop here, of course.\n\n00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:37.116\nDo these cells also help a monkey\nto recover after a lesion?\n\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.622\nSo for that, we trained monkeys\nto perform a manual dexterity task.\n\n00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:45.664\nThey had to retrieve\nfood pellets from a tray.\n\n00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:47.183\nThey were very good at it.\n\n00:07:47.854 --> 00:07:51.326\nAnd when they had reached\na plateau of performance,\n\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:57.645\nwe did a lesion in the motor cortex\ncorresponding to the hand motion.\n\n00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:59.526\nSo the monkeys were plegic,\n\n00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.462\nthey could not move their hand anymore.\n\n00:08:02.123 --> 00:08:05.677\nAnd exactly the same as humans would do,\n\n00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.627\nthey spontaneously recovered\nto a certain extent,\n\n00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.671\nexactly the same as after a stroke.\n\n00:08:10.695 --> 00:08:12.482\nPatients are completely plegic,\n\n00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:17.614\nand then they try to recover\ndue to a brain plasticity mechanism,\n\n00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:19.278\nthey recover to a certain extent,\n\n00:08:19.302 --> 00:08:21.143\nexactly the same for the monkey.\n\n00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.611\nSo when we were sure that the monkey\nhad reached his plateau\n\n00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:27.063\nof spontaneous recovery,\n\n00:08:27.087 --> 00:08:29.662\nwe implanted his own cells.\n\n00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:35.781\nSo on the left side, you see the monkey\nthat has spontaneously recovered.\n\n00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:42.016\nHe's at about 40 to 50 percent\nof his previous performance\n\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.252\nbefore the lesion.\n\n00:08:44.037 --> 00:08:46.807\nHe's not so accurate, not so quick.\n\n00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:50.793\nAnd look now when we re-implant the cells:\n\n00:08:50.817 --> 00:08:55.070\nTwo months after re-implantation,\nthe same individual.\n\n00:08:57.213 --> 00:09:04.131\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:08.283\nIt was also very exciting results\nfor us, I tell you.\n\n00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:12.985\nSince that time, we've understood\nmuch more about these cells.\n\n00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:15.929\nWe know that we can cryopreserve them,\n\n00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:17.815\nwe can use them later on.\n\n00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:22.062\nWe know that we can apply them\nin other neuropathological models,\n\n00:09:22.086 --> 00:09:24.055\nlike Parkinson's disease, for example.\n\n00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:27.236\nBut our dream is still\nto implant them in humans.\n\n00:09:28.427 --> 00:09:32.177\nAnd I really hope that I'll be able\nto show you soon\n\n00:09:33.563 --> 00:09:38.557\nthat the human brain is giving us\nthe tools to repair itself.\n\n00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:39.901\nThank you.\n\n00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:45.911\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.237\nBruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,\n\n00:09:49.261 -->

thinking, \"I know\nsomebody who can use this.\"\n\n00:09:57.038 --> 00:09:59.298\nI do, in any case.\n\n00:09:59.322 --> 00:10:01.618\nAnd of course the question is,\n\n00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:03.720\nwhat are the biggest obstacles\n\n00:10:03.744 --> 00:10:06.535\nbefore you can go\ninto human clinical trials?\n\n00:10:07.623 --> 00:10:13.129\nJocelyne Bloch: The biggest\nobstacles

But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects \u2014(Laughter)are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal. Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: \"I came to realize...\"(Laughter)\"I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?\"Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap.(Laughter)There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody.We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before. We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations.Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog.(Laughter)Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have something to learn.Bill Nye: \"Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't.\" I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, \"Were you terrified?\" you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is \"terrified,\" and the answer is \"Yes, I was\" or \"No, I wasn't.\" \"Were you angry?\" \"Yes, I was very angry.\" Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like, \"What was that like?\" \"How did that feel?\" Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.(Laughter)And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go.Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap.Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly, it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, \"I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers.\"(Laughter)Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. Don't do that.Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out.Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, \"If your mouth is open, you're not learning.\" And Calvin Coolidge said, \"No man ever listened his way out of a job.\"(Laughter)Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.(Laughter)You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, \"Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply.\"One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. \u2014 My Sister](Laughter)(Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people.You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, \"Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer.\" And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed.You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.Thanks.(Applause)", "id": 2435, "subtitle":

friends\n\n00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:55.198\nthan they are to talk\nto them face to face.\n\n00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:58.094\nThere's this great piece in The Atlantic.\n\n00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.974\nIt was written by a high school teacher\nnamed Paul Barnwell.\n\n00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:03.134\nAnd he gave his kids\na communication project.\n\n00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:06.894\nHe wanted to teach them how to speak\non a specific subject without using notes.\n\n00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.823\nAnd he said this: \"I came to realize...\"\n\n00:02:08.847 --> 00:02:12.134\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:15.334\n\"I came to realize\nthat conversational competence\n\n00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:19.454\nmight be the single\nmost overlooked skill we fail to teach.\n\n00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:23.774\nKids spend hours each day engaging\nwith ideas and each other through screens,\n\n00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:25.654\nbut rarely do they have an opportunity\n\n00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.254\nto hone their interpersonal\ncommunications skills.\n\n00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:31.454\nIt might sound like a funny question,\nbut we have to ask ourselves:\n\n00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:33.414\nIs there any 21st-century skill\n\n00:02:33.438 --> 00:02:39.014\nmore important than being able to sustain\ncoherent, confident conversation?\"\n\n00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:41.254\nNow, I make my living talking to people:\n\n00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:43.534\nNobel Prize winners, truck drivers,\n\n00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:45.974\nbillionaires, kindergarten teachers,\n\n00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.694\nheads of state, plumbers.\n\n00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:51.766\nI talk to people that I like.\nI talk to people that I don't like.\n\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.574\nI talk to some people that I disagree with\ndeeply on a personal level.\n\n00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:58.374\nBut I still have\na great conversation with them.\n\n00:02:58.398 --> 00:03:02.294\nSo I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes\nor so teaching you how to talk\n\n00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:03.678\nand how to listen.\n\n00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:07.374\nMany of you have already heard\na lot of advice on this,\n\n00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:09.374\nthings like look the person in the eye,\n\n00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:13.214\nthink of interesting topics\nto discuss in advance,\n\n00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:18.014\nlook, nod and smile to show\nthat you're paying attention,\n\n00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:20.934\nrepeat back what you just heard\nor summarize it.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.694\nSo I want you to forget all of that.\n\n00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:23.934\nIt is crap.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.974\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:31.254\nThere is no reason to learn\nhow to show you're paying attention\n\n00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:34.934\nif you are in fact paying attention.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:39.734\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:43.414\nNow, I actually use the exact\nsame skills as a professional interviewer\n\n00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:46.374\nthat I do in regular life.\n\n00:03:46.398 --> 00:03:49.854\nSo, I'm going to teach you\nhow to interview people,\n\n00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:53.694\nand that's actually going to help you\nlearn how to be better conversationalists.\n\n00:03:53.718 --> 00:03:55.094\nLearn to have a conversation\n\n00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:57.454\nwithout wasting your time,\nwithout getting bored,\n\n00:03:57.478 --> 00:04:00.774\nand, please God,\nwithout offending anybody.\n\n00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.014\nWe've all had really great conversations.\n\n00:04:03.038 --> 00:04:05.214\nWe've had them before.\nWe know what it's like.\n\n00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:08.934\nThe kind of conversation where you\nwalk away feeling engaged and inspired,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.414\nor where you feel\nlike you've made a real connection\n\n00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:13.534\nor you've been perfectly understood.\n\n00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:14.774\nThere is no reason\n\n00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:18.054\nwhy most of your interactions\ncan't be like that.\n\n00:04:18.078 --> 00:04:21.294\nSo I have 10 basic rules.\nI'm going to walk you through all of them,\n\n00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:25.054\nbut honestly, if you just choose\none of them and master it,\n\n00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:27.814\nyou'll already enjoy better conversations.\n\n00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.054\nNumber one: Don't multitask.\n\n00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:32.254\nAnd I don't mean\njust set down your cell phone\n\n00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:35.134\nor your tablet or your car keys\nor whatever is in your hand.\n\n00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:37.054\nI mean, be present.\n\n00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:39.334\nBe in that moment.\n\n00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:41.974\nDon't think about your argument\nyou had with your boss.\n\n00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:44.614\nDon't think about what\nyou're going to have for dinner.\n\n00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:46.694\nIf you want to get out\nof the conversation,\n\n00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:48.094\nget out of the conversation,\n\n00:04:48.118 --> 00:04:50.254\nbut don't be half in it\nand half out of it.\n\n00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:52.854\nNumber two: Don't pontificate.\n\n00:04:52.878 --> 00:04:55.054\nIf you want to state your opinion\n\n00:04:55.078 --> 00:05:01.014\nwithout any opportunity for response\nor argument or pushback or growth,\n\n00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:02.494\nwrite a blog.\n\n00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:05.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:08.974\nNow, there's a really good reason\nwhy I don't allow pundits on my show:\n\n00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:10.774\nBecause they're really boring.\n\n00:05:10.798 --> 00:05:14.656\nIf they're conservative, they're going to\nhate Obama and food stamps and abortion.\n\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.654\nIf they're liberal, they're going to hate\n\n00:05:16.678 --> 00:05:18.894\nbig banks and oil corporations\nand Dick Cheney.\n\n00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.174\nTotally predictable.\n\n00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:21.894\nAnd you don't want to be like that.\n\n00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:27.454\nYou need to enter every conversation\nassuming that you have something to learn.\n\n00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:29.614\nThe famed therapist M. Scott Peck said\n\n00:05:29.638 --> 00:05:34.054\nthat true listening requires\na setting aside of oneself.\n\n00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:37.398\nAnd sometimes that means\nsetting aside your personal opinion.\n\n00:05:38.158 --> 00:05:41.454\nHe said that sensing this acceptance,\n\n00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:43.734\nthe speaker will become\nless and less vulnerable\n\n00:05:43.758 --> 00:05:46.614\nand more and more likely\nto open up the inner recesses\n\n00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.294\nof his or her mind to the listener.\n\n00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:52.078\nAgain, assume that you have\nsomething to learn.\n\n00:05:52.838 --> 00:05:56.518\nBill Nye: \"Everyone you will ever meet\nknows something that you don't.\"\n\n00:05:57.198 --> 00:05:58.534\nI put it this way:\n\n00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:01.718\nEverybody is an expert in something.\n\n00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:05.934\nNumber three: Use open-ended questions.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.014\nIn this case, take a cue from journalists.\n\n00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:11.134\nStart your questions with who,\nwhat, when, where, why or how.\n\n00:06:11.158 --> 00:06:14.854\nIf you put in a complicated question,\nyou're going to get a simple answer out.\n\n00:06:14.878 --> 00:06:17.214\nIf I ask you, \"Were you terrified?\"\n\n00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:20.414\nyou're going to respond to the most\npowerful word in that sentence,\n\n00:06:20.438 --> 00:06:23.774\nwhich is \"terrified,\" and the answer is\n\"Yes, I was\" or \"No, I wasn't.\"\n\n00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:25.798\n\"Were you angry?\" \"Yes, I was very angry.\"\n\n00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:28.894\nLet them describe it.\nThey're the ones that know.\n\n00:06:28.918 --> 00:06:31.894\nTry asking them things like,\n\"What was that like?\"\n\n00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:33.374\n\"How did that feel?\"\n\n00:06:33.398 --> 00:06:37.694\nBecause then they might have to stop\nfor a moment and think about it,\n\n00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:40.694\nand you're going to get\na much more interesting response.\n\n00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:43.038\nNumber four: Go with the flow.\n\n00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:46.494\nThat means thoughts\nwill come into your mind\n\n00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:49.574\nand you need to let them\ngo out of your mind.\n\n00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.574\nWe've heard interviews often\n\n00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:54.054\nin which a guest is talking\nfor several minutes\n\n00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:56.494\nand then the host comes back in\nand asks a question\n\n00:06:56.518 --> 00:06:59.934\nwhich seems like it comes out of nowhere,\nor it's already been answered.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.894\nThat means the host probably\nstopped listening two minutes ago\n\n00:07:02.918 --> 00:07:06.334\nbecause he thought\nof this really clever question,\n\n00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:09.374\nand he was just bound\nand determined to say that.\n\n00:07:09.398 --> 00:07:11.374\nAnd we do the exact same thing.\n\n00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:14.014\nWe're sitting there having\na conversation with someone,\n\n00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:17.494\nand then we remember that time\nthat we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.\n\n00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:18.854\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:20.494\nAnd we stop listening.\n\n00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:22.574\nStories and ideas\nare going to come to you.\n\n00:07:22.598 --> 00:07:25.478\nYou need to let them come and let them go.\n\n00:07:26.038 --> 00:07:29.758\nNumber five: If you don't know,\nsay that you don't know.\n\n00:07:30.758 --> 00:07:33.054\nNow, people on the radio,\nespecially on NPR,\n\n00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:36.014\nare much more aware\nthat they're going on the record,\n\n00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:39.614\nand so they're more careful\nabout what they claim to be an expert in\n\n00:07:39.638 --> 00:07:41.774\nand what they claim to know for sure.\n\n00:07:41.798 --> 00:07:44.174\nDo that. Err on the side of caution.\n\n00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:45.958\nTalk should not be cheap.\n\n00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:50.278\nNumber six: Don't equate\nyour experience with theirs.\n\n00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:54.014\nIf they're talking\nabout having lost a family member,\n\n00:07:54.038 --> 00:07:56.894\ndon't start talking about the time\nyou lost a family member.\n\n00:07:56.918 --> 00:07:59.774\nIf they're talking about the trouble\nthey're having at work,\n\n00:07:59.798 --> 00:08:02.134\ndon't tell them about\nhow much you hate your job.\n\n00:08:02.158 --> 00:08:04.094\nIt's not the same. It is never the same.\n\n00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:05.894\nAll experiences are individual.\n\n00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:08.598\nAnd, more importantly,\nit is not about you.\n\n00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:12.974\nYou don't need to take that moment\nto prove how amazing you are\n\n00:08:12.998 --> 00:08:14.398\nor how much you've suffered.\n\n00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.134\nSomebody asked Stephen Hawking once\nwhat his IQ was, and he said,\n\n00:08:18.158 --> 00:08:21.038\n\"I have no idea. People who brag\nabout their IQs are losers.\"\n\n00:08:21.078 --> 00:08:23.014\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:26.398\nConversations are not\na promotional opportunity.\n\n00:08:28.518 --> 00:08:29.758\nNumber seven:\n\n00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:32.774\nTry not to repeat yourself.\n\n00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:35.174\nIt's condescending,\nand it's really boring,\n\n00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:36.854\nand we tend to do it a lot.\n\n00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:40.814\nEspecially in work conversations\nor in conversations with our kids,\n\n00:08:40.838 --> 00:08:42.094\nwe have a point to make,\n\n00:08:42.118 --> 00:08:44.517\nso we just keep rephrasing it\nover and over.\n\n00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:46.814\nDon't do that.\n\n00:08:46.838 --> 00:08:49.134\nNumber eight: Stay out of the weeds.\n\n00:08:49.158 --> 00:08:51.973\nFrankly, people don't care\n\n00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:54.613\nabout the years, the names,\n\n00:08:54.637 --> 00:08:56.574\nthe dates, all those details\n\n00:08:56.598 --> 00:08:59.054\nthat you're struggling\nto come up with in your mind.\n\n00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:01.278\nThey don't care.\nWhat they care about is you.\n\n00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:03.438\nThey care about what you're like,\n\n00:09:04.038 --> 00:09:05.734\nwhat you have in common.\n\n00:09:05.758 --> 00:09:08.398\nSo forget the details. Leave them out.\n\n00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:10.054\nNumber nine:\n\n00:09:10.078 --> 00:09:13.334\nThis is not the last one,\nbut it is the most important one.\n\n00:09:13.358 --> 00:09:14.558\nListen.\n\n00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:18.334\nI cannot tell you how many\nreally important people have said\n\n00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:22.254\nthat listening is perhaps the most,\nthe number one most important skill\n\n00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:23.494\nthat you could develop.\n\n00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:25.414\nBuddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,\n\n00:09:25.438 --> 00:09:27.974\n\"If your mouth is open,\nyou're not learning.\"\n\n00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:32.278\nAnd Calvin Coolidge said, \"No man\never listened his way out of a job.\"\n\n00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.094\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:36.318\nWhy do we not listen to each other?\n\n00:09:36.878 --> 00:09:38.838\nNumber one, we'd rather talk.\n\n00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:41.254\nWhen I'm talking, I'm in control.\n\n00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:43.734\nI don't have to hear anything\nI'm not interested in.\n\n00:09:43.758 --> 00:09:45.134\nI'm the center of attention.\n\n00:09:45.158 --> 00:09:47.054\nI can bolster my own identity.\n\n00:09:47.078 --> 00:09:48.454\nBut there's another reason:\n\n00:09:48.478 --> 00:09:49.934\nWe get distracted.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.494\nThe average person talks\nat about 225 word per minute,\n\n00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:57.814\nbut we can listen at up to\n500 words per minute.\n\n00:09:57.838 --> 00:10:01.814\nSo our minds are filling in\nthose other 275 words.\n\n00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:05.014\nAnd look, I know,\nit takes effort and energy\n\n00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:07.334\nto actually pay attention to someone,\n\n00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:10.334\nbut if you can't do that,\nyou're not in a conversation.\n\n00:10:10.358 --> 00:10:13.214\nYou're just two people shouting out\nbarely related sentences\n\n00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.494\nin the same place.\n\n00:10:14.518 --> 00:10:16.414\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:16.438 --> 00:10:18.934\nYou have to listen to one another.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.854\nStephen Covey said it very beautifully.\n\n00:10:20.878 --> 00:10:24.814\nHe said, \"Most of us don't listen\nwith the intent to understand.\n\n00:10:24.838 --> 00:10:27.518\nWe listen with the intent to reply.\"\n\n00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:32.774\nOne more rule, number 10,\nand it's this one: Be brief.\n\n00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:36.294\n[A good conversation is like a miniskirt;\nshort enough to retain interest,\n\n00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:38.734\nbut long enough to cover\nthe subject. -- My Sister]\n\n00:10:38.758 --> 00:10:39.974\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:39.998 --> 00:10:42.414\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:42.438 --> 00:10:46.758\nAll of this boils down to the same\nbasic concept, and it is this one:\n\n00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:50.134\nBe interested in other people.\n\n00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:52.574\nYou know, I grew up\nwith a very famous grandfather,\n\n00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:54.654\nand there was kind of a ritual in my home.\n\n00:10:54.678 --> 00:10:57.134\nPeople would come over\nto talk to my grandparents,\n\n00:10:57.158 --> 00:11:00.014\nand after they would leave,\nmy mother would come over to us,\n\n00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:02.014\nand she'd say, \"Do you know who that was?\n\n00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:03.894\nShe was the runner-up to Miss America.\n\n00:11:03.918 --> 00:11:05.614\nHe was the mayor of Sacramento.\n\n00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:08.814\nShe won a Pulitzer Prize.\nHe's a Russian ballet dancer.\"\n\n00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:12.214\nAnd I kind of grew up assuming\n\n00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.998\neveryone has some hidden,\namazing thing about them.\n\n00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:18.518\nAnd honestly, I think\nit's what makes me a better host.\n\n00:11:19.238 --> 00:11:22.054\nI keep my mouth shut\nas often as I possibly can,\n\n00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:23.494\nI keep my mind open,\n\n00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:26.014\nand I'm always prepared to be amazed,\n\n00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:27.998\nand I'm never disappointed.\n\n00:11:28.718 --> 00:11:30.574\nYou do the same thing.\n\n00:11:30.598 --> 00:11:33.014\nGo out, talk to people,\n\n00:11:33.038 --> 00:11:34.254\nlisten to people,\n\n00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:37.758\nand, most importantly,\nbe prepared to be amazed.\n\n00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:39.614\nThanks.\n\n00:11:39.638 --> 00:11:42.918\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My year of saying yes to everything", "duration": "1124", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shonda_rhimes_my_year_of_saying_yes_to_everything", "transcript": "So a while ago, I tried an experiment. For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me. Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone, I forced myself to say yes to. Did I want to speak in public? No, but yes. Did I want to be on live TV? No, but yes. Did I want to try acting? No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.And a crazy thing happened: the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear, made it not scary. My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone. It's amazing, the power of one word. \"Yes\" changed my life. \"Yes\" changed me. But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way, in a way I never imagined, and it started with a question from my toddler.I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson, and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as \"honey.\" as though she's a Southern waitress.(Laughter)\"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup.\"(Laughter)The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, \"Yes.\" And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family. I made a vow that from now on, every time one of my children asks me to play, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I say yes, every single time. Almost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it. And it's had a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family. But it's also had a stunning side effect, and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it, that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career.See, I have what most people would call a dream job. I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living. Dream job. No. I'm a titan. Dream job. I create television. I executive produce television. I make television, a great deal of television. In one way or another, this TV season, I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV \u2014(Applause)Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four. Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before. The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars. Let's just say five. A new episode made every nine days times four shows, so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 16 episodes going on at all times: 24 episodes of \"Grey's,\" 21 episodes of \"Scandal,\" 15 episodes of \"How To Get Away With Murder,\" 10 episodes of \"The Catch,\" that's 70 hours of TV, that's 350 million dollars for a season. In America, my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night. Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people. My brain is global, and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced, so on top of everything else, I need to find time, real quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world. You know who else is doing that? Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan. Dream job.(Applause)Now, I don't tell you this to impress you. I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word \"writer.\" I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard, whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home, take me seriously when I talk about working, so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day, so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming. It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears. I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it, there is no other feeling. For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air. It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas. It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon. It is being Beyonc\u00e9. And it is all of those things at the same time. I love working. It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious, and what makes it all so good is the hum. There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good. A hum begins in my brain, and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road, and I could drive it forever. And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum, they assume that I'm talking about the writing, that my writing brings me joy. And don't get me wrong, it does. But the hum \u2014 it wasn't until I started making television that I started working, working and making and building and creating and collaborating, that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum. The hum is more than writing. The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug. The hum is music. The hum is light and air. The hum is God's whisper right in my ear. And when you have a hum like that, you can't help but strive for greatness. That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost. That's called the hum. Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.(Laughter)Maybe it's called genius. Maybe it's called ego. Maybe it's just fear of failure. I don't know. I just know that I'm not built for failure, and I just know that I love the hum. I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.But here's the thing: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken, the more work there is to do, the more balls in the air, the more eyes on me, the more history stares, the more expectations there are. The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work. And what did I say about work? I love working, right? The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the hum. I like that hum. I love that hum. I need that hum. I am that hum. Am I nothing but that hum?And then the hum stopped. Overworked, overused, overdone, burned out. The hum stopped.Now, my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan. Harper tells people, \"My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny.\" And Emerson says, \"Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand.\" They're children of a titan. They're baby titans. They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped. The hum of the engine died. I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine. The hum would not come back. My hum was broken. I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work, 15-hour days, working straight through the weekends, no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits, full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever. But there was no hum. Inside me was silence. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four. Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time ... I was the perfect titan. I was a titan you could take home to your mother. All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun. And it was my life. It was all I did. I was the hum, and the hum was me. So what do you do when the thing you do, the work you love, starts to taste like dust?Now, I know somebody's out there thinking, \"Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady.\"(Laughter)But you know, you do, if you make, if you work, if you love what you do, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter, being Bill Gates, if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum, if you know the hum, if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum, when the hum stops, who are you? What are you? What am I? Am I still a titan? If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question. I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says, \"Momma, wanna play?\"And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things. One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything, and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me \"honey.\" She's not calling everyone \"honey\" anymore. When did that happen? I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum, and here she is changing right before my eyes. And so she says, \"Momma, wanna play?\" And I say, \"Yes.\" There's nothing special about it. We play, and we're joined by her sisters, and there's a lot of laughing, and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops. Nothing out of the ordinary.(Laughter)And yet, it is extraordinary, because in my pain and my panic, in the homelessness of my humlessness, I have nothing to do but pay attention. I focus. I am still. The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist. All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.(Laughter)It's all peace and simplicity. The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe. I can barely believe I'm breathing. Play is the opposite of work. And I am happy. Something in me loosens. A door in my brain swings open, and a rush of energy comes. And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen. I feel it. A hum creeps back. Not at full volume, barely there, it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there. Not the hum, but a hum.And now I feel like I know a very magical secret. Well, let's not get carried away. It's just love. That's all it is. No magic. No secret. It's just love. It's just something we forgot. The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan, that's just a replacement. If I have to ask you who I am, if I have to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is, I have forgotten what the real hum is. The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific. The hum is joy-specific. The real hum is love-specific. The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life. The real hum is confidence and peace. The real hum ignores the stare of history, and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure. The real hum is singular and original. The real hum is God's whisper in my ear, but maybe God was whispering the wrong words, because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?It's just love. We could all use a little more love, a lot more love. Any time my child asks me to play, I will say yes. I make it a firm rule for one reason, to give myself permission, to free me from all of my workaholic guilt. It's a law, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, not if I want to feel the hum.I wish it were that easy, but I'm not good at playing. I don't like it. I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work. The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face. I don't like playing. I work all the time because I like working. I like working more than I like being at home. Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle, because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?Well, me. I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan. I've got issues.(Laughter)And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.(Laughter)We run around the yard, up and back and up and back. We have 30-second dance parties. We sing show tunes. We play with balls. I blow bubbles and they pop them. And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time. I itch for my cell phone always. But it is OK. My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up. I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place.You can do it too, say yes every time your child asks you to play. Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes? You're right, but you can still do this. You have time. You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet. Your child does not think you're that interesting.(Laughter)You only need 15 minutes. My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else. It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes. If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.(Laughter)And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I'm Parent of the Year.(Laughter)15 minutes is all you need. I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day. Uninterrupted is the key. No cell phone, no laundry, no anything. You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table. You have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes. My kids are my happy place, they're my world, but it doesn't have to be your kids, the fuel that feeds your hum, the place where life feels more good than not good. It's not about playing with your kids, it's about joy. It's about playing in general. Give yourself the 15 minutes. Find what makes you feel good. Just figure it out and play in that arena.I'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed, seeing friends, reading books, staring into space. \"Wanna play?\" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show, right around the time I became a titan-in-training, right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown. 15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for 15 minutes? Turns out, nothing. The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return, as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away. Work doesn't work without play.It takes a little time, but after a few months, one day the floodgates open and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me, and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas, and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it, and I love working again. But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum. I don't need that hum. I am not that hum. That hum is not me, not anymore. I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends. I am that hum. Life's hum. Love's hum. Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me, and I am so grateful. And I don't give a crap about being a titan, because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world. My brain is still global. My campfires still burn. The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are. The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother. The more I play, the freer my mind becomes. The more I play, the better I work. The more I play, the more I feel the hum, the nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the other hum, the real hum, life's hum. The more I feel that hum, the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned, awkward, brand new, alive non-titan feels like me. The more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am. I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine. That part of the job, that's living the dream. That's the dream of the job. Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.I said yes to less work and more play.

some kind of shift inside me\nwhen the work gets good.\n\n00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:02.734\nA hum begins in my brain,\n\n00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:06.454\nand it grows and it grows\nand that hum sounds like the open road,\n\n00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:08.478\nand I could drive it forever.\n\n00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:11.739\nAnd a lot of people,\nwhen I try to explain the hum,\n\n00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.694\nthey assume that I'm talking\nabout the writing,\n\n00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:16.174\nthat my writing brings me joy.\n\n00:05:16.198 --> 00:05:18.518\nAnd don't get me wrong, it does.\n\n00:05:19.358 --> 00:05:20.558\nBut the hum --\n\n00:05:21.598 --> 00:05:23.614\nit wasn't until I started\nmaking television\n\n00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:25.854\nthat I started working, working and making\n\n00:05:25.878 --> 00:05:28.494\nand building and creating\nand collaborating,\n\n00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat I discovered this thing,\nthis buzz, this rush, this hum.\n\n00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:35.774\nThe hum is more than writing.\n\n00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:39.054\nThe hum is action and activity.\nThe hum is a drug.\n\n00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:41.694\nThe hum is music.\nThe hum is light and air.\n\n00:05:41.718 --> 00:05:45.078\nThe hum is God's whisper right in my ear.\n\n00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:47.358\nAnd when you have a hum like that,\n\n00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:50.614\nyou can't help but strive for greatness.\n\n00:05:50.638 --> 00:05:55.238\nThat feeling, you can't help\nbut strive for greatness at any cost.\n\n00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:57.278\nThat's called the hum.\n\n00:05:58.078 --> 00:06:01.654\nOr, maybe it's called being a workaholic.\n\n00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:03.334\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:03.358 --> 00:06:05.158\nMaybe it's called genius.\n\n00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:07.758\nMaybe it's called ego.\n\n00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:10.718\nMaybe it's just fear of failure.\n\n00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.254\nI don't know.\n\n00:06:13.278 --> 00:06:17.094\nI just know that\nI'm not built for failure,\n\n00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:18.958\nand I just know that I love the hum.\n\n00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:22.054\nI just know that I want\nto tell you I'm a titan,\n\n00:06:22.078 --> 00:06:24.534\nand I know that\nI don't want to question it.\n\n00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:25.758\nBut here's the thing:\n\n00:06:27.038 --> 00:06:28.854\nthe more successful I become,\n\n00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:32.494\nthe more shows, the more episodes,\nthe more barriers broken,\n\n00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:33.998\nthe more work there is to do,\n\n00:06:34.718 --> 00:06:35.974\nthe more balls in the air,\n\n00:06:35.998 --> 00:06:38.894\nthe more eyes on me,\nthe more history stares,\n\n00:06:38.918 --> 00:06:40.678\nthe more expectations there are.\n\n00:06:41.238 --> 00:06:43.334\nThe more I work to be successful,\n\n00:06:43.358 --> 00:06:44.718\nthe more I need to work.\n\n00:06:45.878 --> 00:06:47.614\nAnd what did I say about work?\n\n00:06:47.638 --> 00:06:48.958\nI love working, right?\n\n00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.974\nThe nation I'm building,\nthe marathon I'm running,\n\n00:06:51.998 --> 00:06:54.214\nthe troops, the canvas,\nthe high note, the hum,\n\n00:06:54.238 --> 00:06:56.094\nthe hum, the hum.\n\n00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:58.174\nI like that hum. I love that hum.\n\n00:06:58.198 --> 00:07:00.998\nI need that hum. I am that hum.\n\n00:07:01.558 --> 00:07:03.558\nAm I nothing but that hum?\n\n00:07:05.278 --> 00:07:06.718\nAnd then the hum stopped.\n\n00:07:07.638 --> 00:07:10.054\nOverworked, overused,\n\n00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:11.374\noverdone, burned out.\n\n00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:13.598\nThe hum stopped.\n\n00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:17.614\nNow, my three daughters\nare used to the truth\n\n00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:19.758\nthat their mother\nis a single working titan.\n\n00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:21.734\nHarper tells people,\n\n00:07:21.758 --> 00:07:24.598\n\"My mom won't be there,\nbut you can text my nanny.\"\n\n00:07:25.198 --> 00:07:28.718\nAnd Emerson says, \"Honey,\nI'm wanting to go to ShondaLand.\"\n\n00:07:29.638 --> 00:07:31.014\nThey're children of a titan.\n\n00:07:31.038 --> 00:07:32.838\nThey're baby titans.\n\n00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:36.758\nThey were 12, 3, and 1\nwhen the hum stopped.\n\n00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.118\nThe hum of the engine died.\n\n00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:42.254\nI stopped loving work.\nI couldn't restart the engine.\n\n00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:44.254\nThe hum would not come back.\n\n00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:46.598\nMy hum was broken.\n\n00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:51.254\nI was doing the same things\nI always did, all the same titan work,\n\n00:07:51.278 --> 00:07:53.734\n15-hour days, working\nstraight through the weekends,\n\n00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:57.094\nno regrets, never surrender,\na titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,\n\n00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:59.318\nfull hearts, clear eyes, yada,

TV,\nthree shows in production at a time,\n\n00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:10.974\nsometimes four.\n\n00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:14.814\nFour television programs, 70 hours of TV,\nthree shows in production at a time ...\n\n00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:16.934\nI was the perfect titan.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.278\nI was a titan you could\ntake home to your mother.\n\n00:08:20.478 --> 00:08:24.038\nAll the

For that brief moment in time, the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe. It was a very big bang.But they didn't release their energy in light. I mean, you know, they're black holes. All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself, making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here. 1.3 billion years ago, Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life. Since then, Earth has made and evolved corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even \u2014 God save us \u2014 the Internet. And about 25 years ago, a particularly audacious set of people \u2014 Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech \u2014 decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes.Now, most people thought they were nuts. But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea. So after decades of development, construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work, they built their detector, called LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.For the last several years, LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy, a tremendous improvement in its detection ability. It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.In early September of 2015, LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details. And on September 14 of 2015, just days after the detector had gone live, the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth. And they passed through you and me. And they passed through the detector.(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life more emotionally intense than that. One is the birth of my daughter. The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill. You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically. Everything I'd been working on \u2014 it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT, who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO, for the past 23 years.So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave. A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time. As the wave passes by, it stretches space and everything in it in one direction, and compresses it in the other. This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity. \"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands.\"So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak. For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 \u2014 and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave \u2014 when the waves hit, they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21. That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes, and a one. That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts. Even with a laser detector five kilometers long \u2014 and that's already crazy \u2014 they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom. And that's preposterous.So towards the end of his classic text on gravity, LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows: He said, \"The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous. But physicists are ingenious, and with the support of a broad lay public, all obstacles will surely be overcome.\" Thorne published that in 1973, 42 years before he succeeded.Now, coming back to LIGO, Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye. I want to explain what that means. Visible light has a wavelength, a size, that's much smaller than the things around you, the features on people's faces, the size of your cell phone. And that's really useful, because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you, by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you.Sound is different. Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long. And that makes it really difficult \u2014 in fact, in practical purposes, impossible \u2014 to make an image of something you really care about. Your child's face. Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds. That's Alice talking. That's Bob interrupting. Silly Bob.So, the same is true of gravitational waves. We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe. But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves, we can hear the story that those waves are telling. And at least for LIGO, the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band. So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound, we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us. For example, listening to gravity, just in this way, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop! If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp, but with a modulation on top of it, so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir! It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.AA: So on September 14, 2015, a date that's definitely going to live in my memory, LIGO heard this:[Whirring sound]So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of \u2014(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses, that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender.AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means. Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe, one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns, whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide. Just imagine the power of that. It's fantastic. And we know it because we heard it.That's the lasting importance of LIGO. It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before. It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible.And there's a lot out there that we can't see \u2014 in practice or even in principle. So supernova, for example: I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae. They're very useful; we've learned a lot about the Universe from them. The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core, and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon. We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light. Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass \u2014 totally transparent. The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe, but we'll never see them, because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow. With gravitational waves, we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning. Perhaps most importantly, I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined \u2014 things that we'll only discover by listening.And in fact, even in that very first event, LIGO found things that we didn't expect. Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration, Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe. They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times, and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology. So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course, how we came to be out of this whole mess.AA: Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible. Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe, to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos. Our job is to dream up and build new observatories \u2014 a whole new generation of observatories \u2014 on the ground, in space.

(Laughs)\n\n00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:25.544\nAllan Adams: So that's my very good friend\nand collaborator, Scott Hughes,\n\n00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.759\na theoretical physicist at MIT,\n\n00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.568\nwho has been studying\ngravitational waves from black holes\n\n00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:34.121\nand the signals that they could impart\non observatories like LIGO,\n\n00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.160\nfor the past 23 years.\n\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.606\nSo let me take a moment to tell you\nwhat I mean by a gravitational wave.\n\n00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:44.515\nA gravitational wave is a ripple\n\n00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.968\nin the shape of space and time.\n\n00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.437\nAs the wave passes by,\n\n00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:51.840\nit stretches space and everything in it\n\n00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.023\nin one direction,\n\n00:03:53.047 --> 00:03:55.038\nand compresses it in the other.\n\n00:03:55.851 --> 00:03:58.900\nThis has led to countless instructors\nof general relativity\n\n00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:02.856\ndoing a really silly dance to demonstrate\nin their classes on general relativity.\n\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.637\n\"It stretches and expands,\nit stretches and expands.\"\n\n00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:10.214\nSo the trouble with gravitational waves\n\n00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:12.856\nis that they're very weak;\nthey're preposterously weak.\n\n00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.658\nFor example, the waves that hit us\non September 14 --\n\n00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:21.376\nand yes, every single one of you\nstretched and compressed\n\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.970\nunder the action of that wave --\n\n00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:26.597\nwhen the waves hit, they stretched\nthe average person\n\n00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.732\nby one part in 10 to the 21.\n\n00:04:29.756 --> 00:04:32.628\nThat's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,\n\n00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:33.818\nand a one.\n\n00:04:35.477 --> 00:04:38.942\nThat's why everyone thought\nthe LIGO people were nuts.\n\n00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:45.363\nEven with a laser detector five kilometers\nlong -- and that's already crazy --\n\n00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:48.265\nthey would have to measure\nthe length of those detectors\n\n00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:53.017\nto less than one thousandth\nof the radius of the nucleus\n\n00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:54.199\nof an atom.\n\n00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:56.063\nAnd that's preposterous.\n\n00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:59.582\nSo towards the end\nof his classic text on gravity,\n\n00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:03.228\nLIGO co-founder Kip Thorne\n\n00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:07.453\ndescribed the hunt\nfor gravitational waves as follows:\n\n00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:10.628\nHe said, \"The technical difficulties\nto be surmounted\n\n00:05:10.652 --> 00:05:12.965\nin constructing such detectors\n\n00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:14.254\nare enormous.\n\n00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:17.604\nBut physicists are ingenious,\n\n00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:21.366\nand with the support\nof a broad lay public,\n\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.905\nall obstacles will surely be overcome.\"\n\n00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:29.616\nThorne published that in 1973,\n\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.964\n42 years before he succeeded.\n\n00:05:35.107 --> 00:05:36.366\nNow, coming back to LIGO,\n\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.604\nScott likes to say that LIGO\nacts like an ear\n\n00:05:39.628 --> 00:05:41.206\nmore than it does like an eye.\n\n00:05:41.587 --> 00:05:43.797\nI want to explain what that means.\n\n00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:46.143\nVisible light has a wavelength, a size,\n\n00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:48.740\nthat's much smaller\nthan the things around you,\n\n00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:50.263\nthe features on people's faces,\n\n00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:53.040\nthe size of your cell phone.\n\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.747\nAnd that's really useful,\n\n00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.978\nbecause it lets you make an image\nor a map of the things around you,\n\n00:05:58.002 --> 00:06:00.390\nby looking at the light\ncoming from different spots\n\n00:06:00.414 --> 00:06:01.565\nin the scene about you.\n\n00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.532\nSound is different.\n\n00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.519\nAudible sound has a wavelength\nthat can be up to 50 feet long.\n\n00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:09.320\nAnd that makes it really difficult --\n\n00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:12.384\nin fact, in practical purposes,\nimpossible -- to make an image\n\n00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:14.226\nof something you really care about.\n\n00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.590\nYour child's face.\n\n00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:20.865\nInstead, we use sound\nto listen for features like pitch\n\n00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.007\nand tone and rhythm and volume\n\n00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:27.404\nto infer a story behind the sounds.\n\n00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:29.877\nThat's Alice talking.\n\n00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:31.434\nThat's Bob interrupting.\n\n00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:32.708\nSilly Bob.\n\n00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:36.812\nSo, the same is true\nof gravitational waves.\n\n00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:42.710\nWe can't use them to make simple images\nof things out in the Universe.\n\n00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:44.410\nBut by listening to changes\n\n00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:47.877\nin the amplitude and frequency\nof those waves,\n\n00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.960\nwe can hear the story\nthat those waves are telling.\n\n00:06:52.182 --> 00:06:53.723\nAnd at least for LIGO,\n\n00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.945\nthe frequencies that it can hear\nare in the audio band.\n\n00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:02.521\nSo if we convert the wave patterns\ninto pressure waves and air, into sound,\n\n00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:05.857\nwe can literally hear\nthe Universe speaking to us.\n\n00:07:07.047 --> 00:07:11.178\nFor example, listening to gravity,\njust in this way,\n\n00:07:11.202 --> 00:07:13.892\ncan tell us a lot about the collision\nof two black holes,\n\n00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:17.710\nsomething my colleague Scott has spent\nan awful lot of time thinking about.\n\n00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:20.205\n(Audio) SH: If the two black holes\nare non-spinning,\n\n00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:21.974\nyou get a very simple chirp: whoop!\n\n00:07:22.427 --> 00:07:26.080\nIf the two bodies are spinning\nvery rapidly, I have that same chirp,\n\n00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:27.826\nbut with a modulation on top of it,\n\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.215\nso it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!\n\n00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:34.790\nIt's sort of the vocabulary of spin\nimprinted on this waveform.\n\n00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:38.458\nAA: So on September 14, 2015,\n\n00:07:38.482 --> 00:07:41.408\na date that's definitely\ngoing to live in my memory,\n\n00:07:41.432 --> 00:07:43.677\nLIGO heard this:\n\n00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:45.231\n[Whirring sound]\n\n00:07:46.374 --> 00:07:51.254\nSo if you know how to listen,\nthat is the sound of --\n\n00:07:51.278 --> 00:07:54.492\n(Audio) SH: ... two black holes,\neach of about 30 solar masses,\n\n00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.208\nthat were whirling around at a rate\n\n00:07:56.232 --> 00:07:58.773\ncomparable to what goes on\nin your blender.\n\n00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:02.091\nAA: It's worth pausing here\nto think about what that means.\n\n00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:05.400\nTwo black holes, the densest thing\nin the Universe,\n\n00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:07.604\none with a mass of 29 Suns\n\n00:08:07.628 --> 00:08:10.415\nand one with a mass of 36 Suns,\n\n00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:13.112\nwhirling around each other\n100 times per second\n\n00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:14.294\nbefore they collide.\n\n00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:16.031\nJust imagine the power of that.\n\n00:08:16.777 --> 00:08:18.015\nIt's fantastic.\n\n00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.880\nAnd we know it because we heard it.\n\n00:08:23.785 --> 00:08:26.165\nThat's the lasting importance of LIGO.\n\n00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:30.716\nIt's an entirely new way\nto observe the Universe\n\n00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.597\nthat we've never had before.\n\n00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.685\nIt's a way that lets us hear the Universe\n\n00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.319\nand hear the invisible.\n\n00:08:39.454 --> 00:08:41.752\nAnd there's a lot out there\nthat we can't see --\n\n00:08:42.514 --> 00:08:44.142\nin practice or even in principle.\n\n00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:46.175\nSo supernova, for example:\n\n00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:50.643\nI would love to know why very massive\nstars explode in supernovae.\n\n00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:51.818\nThey're very useful;\n\n00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:54.186\nwe've learned a lot\nabout the Universe from them.\n\n00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.217\nThe problem is, all the interesting\nphysics happens in the core,\n\n00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.746\nand the core is hidden behind\nthousands of kilometers\n\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.845\nof iron and carbon and silicon.\n\n00:09:01.869 --> 00:09:04.174\nWe'll never see through it,\nit's opaque to light.\n\n00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:08.114\nGravitational waves go through iron\nas if it were glass --\n\n00:09:08.138 --> 00:09:09.593\ntotally transparent.\n\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.867\nThe Big Bang: I would love\nto be able to explore\n\n00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:15.730\nthe first few moments of the Universe,\n\n00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:17.402\nbut we'll never see them,\n\n00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:21.732\nbecause the Big Bang itself\nis obscured by its own afterglow.\n\n00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:24.280\nWith gravitational waves,\n\n00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:27.788\nwe should be able to see\nall the way back to the beginning.\n\n00:09:28.383 --> 00:09:30.177\nPerhaps most importantly,\n\n00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:32.639\nI'm positive that there\nare things out there\n\n00:09:33.258 --> 00:09:34.849\nthat we've never seen\n\n00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:36.626\nthat we may never be able to see\n\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.491\nand that we haven't even imagined --\n\n00:09:39.927 --> 00:09:42.316\nthings that we'll only\ndiscover by listening.\n\n00:09:43.213 --> 00:09:45.873\nAnd in fact, even\nin that very first event,\n\n00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:48.943\nLIGO found things that we didn't expect.\n\n00:09:49.522

the future", "duration": "695", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/raffaello_d_andrea_meet_the_dazzling_flying_machines_of_the_future", "transcript": "What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry. Inspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones, and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world.For example, before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France, and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes. By tethering flying machines, they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces. They can also autonomously build tensile structures. Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact with the physical world.Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on. Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight.Now, for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space. Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks. For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab. There are no external cameras. Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be. The only external commands are high-level ones such as \"take off\" and \"land.\"This is a so-called tail-sitter. It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it. Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters and variations thereof. Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing and general versatility. There is no free lunch, unfortunately. One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts. We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation. The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice, improve its performance over time.(Applause)OK.When doing research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter. For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight? Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question. Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm. It turns out that decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder. We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.This is the monospinner, the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine, invented just a few months ago. It has only one moving part, a propeller. It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons, no other actuators, no other control surfaces, just a simple propeller. Even though it's mechanically simple, there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space. Even so, it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter, which means that in order to get it to fly, I have to throw it just right. And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night.(Laughter)(Applause)If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers, is an exercise in excess. What can you do with all this surplus? The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric. As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation. This gives it an extraordinary capability. It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating. It has its own complexities, mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers. Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly. Let's take a look.(Applause)If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives, they will need to become extremely safe and reliable. This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines. This one wants to spin clockwise. This other one wants to spin counterclockwise. When you put them together, they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter. If anything goes wrong, however \u2014 a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack \u2014 the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion. We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.(Applause)This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms. The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression. We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters, each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms. Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number.(Applause)(Applause)(Applause)Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines. That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.(Laughter)The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology. And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation. It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is, that it allows creative, clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways. The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2440, "subtitle":

"https://www.ted.com/talks/al_gore_the_case_for_optimism_on_climate_change", "transcript": "I was excited to be a part of the \"Dream\" theme, and then I found out I'm leading off the \"Nightmare?\" section of it.(Laughter)And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify. And I have some bad news, but I have a lot more good news. I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news. But \u2014 hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive.So the first question is, \"Do we really have to change?\" And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things changed the environmental movement, really launched the modern environmental movement. 18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth, the first Earth Day was organized. And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space. And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us. One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky. As this picture illustrates, the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground. It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet. That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized. We are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours, free of charge, go ahead.And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases, I'm certainly not going to go through them all. I'm going to focus on the main one, but agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved. Management of forests, transportation, the oceans, the melting of the permafrost. But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem, which is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year. And you can see from this image that after World War II, the emission rates started really accelerating. And the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours, 365 days a year. Fact-checked over and over again, conservative, it's the truth. Now it's a big planet, but \u2014(Explosion sound)that is a lot of energy, particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day. And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.Let's look at the atmosphere. This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures. The white represents normal temperature days; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen. The blue are cooler than average days, the red are warmer than average days. But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s. And you'll see in the lower right-hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days. In the 90s, the curve shifted further. And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days. In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago.So we're having record-breaking temperatures. Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century. The hottest of all was last year. Last month was the 371st month in a row warmer than the 20th-century average. And for the first time, not only the warmest January, but for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average. These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals, plants, people, ecosystems.But on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans. And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths: deep, mid-ocean, the first few hundred meters. And this, too, is accelerating. It goes back more than a century. And more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years. This has consequences.The first order of consequence: the ocean-based storms get stronger. Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban, as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall. Pope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue, visited Tacloban right after that. Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey. The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now. The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies. Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent. And it creates these atmospheric rivers. The Brazilian scientists call them \"flying rivers.\" And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours. This is from Montana. Take a look at this storm last August. As it moves over Tucson, Arizona. It literally splashes off the city. These downpours are really unusual.Last July in Houston, Texas, it rained for two days, 162 billion gallons. That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city, which was, of course, paralyzed. These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.This one is from Chile last year. And you'll see that warehouse going by. There are oil tankers cars going by. This is from Spain last September, you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess. Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.(Laughter)I mean, really.The insurance industry has certainly noticed, the losses have been mounting up. They're not under any illusions about what's happening. And the causality requires a moment of discussion. We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect \u2014 one cause, one effect. This is systemic causation. As the great Kevin Trenberth says, \"All storms are different now. There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor. Every storm is different now.\" So, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now.It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America. There's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.More lightning, as the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also.These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability. The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006 destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria, killed 80 percent of the livestock, and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria, where they collided with another 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War. And along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now. The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis, including refugees, food and water shortages and pandemic disease.Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes; the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this. But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them. The Zika epidemic now \u2014 we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system. But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years \u2014 that's something new, that ought to get our attention. The Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world, last summer labeled this a medical emergency now. And there are many factors because of it.This is also connected to the extinction crisis. We're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century. And already, land-based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of 15 feet per day.Speaking of the North Pole, last December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest, raised temperatures at the North Pole 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night. And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts, it raises sea level.Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this. It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly, Antarctica. The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia. When you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami: three and a half trillion dollars at risk. Number three: New York and Newark. I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon, one of the highest high-tide days. And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey. And this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now. Not with rain \u2014 they call it \"sunny-day flooding.\" It comes up through the storm sewers. And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens. This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day. We have to move beyond partisanship.And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans \u2014(Applause)who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk, by telling the truth about the climate crisis.So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up, there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned. It's an enormous burden. I'll mention just one more, because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, after their annual survey of 750 economists, said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy. So you get central bankers like Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank, saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable. Subprime carbon. I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages, but it's the same thing. If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution, this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years. Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books, 28 trillion dollars. The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned. So the rest, 22 trillion dollars \u2014 unburnable. Risk to the global economy. That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative.So the answer to the first question, \"Must we change?\" is yes, we have to change. Second question, \"Can we change?\" This is the exciting news! The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010, the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity. We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over. We see an exponential curve for wind installations now. We see the cost coming down dramatically. Some countries \u2014 take Germany, an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way \u2014 one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind. A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.More good news: energy storage, from batteries particularly, is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem. With solar, the news is even more exciting! The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010. When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over. Last year, we beat it by 58 times over. This year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.We're going to win this. We are going to prevail. The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic. When I came to this stage 10 years ago, this is where it was. We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves.(Applause)And the cost has come down 10 percent per year for 30 years. And it's continuing to come down.Now, the business community has certainly noticed this, because it's crossing the grid parity point. Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise. Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold, below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. That threshold is a little bit like the difference between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero and one Celsius. It's a difference of more than one degree, it's the difference between ice and water. And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up, and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment. This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world, and two-thirds of it is in the private sector. We are seeing an explosion of new investment. Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils. The gap has been growing ever since. The projections for the future are even more dramatic, even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables. And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically.So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology? Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones. In 1980, AT&T, then Ma Bell, commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then. \"How many can we sell by the year 2000?\" they asked. McKinsey came back and said, \"900,000.\" And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000 \u2014 in the first three days. And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more. And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong? I've asked that question myself, \"Why?\"(Laughter)And I think the answer is in three parts. First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected, even as the quality went up. And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid \u2014 they leap-frogged to the new technology. The big expansion has been in the developing counties. So what about the electricity grids in the developing world? Well, not so hot. And in many areas, they don't exist. There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America. So now we're getting this: solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable. Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit. This is a village market. Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world: two systems per minute on average, night and day. And we have all we need: enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year. It's actually a little bit less than an hour. So the answer to the second question, \"Can we change?\" is clearly \"Yes.\" And it's an ever-firmer \"yes.\"Last question, \"Will we change?\" Paris really was a breakthrough, some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot. But nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead. China has already announced that starting next year, they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system. They will likely link up with the European Union. The United States has already been changing. All of these coal plants were proposed in the next 10 years and canceled. All of these existing coal plants were retired. All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced. All of them \u2014 canceled. We are moving forward. Last year \u2014 if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States, almost three-quarters was from renewable energy, mostly wind and solar.We are solving this crisis. The only question is: how long will it take to get there? So, it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change. Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this. Many thousands, tens of thousands, marched in cities around the world. And so, I am extremely optimistic. As I said before, we are going to win this.I'll finish with this story. When I was 13 years old, I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely in 10 years. And I heard adults of that day and time say, \"That's reckless, expensive, may well fail.\" But eight years and two months later, in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston. Here's a little-known fact about that: the average age of the systems engineers, the controllers in the room that day, was 26, which means, among other things, their age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced. One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US, Wallace Stevens, wrote a line that has stayed with me: \"After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,' and on that 'yes', the future world depends.\" When the abolitionists started their movement, they met with no after no after no. And then came a yes. The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's, until finally, there was a yes. The Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid, and more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere. After the final \"no\" comes a \"yes.\"When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong, the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings. Ninety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this. We have everything we need. Some still doubt that we have the will to act, but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible combination of skills. You've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues, and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language. No one else can do that, that's why you led this thing. It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now.Al Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris. But honestly, I have a lot of really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it into simple enough language that I can understand it. And that's the key to trying to communicate.CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying, second part: incredibly hopeful. How do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough to solve what you showed in the first part?AG: I think that the crossing \u2014 you know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years. But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent, or cheaper than. Turns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than.(Laughter)And when it crosses that line, then a lot of things really change. We are regularly surprised by these developments. The late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said, \"Things take longer to happen then you think they will, and then they happen much faster than you thought they could.\" I really think that's where we are. Some people are using the phrase \"The Solar Singularity\" now, meaning when it gets below the grid parity, unsubsidized in most places, then it's the default choice.Now, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing, there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down. And I just don't think it's going to work.There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party. They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations. And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request.(Laughter)And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party.(Laughter)(Applause)And they defeated the proposal. So, finally, the answer to your question is, this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a clich\u00e9, but 10 years ago \u2014 and Christiana referred to this \u2014 there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves. And it didn't work out economically for some of them, but it kick-started this global revolution. And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this. But it matters a lot how fast we win it.CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful. If this turns out to be the year, that the partisan thing changes, as you said, it's no longer a partisan issue, but you bring along people from the other side together, backed by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities, backed by reason that you win the day \u2014 boy, that's really exciting.Thank you so much.AG: Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED.

again,\n\n00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:56.491\nconservative, it's the truth.\n\n00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:58.611\nNow it's a big planet, but --\n\n00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.090\n(Explosion sound)\n\n00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.737\nthat is a lot of energy,\n\n00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:08.164\nparticularly when you multiply it\n400,000 times per day.\n\n00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.348\nAnd all that extra heat energy\n\n00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:13.348\nis heating up the atmosphere,\nthe whole earth system.\n\n00:03:13.372 --> 00:03:15.322\nLet's look at the atmosphere.\n\n00:03:15.346 --> 00:03:16.636\nThis is a depiction\n\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.125\nof what we used to think of as\nthe normal distribution of temperatures.\n\n00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:25.236\nThe white represents\nnormal temperature days;\n\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.301\n1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.\n\n00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:30.205\nThe blue are cooler than average days,\n\n00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.480\nthe red are warmer than average days.\n\n00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:36.662\nBut the entire curve has moved\nto the right in the 1980s.\n\n00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:38.837\nAnd you'll see\nin the lower right-hand corner\n\n00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.304\nthe appearance of statistically\nsignificant numbers\n\n00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:42.906\nof extremely hot days.\n\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.903\nIn the 90s, the curve shifted further.\n\n00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:48.618\nAnd in the last 10 years,\nyou see the extremely hot days\n\n00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:52.309\nare now more numerous\nthan the cooler than average days.\n\n00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:57.789\nIn fact, they are 150 times more common\non the surface of the earth\n\n00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:01.194\nthan they were just 30 years ago.\n\n00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:04.741\nSo we're having\nrecord-breaking temperatures.\n\n00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:08.088\nFourteen of the 15 of the hottest years\never measured with instruments\n\n00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:09.651\nhave been in this young century.\n\n00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:12.208\nThe hottest of all was last year.\n\n00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:15.729\nLast month was the 371st month in a row\n\n00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.920\nwarmer than the 20th-century average.\n\n00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:21.124\nAnd for the first time,\nnot only the warmest January,\n\n00:04:21.148 --> 00:04:26.209\nbut for the first time, it was more\nthan two degrees Fahrenheit warmer\n\n00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.315\nthan the average.\n\n00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:32.243\nThese higher temperatures\nare having an effect on animals,\n\n00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:35.330\nplants, people, ecosystems.\n\n00:04:35.354 --> 00:04:40.276\nBut on a global basis, 93 percent\nof all the extra heat energy\n\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.716\nis trapped in the oceans.\n\n00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:44.281\nAnd the scientists can measure\nthe heat buildup\n\n00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:45.574\nmuch more precisely now\n\n00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:47.829\nat all depths: deep, mid-ocean,\n\n00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:49.893\nthe first few hundred meters.\n\n00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:52.512\nAnd this, too, is accelerating.\n\n00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:54.165\nIt goes back more than a century.\n\n00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.576\nAnd more than half of the increase\nhas been in the last 19 years.\n\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.923\nThis has consequences.\n\n00:04:59.947 --> 00:05:01.490\nThe first order of consequence:\n\n00:05:01.514 --> 00:05:03.468\nthe ocean-based storms get stronger.\n\n00:05:03.492 --> 00:05:05.944\nSuper Typhoon Haiyan\nwent over areas of the Pacific\n\n00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:09.287\nfive and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nwarmer than normal\n\n00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:11.804\nbefore it slammed into Tacloban,\n\n00:05:11.828 --> 00:05:15.851\nas the most destructive storm\never to make landfall.\n\n00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:20.495\nPope Francis, who has made\nsuch a difference to this whole issue,\n\n00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:22.824\nvisited Tacloban right after that.\n\n00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:25.427\nSuperstorm Sandy went over\nareas of the Atlantic\n\n00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:27.809\nnine degrees warmer than normal\n\n00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:30.720\nbefore slamming into\nNew York and New Jersey.\n\n00:05:31.912 --> 00:05:35.080\nThe second order of consequences\nare affecting all of us right now.\n\n00:05:35.104 --> 00:05:40.835\nThe warmer oceans are evaporating\nmuch more water vapor into the skies.\n\n00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:44.689\nAverage humidity worldwide\nhas gone up four percent.\n\n00:05:44.713 --> 00:05:47.406\nAnd it creates these atmospheric rivers.\n\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.448\nThe Brazilian scientists\ncall them \"flying rivers.\"\n\n00:05:50.472 --> 00:05:55.215\nAnd they funnel all of that\nextra water vapor over the land\n\n00:05:55.239 --> 00:06:00.501\nwhere storm conditions trigger\nthese massive record-breaking downpours.\n\n00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:03.265\nThis is from Montana.\n\n00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.612\nTake a look at this storm last August.\n\n00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:07.955\nAs it moves over Tucson, Arizona.\n\n00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.763\nIt literally splashes off the city.\n\n00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:14.990\nThese downpours are really unusual.\n\n00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:18.165\nLast July in Houston, Texas,\n\n00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.143\nit rained for two days,\n162 billion gallons.\n\n00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:25.230\nThat represents more than two days\nof the full flow of Niagara Falls\n\n00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:26.499\nin the middle of the city,\n\n00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:28.426\nwhich was, of course, paralyzed.\n\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.798\nThese record downpours are creating\nhistoric floods and mudslides.\n\n00:06:32.822 --> 00:06:36.236\nThis one is from Chile last year.\n\n00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:40.276\nAnd you'll see that warehouse going by.\n\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.904\nThere are oil tankers cars going by.\n\n00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:44.864\nThis is from Spain last September,\n\n00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:48.982\nyou could call this the running\nof the cars and trucks, I guess.\n\n00:06:49.823 --> 00:06:52.651\nEvery night on the TV news now\nis like a nature hike\n\n00:06:52.675 --> 00:06:54.206\nthrough the Book of Revelation.\n\n00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.924\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:56.948 --> 00:06:58.309\nI mean, really.\n\n00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:01.660\nThe insurance industry\nhas certainly noticed,\n\n00:07:01.684 --> 00:07:03.904\nthe losses have been mounting up.\n\n00:07:03.928 --> 00:07:07.526\nThey're not under any illusions\nabout what's happening.\n\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.200\nAnd the causality requires\na moment of discussion.\n\n00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.538\nWe're used to thinking of linear cause\nand linear effect --\n\n00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:17.713\none cause, one effect.\n\n00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.539\nThis is systemic causation.\n\n00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:23.206\nAs the great Kevin Trenberth says,\n\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.690\n\"All storms are different now.\n\n00:07:24.714 --> 00:07:26.953\nThere's so much extra energy\nin the atmosphere,\n\n00:07:26.977 --> 00:07:28.642\nthere's so much extra water vapor.\n\n00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:31.659\nEvery storm is different now.\"\n\n00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:36.024\nSo, the same extra heat pulls\nthe soil moisture out of the ground\n\n00:07:36.048 --> 00:07:40.458\nand causes these deeper, longer,\nmore pervasive droughts\n\n00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:42.572\nand many of them are underway right now.\n\n00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.110\nIt dries out the vegetation\n\n00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:47.796\nand causes more fires\nin the western part of North America.\n\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.279\nThere's certainly been evidence\nof that, a lot of them.\n\n00:07:51.303 --> 00:07:52.454\nMore lightning,\n\n00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:55.260\nas the heat energy builds up,\nthere's a considerable amount\n\n00:07:55.284 --> 00:07:58.104\nof additional lightning also.\n\n00:07:58.668 --> 00:08:05.536\nThese climate-related disasters also have\ngeopolitical consequences\n\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.370\nand create instability.\n\n00:08:07.394 --> 00:08:12.670\nThe climate-related historic drought\nthat started in Syria in 2006\n\n00:08:12.694 --> 00:08:15.646\ndestroyed 60 percent\nof the farms in Syria,\n\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.011\nkilled 80 percent of the livestock,\n\n00:08:18.035 --> 00:08:22.254\nand drove 1.5 million climate refugees\ninto the cities of Syria,\n\n00:08:22.278 --> 00:08:25.507\nwhere they collided with another\n1.5 million refugees\n\n00:08:25.531 --> 00:08:27.547\nfrom the Iraq War.\n\n00:08:27.943 --> 00:08:32.168\nAnd along with other factors,\nthat opened the gates of Hell\n\n00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:35.372\nthat people are trying to close now.\n\n00:08:35.396 --> 00:08:37.810\nThe US Defense Department has long warned\n\n00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:40.132\nof consequences from the climate crisis,\n\n00:08:40.156 --> 00:08:44.683\nincluding refugees,\nfood and water shortages\n\n00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:46.587\nand pandemic disease.\n\n00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:51.340\nRight now we're seeing microbial diseases\nfrom the tropics spread\n\n00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.624\nto the higher latitudes;\n\n00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:56.266\nthe transportation revolution has had\na lot to do with this.\n\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.955\nBut the changing conditions\nchange the latitudes and the areas\n\n00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:03.812\nwhere these microbial diseases\ncan become endemic\n\n00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:08.575\nand change the range of the vectors,\nlike mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.\n\n00:09:08.599 --> 00:09:12.067\nThe Zika epidemic now --\n\n00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:14.008\nwe're better positioned in North America\n\n00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:18.722\nbecause it's still a little too cool\nand we have a better public health system.\n\n00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:23.046\nBut when women in some regions\nof South and Central America\n\n00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.781\nare advised not to get pregnant\nfor two years --\n\n00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:29.078\nthat's something new,\nthat ought to get our attention.\n\n00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:33.067\nThe Lancet, one of the two greatest\nmedical journals in the world,\n\n00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:37.321\nlast summer labeled this\na medical emergency now.\n\n00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:40.007\nAnd there are many factors because of it.\n\n00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:42.828\nThis is also connected\nto the extinction crisis.\n\n00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:46.399\nWe're in danger of losing 50 percent\nof all the living species on earth\n\n00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:47.746\nby the end of this century.\n\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.532\nAnd already, land-based plants and animals\n\n00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.204\nare now moving towards the poles\n\n00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:55.611\nat an average rate of 15 feet per day.\n\n00:09:56.619 --> 00:09:57.929\nSpeaking of the North Pole,\n\n00:09:57.953 --> 00:10:03.223\nlast December 29, the same storm\nthat caused historic flooding\n\n00:10:03.247 --> 00:10:04.896\nin the American Midwest,\n\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.103\nraised temperatures at the North Pole\n\n00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:09.757\n50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,\n\n00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.219\ncausing the thawing of the North Pole\n\n00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:16.855\nin the middle of the long,\ndark, winter, polar night.\n\n00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:20.461\nAnd when the land-based ice\nof the Arctic melts,\n\n00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:22.203\nit raises sea level.\n\n00:10:22.227 --> 00:10:25.972\nPaul Nicklen's beautiful photograph\nfrom Svalbard illustrates this.\n\n00:10:26.432 --> 00:10:28.392\nIt's more dangerous coming off Greenland\n\n00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:30.422\nand particularly, Antarctica.\n\n00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:35.136\nThe 10 largest risk cities\nfor sea-level rise by population\n\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.899\nare mostly in South and Southeast Asia.\n\n00:10:37.923 --> 00:10:42.032\nWhen you measure it by assets at risk,\nnumber one is Miami:\n\n00:10:42.056 --> 00:10:44.679\nthree and a half trillion dollars at risk.\n\n00:10:44.703 --> 00:10:46.374\nNumber three: New York and Newark.\n\n00:10:46.398 --> 00:10:49.694\nI was in Miami last fall\nduring the supermoon,\n\n00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:52.829\none of the highest high-tide days.\n\n00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:55.985\nAnd there were fish from the ocean\nswimming in some of the streets\n\n00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:58.160\nof Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale\n\n00:10:58.184 --> 00:10:59.358\nand Del Rey.\n\n00:10:59.382 --> 00:11:02.356\nAnd this happens regularly\nduring the highest-tide tides now.\n\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.995\nNot with rain -- they call it\n\"sunny-day flooding.\"\n\n00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:09.570\nIt comes up through the storm sewers.\n\n00:11:09.594 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd the Mayor of Miami\nspeaks for many when he says\n\n00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:18.205\nit is long past time this can be viewed\nthrough a partisan lens.\n\n00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:21.365\nThis is a crisis\nthat's getting worse day by day.\n\n00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.710\nWe have to move beyond partisanship.\n\n00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:26.996\nAnd I want to take a moment\nto honor these House Republicans --\n\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.074\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:28.098 --> 00:11:30.931\nwho had the courage last fall\n\n00:11:30.955 --> 00:11:35.389\nto step out and take a political risk,\n\n00:11:35.413 --> 00:11:38.152\nby telling the truth\nabout the climate crisis.\n\n00:11:38.176 --> 00:11:41.333\nSo the cost of the climate\ncrisis is mounting up,\n\n00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:45.025\nthere are many of these aspects\nI haven't even mentioned.\n\n00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:47.022\nIt's an enormous burden.\n\n00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:48.610\nI'll mention just one more,\n\n00:11:48.634 --> 00:11:53.361\nbecause the World Economic Forum\nlast month in Davos,\n\n00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:56.402\nafter their annual survey\nof 750 economists,\n\n00:11:56.426 --> 00:11:59.286\nsaid the climate crisis is now\nthe number one risk\n\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.139\nto the global economy.\n\n00:12:01.163 --> 00:12:02.481\nSo you get central bankers\n\n00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:05.275\nlike Mark Carney, the head\nof the UK Central Bank,\n\n00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:09.335\nsaying the vast majority\nof the carbon reserves are unburnable.\n\n00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:11.105\nSubprime carbon.\n\n00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:14.420\nI'm not going to remind you what happened\nwith subprime mortgages,\n\n00:12:14.444 --> 00:12:16.046\nbut it's the same thing.\n\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.785\nIf you look at all of the carbon fuels\nthat were burned\n\n00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:21.479\nsince the beginning\nof the industrial revolution,\n\n00:12:21.503 --> 00:12:25.019\nthis is the quantity burned\nin the last 16 years.\n\n00:12:25.043 --> 00:12:28.622\nHere are all the ones that are proven\nand left on the books,\n\n00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:30.434\n28 trillion dollars.\n\n00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:34.667\nThe International Energy Agency\nsays only this amount can be burned.\n\n00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.580\nSo the rest, 22 trillion dollars --\n\n00:12:37.604 --> 00:12:38.801\nunburnable.\n\n00:12:39.261 --> 00:12:41.494\nRisk to the global economy.\n\n00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:44.555\nThat's why divestment movement\nmakes practical sense\n\n00:12:44.579 --> 00:12:47.159\nand is not just a moral imperative.\n\n00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:51.353\nSo the answer to the first question,\n\"Must we change?\"\n\n00:12:51.377 --> 00:12:53.301\nis yes, we have to change.\n\n00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:55.077\nSecond question, \"Can we change?\"\n\n00:12:55.101 --> 00:12:57.422\nThis is the exciting news!\n\n00:12:57.446 --> 00:13:00.951\nThe best projections\nin the world 16 years ago\n\n00:13:00.975 --> 00:13:05.006\nwere that by 2010, the world\nwould be able to install\n\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.197\n30 gigawatts of wind capacity.\n\n00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:12.212\nWe beat that mark\nby 14 and a half times over.\n\n00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:16.020\nWe see an exponential curve\nfor wind installations now.\n\n00:13:16.044 --> 00:13:19.619\nWe see the cost coming down dramatically.\n\n00:13:19.643 --> 00:13:22.893\nSome countries -- take Germany,\nan industrial powerhouse\n\n00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:26.285\nwith a climate not that different\nfrom Vancouver's, by the way --\n\n00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:27.944\none day last December,\n\n00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:31.406\ngot 81 percent of all its energy\nfrom renewable resources,\n\n00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.063\nmainly solar and wind.\n\n00:13:33.087 --> 00:13:36.388\nA lot of countries are getting\nmore than half on an average basis.\n\n00:13:36.412 --> 00:13:37.570\nMore good news:\n\n00:13:37.594 --> 00:13:40.617\nenergy storage,\nfrom batteries particularly,\n\n00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:42.235\nis now beginning to take off\n\n00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:46.052\nbecause the cost has been\ncoming down very dramatically\n\n00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.849\nto solve the intermittency problem.\n\n00:13:47.873 --> 00:13:50.384\nWith solar, the news is even\nmore exciting!\n\n00:13:50.408 --> 00:13:53.757\nThe best projections 14 years ago\nwere that we would install\n\n00:13:53.781 --> 00:13:56.328\none gigawatt per year by 2010.\n\n00:13:56.352 --> 00:14:00.972\nWhen 2010 came around,\nwe beat that mark by 17 times over.\n\n00:14:00.996 --> 00:14:04.581\nLast year, we beat it by 58 times over.\n\n00:14:04.605 --> 00:14:07.845\nThis year, we're on track\nto beat it 68 times over.\n\n00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:09.059\nWe're going to win this.\n\n00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:10.817\nWe are going to prevail.\n\n00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:14.924\nThe exponential curve on solar\nis even steeper and more dramatic.\n\n00:14:14.948 --> 00:14:16.877\nWhen I came to this stage 10 years ago,\n\n00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:18.296\nthis is where it was.\n\n00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:22.406\nWe have seen a revolutionary breakthrough\n\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.619\nin the emergence\nof these exponential curves.\n\n00:14:25.643 --> 00:14:28.867\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:32.388\nAnd the cost has come down\n10 percent per year\n\n00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:33.711\nfor 30 years.\n\n00:14:33.735 --> 00:14:36.033\nAnd it's continuing to come down.\n\n00:14:36.057 --> 00:14:38.703\nNow, the business community\nhas certainly noticed this,\n\n00:14:38.727 --> 00:14:41.536\nbecause it's crossing\nthe grid parity point.\n\n00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.812\nCheaper solar penetration rates\nare beginning to rise.\n\n00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:48.352\nGrid parity is understood\nas that line, that threshold,\n\n00:14:48.376 --> 00:14:52.250\nbelow which renewable electricity\nis cheaper than electricity\n\n00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:54.492\nfrom burning fossil fuels.\n\n00:14:54.516 --> 00:14:57.209\nThat threshold is a little bit\nlike the difference\n\n00:14:57.233 --> 00:15:01.343\nbetween 32 degrees Fahrenheit\nand 33 degrees Fahrenheit,\n\n00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.953\nor zero and one Celsius.\n\n00:15:02.977 --> 00:15:05.001\nIt's a difference of more than one degree,\n\n00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:07.726\nit's the difference between ice and water.\n\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.694\nAnd it's the difference between markets\nthat are frozen up,\n\n00:15:11.718 --> 00:15:16.250\nand liquid flows of capital\ninto new opportunities for investment.\n\n00:15:16.274 --> 00:15:19.879\nThis is the biggest\nnew business opportunity\n\n00:15:19.903 --> 00:15:21.435\nin the history of the world,\n\n00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:24.607\nand two-thirds of it\nis in the private sector.\n\n00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:28.067\nWe are seeing an explosion\nof new investment.\n\n00:15:28.091 --> 00:15:33.659\nStarting in 2010, investments globally\nin renewable electricity generation\n\n00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.216\nsurpassed fossils.\n\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.656\nThe gap has been growing ever since.\n\n00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.628\nThe projections for the future\nare even more dramatic,\n\n00:15:40.652 --> 00:15:44.251\neven though fossil energy\nis now still subsidized\n\n00:15:44.275 --> 00:15:47.502\nat a rate 40 times larger than renewables.\n\n00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:51.616\nAnd by the way, if you add\nthe projections for nuclear on here,\n\n00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.261\nparticularly if you assume\nthat the work many are doing\n\n00:15:54.285 --> 00:15:56.999\nto try to break through to safer\nand more acceptable,\n\n00:15:57.023 --> 00:15:58.862\nmore affordable forms of nuclear,\n\n00:15:58.886 --> 00:16:01.329\nthis could change even more dramatically.\n\n00:16:01.892 --> 00:16:04.848\nSo is there any precedent\nfor such a rapid adoption\n\n00:16:04.872 --> 00:16:06.601\nof a new technology?\n\n00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:09.085\nWell, there are many,\nbut let's look at cell phones.\n\n00:16:09.109 --> 00:16:12.482\nIn 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell,\n\n00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:14.899\ncommissioned McKinsey to do\na global market survey\n\n00:16:14.923 --> 00:16:18.539\nof those clunky new mobile phones\nthat appeared then.\n\n00:16:18.563 --> 00:16:21.726\n\"How many can we sell\nby the year 2000?\" they asked.\n\n00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.318\nMcKinsey came back and said, \"900,000.\"\n\n00:16:24.342 --> 00:16:26.414\nAnd sure enough,\nwhen the year 2000 arrived,\n\n00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:29.016\nthey did sell 900,000 --\nin the first three days.\n\n00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.952\nAnd for the balance of the year,\nthey sold 120 times more.\n\n00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:37.352\nAnd now there are more cell connections\nthan there are people in the world.\n\n00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:41.845\nSo, why were they not only wrong,\nbut way wrong?\n\n00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:44.269\nI've asked that question myself, \"Why?\"\n\n00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:45.296\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.553\nAnd I think the answer is in three parts.\n\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.469\nFirst, the cost came down much faster\nthan anybody expected,\n\n00:16:51.493 --> 00:16:54.000\neven as the quality went up.\n\n00:16:54.024 --> 00:16:58.296\nAnd low-income countries, places\nthat did not have a landline grid --\n\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.548\nthey leap-frogged to the new technology.\n\n00:17:00.572 --> 00:17:03.636\nThe big expansion has been\nin the developing counties.\n\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.408\nSo what about the electricity grids\nin the developing world?\n\n00:17:07.432 --> 00:17:09.162\nWell, not so hot.\n\n00:17:09.186 --> 00:17:11.484\nAnd in many areas, they don't exist.\n\n00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:14.654\nThere are more people\nwithout any electricity at all in India\n\n00:17:14.678 --> 00:17:17.800\nthan the entire population\nof the United States of America.\n\n00:17:17.824 --> 00:17:19.328\nSo now we're getting this:\n\n00:17:19.352 --> 00:17:21.190\nsolar panels on grass huts\n\n00:17:21.214 --> 00:17:24.152\nand new business models\nthat make it affordable.\n\n00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:29.061\nMuhammad Yunus financed\nthis one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.\n\n00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:30.793\nThis is a village market.\n\n00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:33.707\nBangladesh is now the fastest-deploying\ncountry in the world:\n\n00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:36.143\ntwo systems per minute\non average, night and day.\n\n00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:37.356\nAnd we have all we need:\n\n00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.672\nenough energy from the Sun\ncomes to the earth\n\n00:17:39.696 --> 00:17:45.059\nevery hour to supply the full world's\nenergy needs for an entire year.\n\n00:17:45.083 --> 00:17:47.256\nIt's actually a little bit\nless than an hour.\n\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.612\nSo the answer to the second question,\n\"Can we change?\"\n\n00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:52.559\nis clearly \"Yes.\"\n\n00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:55.355\nAnd it's an ever-firmer \"yes.\"\n\n00:17:55.379 --> 00:17:57.987\nLast question, \"Will we change?\"\n\n00:17:58.011 --> 00:18:00.003\nParis really was a breakthrough,\n\n00:18:00.027 --> 00:18:01.690\nsome of the provisions are binding\n\n00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:03.752\nand the regular reviews will matter a lot.\n\n00:18:03.776 --> 00:18:06.027\nBut nations aren't waiting,\nthey're going ahead.\n\n00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:08.566\nChina has already announced\nthat starting next year,\n\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.573\nthey're adopting a nationwide\ncap and trade system.\n\n00:18:11.597 --> 00:18:14.740\nThey will likely link up\nwith the European Union.\n\n00:18:14.764 --> 00:18:17.256\nThe United States\nhas already been changing.\n\n00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.330\nAll of these coal plants were proposed\n\n00:18:19.354 --> 00:18:21.884\nin the next 10 years and canceled.\n\n00:18:21.908 --> 00:18:24.827\nAll of these existing\ncoal plants were retired.\n\n00:18:24.851 --> 00:18:27.868\nAll of these coal plants have had\ntheir retirement announced.\n\n00:18:27.892 --> 00:18:30.220\nAll of them -- canceled.\n\n00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:31.734\nWe are moving forward.\n\n00:18:31.758 --> 00:18:34.226\nLast year -- if you look at\nall of the investment\n\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.193\nin new electricity generation\nin the United States,\n\n00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:39.883\nalmost three-quarters\nwas from renewable energy,\n\n00:18:39.907 --> 00:18:42.419\nmostly wind and solar.\n\n00:18:42.443 --> 00:18:45.590\nWe are solving this crisis.\n\n00:18:45.614 --> 00:18:50.513\nThe only question is:\nhow long will it take to get there?\n\n00:18:50.537 --> 00:18:55.154\nSo, it matters that a lot\nof people are organizing\n\n00:18:55.178 --> 00:18:57.316\nto insist on this change.\n\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.124\nAlmost 400,000 people\nmarched in New York City\n\n00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:03.995\nbefore the UN special session on this.\n\n00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.023\nMany thousands, tens of thousands,\n\n00:19:06.047 --> 00:19:08.920\nmarched in cities around the world.\n\n00:19:08.944 --> 00:19:13.087\nAnd so, I am extremely optimistic.\n\n00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.666\nAs I said before,\nwe are going to win this.\n\n00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.657\nI'll finish with this story.\n\n00:19:18.176 --> 00:19:20.768\nWhen I was 13 years old,\n\n00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:24.223\nI heard that proposal by President Kennedy\n\n00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.798\nto land a person on the Moon\nand bring him back safely\n\n00:19:26.822 --> 00:19:27.987\nin 10 years.\n\n00:19:28.011 --> 00:19:30.995\nAnd I heard adults\nof that day and time say,\n\n00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:34.536\n\"That's reckless, expensive,\nmay well fail.\"\n\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.737\nBut eight years and two months later,\n\n00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:40.023\nin the moment that Neil Armstrong\nset foot on the Moon,\n\n00:19:40.047 --> 00:19:44.637\nthere was great cheer that went up\nin NASA's mission control in Houston.\n\n00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.121\nHere's a little-known fact about that:\n\n00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:49.350\nthe average age of the systems engineers,\n\n00:19:49.374 --> 00:19:52.550\nthe controllers in the room\nthat day, was 26,\n\n00:19:52.574 --> 00:19:54.133\nwhich means, among other things,\n\n00:19:54.157 --> 00:19:57.407\ntheir age, when they heard\nthat challenge, was 18.\n\n00:19:57.431 --> 00:20:00.633\nWe now have a moral challenge\n\n00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:04.187\nthat is in the tradition of others\nthat we have faced.\n\n00:20:04.211 --> 00:20:07.865\nOne of the greatest poets\nof the last century in the US,\n\n00:20:07.889 --> 00:20:09.238\nWallace Stevens,\n\n00:20:09.262 --> 00:20:11.080\nwrote a line that has stayed with me:\n\n00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:13.587\n\"After the final 'no,'\nthere comes a 'yes,'\n\n00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:16.592\nand on that 'yes',\nthe future world depends.\"\n\n00:20:16.616 --> 00:20:18.901\nWhen the abolitionists\nstarted their movement,\n\n00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:21.132\nthey met with no after no after no.\n\n00:20:21.156 --> 00:20:22.432\nAnd then came a yes.\n\n00:20:22.456 --> 00:20:24.845\nThe Women's Suffrage\nand Women's Rights Movement\n\n00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:28.464\nmet endless no's, until finally,\nthere was a yes.\n\n00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:31.259\nThe Civil Rights Movement,\nthe movement against apartheid,\n\n00:20:31.283 --> 00:20:34.874\nand more recently, the movement\nfor gay and lesbian rights\n\n00:20:34.898 --> 00:20:37.303\nhere in the United States and elsewhere.\n\n00:20:37.327 --> 00:20:39.503\nAfter the final \"no\" comes a \"yes.\"\n\n00:20:39.527 --> 00:20:44.660\nWhen any great moral challenge\nis ultimately resolved\n\n00:20:44.684 --> 00:20:48.539\ninto a binary choice\nbetween what is right and what is wrong,\n\n00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:52.692\nthe outcome is fore-ordained\nbecause of who we are as human beings.\n\n00:20:52.716 --> 00:20:56.569\nNinety-nine percent of us,\nthat is where we are now\n\n00:20:56.593 --> 00:20:59.085\nand it is why we're going to win this.\n\n00:20:59.109 --> 00:21:01.047\nWe have everything we

A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true.(Laughter)If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.(Laughter)Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover \u2014 double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice.When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: \"Why are you oppressing yourself?\" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God \u2014 it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels.And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer.(Laughter)I later had a child, after getting married, and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.And then that terrible morning of September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen and see the words \"Breaking News.\" There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear,\"... Muslim terrorist ...,\" \"... in the name of Islam ...,\" \"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,\" \"... jihad ...,\" \"... we should bomb Mecca.\" Oh my God.Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect.That same day, we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school. And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world. And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like, \"Be alert,\" \"Be aware,\" \"Stay in well-lit areas,\" \"Don't congregate.\"I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims congregate for worship. And again the warnings were, \"Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target.\" And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home.And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough.Today we hear people actually saying things like, \"There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?\" So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques. They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is, are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether, and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people going to the mosque.Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.(Applause)Thank you.ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.(Applause)Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them, they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage \u2014 instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought?Well, one study \u2014 actually, several studies in neuroscience \u2014 show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen. We become more accepting of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation of a free society, which is rational and well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.(Applause)And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school, talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, \"When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?\" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.(Applause)I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.What will you choose? What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that?Thank you.(Applause)Thank you so much.Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people?Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims around the world \u2014 and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world \u2014 people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it.HW: Thank you so much.

An expert?\n\n00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:20.632\nMaybe even a sister.\n\n00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.636\nOr oppressed,\n\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.171\nbrainwashed,\n\n00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:26.583\na terrorist.\n\n00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.565\nOr just an airport security line delay.\n\n00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.038\nThat one's actually true.\n\n00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:35.618\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:38.865\nIf some of your perceptions were negative,\nI don't really blame you.\n\n00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:41.009\nThat's just how the media\nhas been portraying\n\n00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.563\npeople who look like me.\n\n00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:43.993\nOne study found\n\n00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:48.762\nthat 80 percent of news coverage\nabout Islam and Muslims is negative.\n\n00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:53.022\nAnd studies show that Americans\nsay that most don't know a Muslim.\n\n00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.902\nI guess people don't talk\nto their Uber drivers.\n\n00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:57.844\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:02.922\nWell, for those of you\nwho have never met a Muslim,\n\n00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:04.791\nit's great to meet you.\n\n00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:07.646\nLet me tell you who I am.\n\n00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.792\nI'm a mom, a coffee lover --\n\n00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:13.644\ndouble espresso, cream on the side.\n\n00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:15.400\nI'm an introvert.\n\n00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:18.054\nI'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.\n\n00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:22.420\nAnd I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.\n\n00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:28.095\nBut not like Lady Gaga says,\nbecause baby, I wasn't born this way.\n\n00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.445\nIt was a choice.\n\n00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:34.943\nWhen I was 17, I decided to come out.\n\n00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.798\nNo, not as a gay person\nlike some of my friends,\n\n00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:40.322\nbut as a Muslim,\n\n00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:43.417\nand decided to start wearing\nthe hijab, my head covering.\n\n00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:47.194\nMy feminist friends were aghast:\n\n00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.450\n\"Why are you oppressing yourself?\"\n\n00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:52.926\nThe funny thing was,\n\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.918\nit was actually at that time\na feminist declaration of independence\n\n00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:02.814\nfrom the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,\n\n00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:06.484\nto conform to a perfect\nand unattainable standard of beauty.\n\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.062\nI didn't just passively accept\nthe faith of my parents.\n\n00:02:12.616 --> 00:02:14.822\nI wrestled with the Quran.\n\n00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:19.774\nI read and reflected\nand questioned and doubted\n\n00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:22.007\nand, ultimately, believed.\n\n00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.826\nMy relationship with God --\nit was not love at first sight.\n\n00:02:29.572 --> 00:02:32.446\nIt was a trust and a slow surrender\n\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.483\nthat deepened with every\nreading of the Quran.\n\n00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.893\nIts rhythmic beauty\nsometimes moves me to tears.\n\n00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:44.062\nI see myself in it.\nI feel that God knows me.\n\n00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:50.619\nHave you ever felt like someone sees you,\ncompletely understands you\n\n00:02:50.643 --> 00:02:52.294\nand yet loves you anyway?\n\n00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.511\nThat's how it feels.\n\n00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.411\nAnd so later, I got married,\n\n00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:00.299\nand like all good Egyptians,\n\n00:03:00.323 --> 00:03:02.782\nstarted my career as an engineer.\n\n00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:04.806\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.402\nI later had a child,\nafter getting married,\n\n00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:15.139\nand I was living essentially\nthe Egyptian-American dream.\n\n00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:22.839\nAnd then that terrible morning\nof September, 2001.\n\n00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:29.321\nI think a lot of you probably remember\nexactly where you were that morning.\n\n00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.846\nI was sitting in my kitchen\nfinishing breakfast,\n\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.499\nand I look up on the screen\nand see the words \"Breaking News.\"\n\n00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:42.424\nThere was smoke,\nairplanes flying into buildings,\n\n00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:45.211\npeople jumping out of buildings.\n\n00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:46.898\nWhat was this?\n\n00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:48.768\nAn accident?\n\n00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:51.605\nA malfunction?\n\n00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:56.129\nMy shock quickly turned to outrage.\n\n00:03:56.508 --> 00:03:58.753\nWho would do this?\n\n00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:01.789\nAnd I switch the channel and I hear,\n\n00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.740\n\"...

So was I.\n\n00:06:04.855 --> 00:06:07.992\nAnd so to have to explain yourself\nall the time isn't easy.\n\n00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:13.031\nI don't mind questions. I love questions.\n\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.729\nIt's the accusations that are tough.\n\n00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:19.188\nToday we hear people actually\nsaying things like,\n\n00:06:20.236 --> 00:06:23.042\n\"There's a problem in this country,\nand it's called Muslims.\n\n00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:24.904\nWhen are we going to get rid of them?\"\n\n00:06:25.462 --> 00:06:28.674\nSo, some people want to ban Muslims\nand close down mosques.\n\n00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:32.213\nThey talk about my community\nkind of like we're a tumor\n\n00:06:32.237 --> 00:06:33.878\nin the body of America.\n\n00:06:33.902 --> 00:06:37.163\nAnd the only question is,\nare we malignant or benign?\n\n00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:40.805\nYou know, a malignant tumor\nyou extract altogether,\n\n00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:46.006\nand a benign tumor\nyou just keep under surveillance.\n\n00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:51.290\nThe choices don't make sense,\nbecause it's the wrong question.\n\n00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:55.752\nMuslims, like all other Americans,\naren't a tumor in the body of America,\n\n00:06:55.776 --> 00:06:57.251\nwe're a vital organ.\n\n00:06:58.067 --> 00:06:59.068\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:59.092 --> 00:07:00.251\nThank you.\n\n00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:03.495\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:05.895 --> 00:07:08.461\nMuslims are inventors and teachers,\n\n00:07:08.485 --> 00:07:11.523\nfirst responders and Olympic athletes.\n\n00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.699\nNow, is closing down mosques\ngoing to make America safer?\n\n00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:19.228\nIt might free up some parking spots,\n\n00:07:19.252 --> 00:07:20.895\nbut it will not end terrorism.\n\n00:07:22.092 --> 00:07:24.545\nGoing to a mosque regularly\nis actually linked\n\n00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:28.475\nto having more tolerant views\nof people of other faiths\n\n00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.521\nand greater civic engagement.\n\n00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:34.800\nAnd as one police chief\nin the Washington, DC area\n\n00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:35.975\nrecently told me,\n\n00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:38.859\npeople don't actually\nget radicalized at mosques.\n\n00:07:38.883 --> 00:07:42.975\nThey get radicalized in their basement\nor bedroom, in front of a computer.\n\n00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:47.314\nAnd what you find\nabout the radicalization process\n\n00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:48.961\nis it starts online,\n\n00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:50.556\nbut the first thing that happens\n\n00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.574\nis the person gets cut off\nfrom their community,\n\n00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.240\nfrom even their family,\n\n00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:58.032\nso that the extremist group\ncan brainwash them\n\n00:07:58.056 --> 00:08:02.354\ninto believing that they,\nthe terrorists, are the true Muslims,\n\n00:08:02.378 --> 00:08:06.394\nand everyone else who abhors\ntheir behavior and ideology\n\n00:08:06.418 --> 00:08:09.089\nare sellouts or apostates.\n\n00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:11.820\nSo if we want to prevent radicalization,\n\n00:08:11.844 --> 00:08:15.242\nwe have to keep people\ngoing to the mosque.\n\n00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:20.451\nNow, some will still argue\nIslam is a violent religion.\n\n00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:25.424\nAfter all, a group like ISIS\nbases its brutality on the Quran.\n\n00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:29.610\nNow, as a Muslim, as a mother,\nas a human being,\n\n00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:34.355\nI think we need to do everything we can\nto stop a group like ISIS.\n\n00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:40.558\nBut we would be giving in\nto their narrative\n\n00:08:40.582 --> 00:08:45.714\nif we cast them as representatives\nof a faith of 1.6 billion people.\n\n00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:49.824\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:49.848 --> 00:08:51.284\nThank you.\n\n00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.051\nISIS has as much to do with Islam\n\n00:08:57.075 --> 00:09:00.126\nas the Ku Klux Klan has to do\nwith Christianity.\n\n00:09:00.449 --> 00:09:05.116\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:06.753 --> 00:09:11.789\nBoth groups claim to base\ntheir ideology on their holy book.\n\n00:09:12.307 --> 00:09:15.331\nBut when you look at them,\nthey're not motivated\n\n00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:17.639\nby what they read in their holy book.\n\n00:09:17.663 --> 00:09:22.810\nIt's their brutality that makes them\nread these things into the scripture.\n\n00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:27.706\nRecently, a prominent imam\ntold me a story that really took me aback.\n\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.469\nHe said that a girl came to him\n\n00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:31.882\nbecause she was thinking\nof going to join ISIS.\n\n00:09:32.514 --> 00:09:34.562\nAnd I was really surprised and asked him,\n\n00:09:34.586 --> 00:09:37.832\nhad she been in contact\nwith a radical religious leader?\n\n00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:40.151\nAnd he said the problem\nwas quite the opposite,\n\n00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:43.902\nthat every cleric that she had\ntalked to had shut her down\n\n00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:47.523\nand said that her rage,\nher sense of injustice in the world,\n\n00:09:47.547 --> 00:09:49.632\nwas just going to get her in trouble.\n\n00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:53.337\nAnd so with nowhere to channel\nand make sense of this anger,\n\n00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:55.376\nshe was a prime target to be exploited\n\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.049\nby extremists promising her a solution.\n\n00:09:58.563 --> 00:10:02.829\nWhat this imam did was to connect her\nback to God and to her community.\n\n00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:08.124\nHe didn't shame her for her rage --\ninstead, he gave her constructive ways\n\n00:10:08.148 --> 00:10:10.685\nto make real change in the world.\n\n00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:15.401\nWhat she learned at that mosque\nprevented her from going to join ISIS.\n\n00:10:16.941 --> 00:10:18.196\nI've told you a little bit\n\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.010\nabout how Islamophobia\naffects me and my family.\n\n00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:23.574\nBut how does it impact ordinary Americans?\n\n00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:25.503\nHow does it impact everyone else?\n\n00:10:25.527 --> 00:10:31.293\nHow does consuming fear 24 hours a day\naffect the health of our democracy,\n\n00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:32.965\nthe health of our free thought?\n\n00:10:33.485 --> 00:10:37.356\nWell, one study -- actually,\nseveral studies in neuroscience --\n\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.241\nshow that when we're afraid,\nat least three things happen.\n\n00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:45.936\nWe become more accepting\nof authoritarianism,\n\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.408\nconformity and prejudice.\n\n00:10:49.152 --> 00:10:54.939\nOne study showed that when subjects\nwere exposed to news stories\n\n00:10:54.963 --> 00:10:57.947\nthat were negative about Muslims,\n\n00:10:57.971 --> 00:11:02.086\nthey became more accepting\nof military attacks on Muslim countries\n\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.126\nand policies that curtail the rights\nof American Muslims.\n\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.307\nNow, this isn't just academic.\n\n00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:12.723\nWhen you look at

around terrorist attacks.\n\n00:11:21.252 --> 00:11:25.645\nIt was in the run up to the Iraq War\nand during two election cycles.\n\n00:11:26.113 --> 00:11:30.657\nSo Islamophobia isn't just\nthe

--> 00:12:13.383\nDeah and his wife Yusor\nwere a young married couple\n\n00:12:13.407 --> 00:12:15.406\nliving in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,\n\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.029\nwhere they both went to school.\n\n00:12:17.644 --> 00:12:20.059\nDeah was an athlete.\n\n00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:23.615\nHe was in dental school,\ntalented, promising ...\n\n00:12:24.218 --> 00:12:28.436\nAnd his sister would tell me\nthat he was the sweetest,\n\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.495\nmost generous human being she knew.\n\n00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:34.373\nShe was visiting him there\nand he showed her his resume,\n\n00:12:34.397 --> 00:12:35.659\nand she was amazed.\n\n00:12:35.683 --> 00:12:39.913\nShe said, \"When did my baby brother\nbecome such an accomplished young man?\"\n\n00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:45.642\nJust a few weeks after Suzanne's visit\nto her brother and his new wife,\n\n00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:47.472\ntheir neighbor,\n\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.831\nCraig Stephen Hicks,\n\n00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:52.600\nmurdered them,\n\n00:12:52.624 --> 00:12:57.405\nas well as Yusor's sister, Razan,\nwho was visiting for the afternoon,\n\n00:12:57.429 --> 00:12:59.188\nin their apartment,\n\n00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.467\nexecution style,\n\n00:13:01.491 --> 00:13:05.447\nafter posting anti-Muslim statements\non his Facebook page.\n\n00:13:06.016 --> 00:13:07.760\nHe shot Deah eight times.\n\n00:13:09.212 --> 00:13:13.247\nSo bigotry isn't just immoral,\nit can even be lethal.\n\n00:13:14.313 --> 00:13:15.634\nSo, back to my story.\n\n00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:17.358\nWhat happened after 9/11?\n\n00:13:17.382 --> 00:13:20.510\nDid we go to the mosque\nor did we play it safe and stay home?\n\n00:13:21.348 --> 00:13:23.230\nWell, we talked it over,\n\n00:13:23.254 --> 00:13:25.943\nand it might seem like\na small decision, but to us,\n\n00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:29.823\nit was about what kind of America\nwe wanted to leave for our kids:\n\n00:13:29.847 --> 00:13:33.227\none that would control us by fear\n\n00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:36.745\nor one where we were practicing\nour religion freely.\n\n00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:38.617\nSo we decided to go to the mosque.\n\n00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:41.524\nAnd we put my son in his car seat,\n\n00:13:41.548 --> 00:13:45.239\nbuckled him in, and we drove silently,\nintensely, to the mosque.\n\n00:13:45.263 --> 00:13:49.140\nI took him out, I took off my shoes,\nI walked into the prayer hall\n\n00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:52.137\nand what I saw made me stop.\n\n00:13:53.229 --> 00:13:54.857\nThe place was completely full.\n\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.638\nAnd then the imam made an announcement,\n\n00:13:57.662 --> 00:14:01.928\nthanking and welcoming our guests,\n\n00:14:02.522 --> 00:14:04.736\nbecause half the congregation\n\n00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.519\nwere Christians, Jews,\nBuddhists, atheists,\n\n00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:10.963\npeople of faith and no faith,\n\n00:14:10.987 --> 00:14:15.888\nwho had come not to attack us,\nbut to stand in solidarity with us.\n\n00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:23.348\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:25.557 --> 00:14:27.680\nI just break down at this time.\n\n00:14:28.632 --> 00:14:33.176\nThese people were there because they chose\ncourage and compassion\n\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.298\nover panic and prejudice.\n\n00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:38.356\nWhat will you choose?\n\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.101\nWhat will you choose\nat this time of fear and bigotry?\n\n00:14:45.355 --> 00:14:47.066\nWill you play it safe?\n\n00:14:47.872 --> 00:14:50.171\nOr will you join those who say\n\n00:14:50.195 --> 00:14:52.183\nwe are better than that?\n\n00:14:52.207 --> 00:14:53.358\nThank you.\n\n00:14:53.382 --> 00:14:57.706\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:09.232\nThank you so much.\n\n00:15:12.455 --> 00:15:16.799\nHelen Walters: So Dalia,\nyou seem to have struck a chord.\n\n00:15:16.823 -->

00:15:24.203\nyou're clearly a deep thinker,\n\n00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:26.234\nyou work at a fancy think tank,\n\n00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.371\nyou're an exception, you're not the rule.\n\n00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.167\nWhat would you say to those people?\n\n00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:33.721\nDalia Mogahed: I would say,\ndon't let this stage distract you,\n\n00:15:33.745 -->

ordinary as they come.\n\n00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:46.654\nWhen you look at Muslims\naround the world --\n\n00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:49.509\nand I've done this, I've done\nthe largest study ever done\n\n00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:51.075\non Muslims around the world --\n\n00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:52.549\npeople want ordinary things.\n\n00:15:52.573 --> 00:15:54.398\nThey want prosperity for their

profit while making a difference", "duration": "754", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/audrey_choi_how_to_make_a_profit_while_making_a_difference", "transcript": "I believe big institutions have unique potential to create change, and I believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take.Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me, because trusting big institutions, not really part of my family legacy. My mother escaped North Korea when she was 10 years old. To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life: repressive governments, occupying armies and even armed border patrols. Later, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States, she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls would never be the best and brightest. Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the United States.Because of her bravery and passion, I've had all the opportunities that she never did, and that has made my story so different. Instead of running away from big institutions, I've actually run toward them. I've had the chance over the course of my career to work for The Wall Street Journal, the White House and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world, where I lead sustainable investing.Now, these institutions are like tankers, and working inside of them, I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave, and I've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets, the nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world, that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal, if we ask it to be.Now, I know some of you are thinking, global capital markets, positive social change, not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph. I think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean. It's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires. So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones, but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don't affect the tides, don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.But why is that? Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us, and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us, as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens. So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets, why aren't we able to make our voices heard? Why can't we make some waves?So let me ask you a different question: did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks? OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have? Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?So why do we do these things? Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion combustion engine vehicles. One fish is just one fish in the sea. And one cup of coffee doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. But we do these things because we believe they matter, that our actions add up, that our choices might influence others and collectively, what an impact we can have.So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago. It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it. Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says.\"This one cup can be used again and again.\"\"This one cup may inspire others to use one too.\"\"This one cup helps save the planet.\" I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.(Laughter)So why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters, but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our IRA doesn't? Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care, that we care about fair labor standards, that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities? Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars, but we would vote with our lattes?So I think it has something to do with the myths, the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness. Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot? If you said to the pot, \"Boil, little pot, boil,\" it would fill up with sweet porridge. And if you said, \"Stop, little pot, stop,\" it would stop. But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen, and things could go terribly awry. So I think when it comes to markets, we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads. We believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command: make more money. Only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold. Add in some extra words like \"protect the environment,\" the spell might not work. Put in the wrong words like \"promote social justice,\" and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely, according to this fable.So we asked people, what do you really think? And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors, and we found something fascinating. Overwhelmingly, people wanted to add those extra words into the formula. 71 percent of people said yes, they were interested in sustainable investing, which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance. 71 percent wanted that. 72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better financially. So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good. But here was the weird thing: 54 percent of the people still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks, they thought that they would make less money.So is it true? Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee instead of drinking it? Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben & Jerry's wouldn't say so. Right? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars each. But here's the important thing. Those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments, they had to preserve that socially conscious mission. If they didn't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious, those brands wouldn't make more money.But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right? The serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round, they need to stick to making more money. So, Harvard Business School actually researched this, and they found something fascinating. If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago in a portfolio of companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter, that one dollar would have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents. That's not bad until you consider that if instead you'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the most important environmental and social issues, that one dollar would have grown to 28 dollars and 36 cents. almost twice as much sweet porridge.Now, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen. They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business, like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes; like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served, not just quarterly results; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty, retention and productivity. Now, Harvard's not alone. Oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results, and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency, lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price.And then there's Al Gore. So 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House, he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change. Post-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation, where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process. And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views. Ten years later, his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing. Far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix, he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.Now, sustainable investing, the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret, and it's not just for the elite. It is not just about private equity for billionaires. It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn. It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies. It's about mutual funds. It's about all the things we already see in the market today.So here's why I'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal.First, the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right, preserving all the same good principles of investing, the traditional sphere, can pay. It makes sense.Secondly, the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads. We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking, that you get less sweet porridge. And once you get rid of the fable, you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.And third, the future is already here. Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market and it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry. In the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see. It now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States.So what are we waiting for? For me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother. She knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story. She was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle, no big institution stand in her way. She made it to the States, and she became a teacher, an award-winning author and a mother, and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard. And these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world. It seems almost too prophetic that her name in Korean means \"passionate clarity.\"Passionate clarity: that's what I think we need to drive change. Passion about the change we want to see in the world, and clarity that we are able to help chart the course. We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices. We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.So change your perspective. Vote with your small change. Invest in the change you want to see in the world. Change the fables and change the markets.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2431, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:15.014\nI believe big

institution\nof the global capital markets,\n\n00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:45.294\nthe nearly 290 trillion dollars\nof stocks and bonds in the world,\n\n00:01:45.318 --> 00:01:48.174\nthat that may be one\nof our most powerful forces\n\n00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:50.774\nfor positive social change\nat our disposal,\n\n00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.038\nif we ask it to be.\n\n00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.734\nNow, I know some of you are thinking,\n\n00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:57.254\nglobal capital markets,\npositive social change,\n\n00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:01.094\nnot usually in the same sentence\nor even the same paragraph.\n\n00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:03.454\nI think many people think\nof the capital markets\n\n00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:04.774\nkind of like an ocean.\n\n00:02:04.798 --> 00:02:08.614\nIt's a vast, impersonal,\nuncaring force of nature\n\n00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:11.294\nthat is not affected\nby our wishes or desires.\n\n00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:13.654\nSo the best that our\nlittle savings accounts\n\n00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:15.374\nor retirement accounts can do\n\n00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:17.974\nis to try to catch some waves\nin the good cycles\n\n00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:20.759\nand hope that we don't get\ninundated in the turbulent ones,\n\n00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:25.014\nbut certainly our decisions on how\nto steer our little retirement accounts\n\n00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:26.534\ndon't affect the tides,\n\n00:02:26.558 --> 00:02:29.958\ndon't change the shape or size\nor direction of the waves.\n\n00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:32.974\nBut why is that?\n\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:36.334\nBecause actually,\none third of this ocean of capital\n\n00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:39.974\nactually belongs to individuals like us,\n\n00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:42.054\nand most of the rest\nof the capital markets\n\n00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:45.294\nis controlled by the institutions\nthat get their power and authority\n\n00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:47.094\nand their capital from us,\n\n00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:51.254\nas members, participants,\nbeneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.\n\n00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:54.118\nSo if we are the ultimate owners\nof the capital markets,\n\n00:02:55.198 --> 00:02:57.318\nwhy aren't we able\nto make our voices heard?\n\n00:02:58.318 --> 00:02:59.878\nWhy can't we make some waves?\n\n00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:02.814\nSo let me ask you a different question:\n\n00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:05.054\ndid any of you buy fair trade coffee\n\n00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.734\nthe last time you were\nat a supermarket or at Starbucks?\n\n00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.174\nOK. Do any of you go to the restaurant\n\n00:03:10.198 --> 00:03:12.854\nand order the sustainably farmed trout\n\n00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:15.414\ninstead of the miso-glazed\nChilean sea bass\n\n00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:17.158\nthat you really wish you could have?\n\n00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:20.798\nDo any of you drive hybrid cars\nor even electric cars?\n\n00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:23.494\nSo why do we do these things?\n\n00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:27.374\nRight? One electric car doesn't amount\nto much in a fleet of 1.2 billion\n\n00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:28.878\ncombustion engine vehicles.\n\n00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:32.398\nOne fish is just one fish in the sea.\n\n00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:35.294\nAnd one cup of coffee\n\n00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:37.878\ndoesn't amount to a hill of beans\nin this crazy world.\n\n00:03:39.358 --> 00:03:41.894\nBut we do these things\nbecause we believe they matter,\n\n00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:43.174\nthat our actions add up,\n\n00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:45.094\nthat our choices might influence others\n\n00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:47.278\nand collectively,\nwhat an impact we can have.\n\n00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:51.814\nSo, in my bag I have a coffee mug\nthat I bought a couple of years ago.\n\n00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:54.774\nIt's a reusable mug.\nIt has all these things printed on it.\n\n00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:57.894\nLook at some of the things\nthat are on it, that it says.\n\n00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:00.454\n\"This one cup can be used\nagain and again.\"\n\n00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:04.334\n\"This one cup may inspire others\nto use one too.\"\n\n00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:06.654\n\"This one cup helps save the planet.\"\n\n00:04:06.678 --> 00:04:09.134\nI had no idea this plastic cup\nwas so powerful.\n\n00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:10.254\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:10.278 --> 00:04:12.174\nSo why do we think that our choice\n\n00:04:12.198 --> 00:04:16.014\nof a four dollar shade-grown\nfair trade artisanal cup of coffee\n\n00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:18.214\nin a reusable mug matters,\n\n00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:21.000\nbut what we do with 4,000 dollars\nin our investment account\n\n00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:22.424\nfor our IRA doesn't?\n\n00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:26.854\nWhy can't we tell the supermarket\nand the capital markets\n\n00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:28.294\nthat we care,\n\n00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:30.574\nthat we care about fair labor standards,\n\n00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:32.934\nthat we care about sustainable\nproduction methods\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.814\nand about healthy communities?\n\n00:04:34.838 --> 00:04:37.854\nWhy aren't we voting\nwith our investment dollars,\n\n00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:39.518\nbut we would vote with our lattes?\n\n00:04:40.478 --> 00:04:43.694\nSo I think it has something\nto do with the myths,\n\n00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:46.934\nthe fables that we all carry around\nin our collective consciousness.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.534\nDo you remember the Grimm's fairy tale\nabout the magic porridge pot?\n\n00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:52.934\nIf you said to the pot,\n\"Boil, little pot, boil,\"\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.254\nit would fill up with sweet porridge.\n\n00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.374\nAnd if you said, \"Stop, little pot, stop,\"\n\n00:04:57.398 --> 00:04:58.598\nit would stop.\n\n00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:02.574\nBut if you got the words wrong,\nit wouldn't listen,\n\n00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:04.358\nand things could go terribly awry.\n\n00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:07.334\nSo I think when it comes to markets,\n\n00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:09.854\nwe have a little bit\nof a similar fable in our heads.\n\n00:05:09.878 --> 00:05:12.214\nWe believe that the markets\nis this magic pot\n\n00:05:12.238 --> 00:05:14.094\nthat obeys only one command:\n\n00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:16.158\nmake more money.\n\n00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:19.774\nOnly those words said exactly that way\n\n00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:21.638\nwill make the pot fill up with gold.\n\n00:05:22.598 --> 00:05:25.934\nAdd in some extra words\nlike \"protect the environment,\"\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.598\nthe spell might not work.\n\n00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:31.118\nPut in the wrong words\nlike \"promote social justice,\"\n\n00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:34.534\nand you might see your gold coins shrink\n\n00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:37.398\nor even vanish entirely,\naccording to this fable.\n\n00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:41.174\nSo we asked people,\nwhat do you really think?\n\n00:05:41.198 --> 00:05:45.414\nAnd we actually went out and polled\na thousand individual investors,\n\n00:05:45.438 --> 00:05:47.454\nand we found something fascinating.\n\n00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:48.974\nOverwhelmingly,\n\n00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:52.614\npeople wanted to add\nthose extra words into the formula.\n\n00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.694\n71 percent of people said yes,\n\n00:05:55.718 --> 00:05:58.294\nthey were interested\nin sustainable investing,\n\n00:05:58.318 --> 00:06:01.254\nwhich we define as taking the best\nin class investment process\n\n00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:03.014\nthat you already have traditionally\n\n00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:05.094\nand adding in the extra\ninformation you get\n\n00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:08.374\nwhen you think about the environment\nand society and good governance.\n\n00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:10.134\n71 percent wanted that.\n\n00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:13.814\n72 percent said that they believe\nthat companies who did that\n\n00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:15.654\nwould actually do better financially.\n\n00:06:15.678 --> 00:06:19.334\nSo people really do believe\nthat you can do well by doing good.\n\n00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:20.774\nBut here was the weird thing:\n\n00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:22.334\n54 percent of the people\n\n00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:26.534\nstill said if they put their money\nin those kinds of stocks,\n\n00:06:26.558 --> 00:06:28.678\nthey thought that they\nwould make less money.\n\n00:06:29.838 --> 00:06:31.454\nSo is it true?\n\n00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:35.254\nDo you get less sweet porridge\nif you invest in shade-grown coffee\n\n00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:36.518\ninstead of drinking it?\n\n00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:40.974\nWell, you know, the investors\nin companies like Burt's Bees\n\n00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:42.774\nor Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.\n\n00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:46.774\nRight? Both of those started out\nas small, socially conscious companies\n\n00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:49.934\nthat ended up becoming\nso popular with consumers\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.014\nthat the giants Unilever\nand Clorox bought them\n\n00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:55.198\nfor hundreds of millions of dollars\n\n00:06:55.838 --> 00:06:57.038\neach.\n\n00:06:57.798 --> 00:06:59.334\nBut here's the important thing.\n\n00:06:59.358 --> 00:07:00.694\nThose corporations realized\n\n00:07:00.718 --> 00:07:03.654\nthat if they wanted to protect\nthe value of their investments,\n\n00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:06.174\nthey had to preserve\nthat socially conscious mission.\n\n00:07:06.198 --> 00:07:08.414\nIf they didn't keep adding in\nthose extra words\n\n00:07:08.438 --> 00:07:10.854\nof environmentally friendly\nand socially conscious,\n\n00:07:10.878 --> 00:07:12.958\nthose brands wouldn't make more money.\n\n00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:17.734\nBut maybe this is just the exception\nthe proves the rule, right?\n\n00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:20.294\nThe serious companies\nthat fund our economy\n\n00:07:20.318 --> 00:07:23.614\nand that fund our retirements\nand that really make the world go round,\n\n00:07:23.638 --> 00:07:26.078\nthey need to stick to making more money.\n\n00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:29.614\nSo, Harvard Business School\nactually researched this,\n\n00:07:29.638 --> 00:07:31.400\nand they found something fascinating.\n\n00:07:31.424 --> 00:07:34.054\nIf you had invested a dollar 20 years ago\n\n00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:35.734\nin a portfolio of companies\n\n00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:37.974\nthat focused narrowly on making more money\n\n00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:39.934\nquarter by quarter,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.374\nthat one dollar\n\n00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:45.254\nwould have grown\nto 14 dollars and 46 cents.\n\n00:07:45.278 --> 00:07:47.534\nThat's not bad until you consider\n\n00:07:47.558 --> 00:07:50.574\nthat if instead\nyou'd invested that same dollar\n\n00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:52.254\nin a portfolio of companies\n\n00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:54.088\nthat focused on growing their business\n\n00:07:54.112 --> 00:07:57.352\nand on the most important\nenvironmental and social issues,\n\n00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:00.174\nthat one dollar would have grown\n\n00:08:00.198 --> 00:08:03.638\nto 28 dollars and 36 cents.\n\n00:08:04.198 --> 00:08:07.094\nalmost twice as much sweet porridge.\n\n00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:10.094\nNow, let's be clear, they didn't make\nthat outperformance\n\n00:08:10.118 --> 00:08:13.014\nby giving away money\nto seem like a nice corporate citizen.\n\n00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:16.254\nThey did it by focusing on the things\nthat matter to their business,\n\n00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:18.694\nlike wasting less energy and water\n\n00:08:18.718 --> 00:08:20.494\nin their manufacturing processes;\n\n00:08:20.518 --> 00:08:23.894\nlike making sure the CEO contracts\nhad the CEOs incentivized\n\n00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:27.374\nfor the long-term results of the company\nand the communities they served,\n\n00:08:27.398 --> 00:08:28.774\nnot just quarterly results;\n\n00:08:28.798 --> 00:08:31.094\nor building a first class culture\n\n00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:33.454\nthat would have higher employee loyalty,\n\n00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:35.438\nretention and productivity.\n\n00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:37.694\nNow, Harvard's not alone.\n\n00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:41.734\nOxford also did a research study\nwhere they examined 120 different studies\n\n00:08:41.758 --> 00:08:45.214\nlooking at the effect\nof sustainability and economic results,\n\n00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:48.014\nand they found\ntime and time and time again\n\n00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:51.894\nthat the companies that cared\nabout these kinds of important things\n\n00:08:51.918 --> 00:08:53.958\nactually had better\noperational efficiency,\n\n00:08:54.558 --> 00:08:56.374\nlower cost of capital\n\n00:08:56.398 --> 00:08:58.638\nand better performance\nin their stock price.\n\n00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:00.814\nAnd then there's Al Gore.\n\n00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:03.774\nSo 20 years ago, when I worked\nfor Al Gore in the White House,\n\n00:09:03.798 --> 00:09:07.254\nhe was one of the early pioneers\npleading with businesses and governments\n\n00:09:07.278 --> 00:09:09.974\nto pay attention to the challenges\nof climate change.\n\n00:09:09.998 --> 00:09:13.046\nPost-White House, he opened\nan investment firm called Generation,\n\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.334\nwhere he baked environmental\nsustainability and other things\n\n00:09:16.358 --> 00:09:18.238\nright into the core investment process.\n\n00:09:18.798 --> 00:09:22.454\nAnd at the time there was\na good bit of skepticism about his views.\n\n00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:26.214\nTen years later, his track record\nis one more proof point\n\n00:09:26.238 --> 00:09:29.934\nthat sustainable investing done right\ncan be sound investing.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.814\nFar from making less sweet porridge\n\n00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:34.214\nbecause he added\nsustainability into the mix,\n\n00:09:34.238 --> 00:09:36.918\nhe actually significantly\noutperformed the benchmark.\n\n00:09:37.518 --> 00:09:39.054\nNow, sustainable investing,\n\n00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:41.958\nthe good news is\nit doesn't require a magic spell\n\n00:09:42.878 --> 00:09:46.054\nand it doesn't require\nsome investment secret,\n\n00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:47.654\nand it's not just for the elite.\n\n00:09:47.678 --> 00:09:51.174\nIt is not just about private equity\nfor billionaires.\n\n00:09:51.198 --> 00:09:54.151\nIt's not just groovy-sounding investments\nlike clean technology\n\n00:09:54.175 -->

we've been talking about.\n\n00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:50.614\nAnd third, the future is already here.\n\n00:10:50.638 --> 00:10:53.614\nSustainable investment today\nis a 20 trillion dollar

00:11:07.678\nSo what are we waiting for?\n\n00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:12.452\nFor me, it goes back to the inspiration\nthat I received from my mother.\n\n00:11:13.198 --> 00:11:14.734\nShe knew that she wanted a life\n\n00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.398\nwhere she would have the freedom\nto make her own choices\n\n00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:21.454\nand to have her voice heard\nand write her own

00:11:30.118\nno big institution stand in her way.\n\n00:11:30.998 --> 00:11:32.854\nShe made it to the States,\n\n00:11:32.878 --> 00:11:34.614\nand she became a teacher,\n\n00:11:34.638 --> 00:11:36.334\nan award-winning author\n\n00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:37.614\nand a mother,\n\n00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:40.334\nand ended up sending\nher daughters to Harvard.\n\n00:11:40.358 -->

00:11:49.454\nIt seems almost too prophetic\n\n00:11:49.478 --> 00:11:51.774\nthat her name in Korean means\n\n00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:53.078\n\"passionate clarity.\"\n\n00:11:54.238 -->

your doctor should care about social justice", "duration": "829", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_bassett_why_your_doctor_should_care_about_social_justice", "transcript": "When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy. The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: health care services, primary education became essentially free. A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, a truly remarkable accomplishment. In 1980, the year of independence, 25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized. By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent.I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution. The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable. Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans \u2014 scientists, doctors, activists \u2014 I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive public health movement.But there were daunting challenges. Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived. I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but \u2014 we had no idea what lay in store for Africa. Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there. These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later. By the mid-1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-positive. I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die.In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic. We did condom demonstrations. We launched school education and workplace interventions. We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves. We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best. I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was. But I was not talking about structural change.Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide. In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department. At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, he reflected, \"I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support.\"The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier.But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one. I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills. And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus. I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS. And on the sugar plantations, which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise, 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-positive.I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority, to forced migrant labor and to colonialism. Whites were largely unscathed.As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, reduce number of partners. Infection rates climbed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa. I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population. I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country, that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much-needed research. So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS. I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.Many doctors, health professionals, may think I did nothing wrong. Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship. And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine.But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more. It was true of AIDS. It was true just recently of Ebola. Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power; and violence because its impact \u2014 premature deaths, suffering, illness \u2014 is violent. We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices. Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together.So these days, I'm not staying quiet. I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, even when it makes me uncomfortable. And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health. But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut short. That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner. In New York City, premature mortality \u2014 that's death before the age of 65 \u2014 is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones. A black woman in 2012 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman. And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby.New York City's not exceptional. These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States. A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country. They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or premature death. There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter. But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions \u2014 heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV \u2014 diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely.As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word \"racism\" in our research and our work. You've probably felt something every time I've said it. Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats, but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality. And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health.As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great injustice: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities; the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child.Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change. Rightfully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and we shouldn't waste that.I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity. I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality. It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality. We don't have to have all the answers to call for change. We just need courage. The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it.(Applause)", "id": 2445, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:16.054\nWhen I moved to Harare in 1985,\n\n00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:20.854\nsocial justice was at the core\nof Zimbabwe's national health policy.\n\n00:00:20.878 --> 00:00:24.574\nThe new government emerged\nfrom a long war of independence\n\n00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:27.414\nand immediately proclaimed\na socialist agenda:\n\n00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:30.814\nhealth care services, primary education\n\n00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.694\nbecame essentially free.\n\n00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:36.574\nA massive expansion\nof rural health centers\n\n00:00:36.598 --> 00:00:39.294\nplaced roughly 80 percent\nof the population\n\n00:00:39.318 --> 00:00:42.494\nless than a two-hour walk\nfrom these facilities,\n\n00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:45.294\na truly remarkable accomplishment.\n\n00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:47.974\nIn 1980, the year of independence,\n\n00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:52.174\n25 percent of Zimbabwean children\nwere fully immunized.\n\n00:00:52.198 --> 00:00:55.494\nBy 1990, a mere decade later,\n\n00:00:55.518 --> 00:00:58.238\nthis proportion stood at 80 percent.\n\n00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:04.054\nI felt tremendously privileged\nto be part of this transformation,\n\n00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:05.534\na revolution.\n\n00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:09.398\nThe excitement,\nthe camaraderie, was palpable.\n\n00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:13.414\nWorking side by side\nwith brilliant Zimbabweans --\n\n00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:16.374\nscientists, doctors, activists --\n\n00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:21.374\nI felt connected not only\nto an African independence movement,\n\n00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:25.878\nbut to a global progressive\npublic health movement.\n\n00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:29.974\nBut there were daunting challenges.\n\n00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:35.574\nZimbabwe reported its first AIDS case\nin 1985, the year I arrived.\n\n00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:39.374\nI had taken care of a few patients\nwith AIDS in the early 1980s,\n\n00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:42.918\nwhen I did my medical training\nat Harlem Hospital, but --\n\n00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.718\nwe had no idea\nwhat lay in store for Africa.\n\n00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:53.294\nInfection rate stood at about\ntwo percent in my early days there.\n\n00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:55.134\nThese would soar\n\n00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:58.534\nto one out of every four adults\n\n00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:01.998\nby the time I left Harare 17 years later.\n\n00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:04.174\nBy the mid-1990s,\n\n00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:08.334\nI'd told hundreds of people\nin the prime of life\n\n00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:10.574\nthat they were HIV-positive.\n\n00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:13.694\nI saw colleagues and friends die,\n\n00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:17.718\nmy students, hospital patients, die.\n\n00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:22.094\nIn response, my colleagues and I\nset up a clinic.\n\n00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:24.654\nWe did condom demonstrations.\n\n00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:30.094\nWe launched school education\nand workplace interventions.\n\n00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:34.694\nWe did research.

out\n\n00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:21.134\nabout the unequal access\nto these life-saving drugs\n\n00:05:21.158 --> 00:05:24.814\nor about the underlying\neconomic and political systems\n\n00:05:24.838 -->

00:05:38.854\nby reminding myself\nthat I was a guest in the country,\n\n00:05:38.878 --> 00:05:41.814\nthat sounding the alarm\ncould even get me kicked out,\n\n00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:43.494\nkeep me

our society,\n\n00:06:28.118 --> 00:06:30.134\nreflecting not only biology,\n\n00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:35.774\nbut more importantly\npatterns of marginalization, exclusion,\n\n00:06:35.798 -->

quiet.\n\n00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:49.974\nI'm speaking up about a lot of things,\n\n00:07:49.998 --> 00:07:53.654\neven when it makes listeners\nuncomfortable,\n\n00:07:53.678 --> 00:07:56.598\neven

"https://www.ted.com/talks/ivan_coyote_why_we_need_gender_neutral_bathrooms", "transcript": "There are a few things that all of us need. We all need air to breathe. We need clean water to drink. We need food to eat. We need shelter and love. You know. Love is great, too. And we all need a safe place to pee.(Laughter) Yeah?As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary, if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate, the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places.(Applause) Trans people and trans issues, they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately. And this is a great and necessary thing, but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals, most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous, and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee in between classes at their community college, or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school. Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.Public bathrooms. They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember, first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.(Laughter)Now, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed. I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors. I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up. I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about, and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection.(Laughter)And I know what some of you are thinking, and you're mostly right. I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days. But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it? And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man. I'm a trans person.And now we've got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills. Have you heard about these? They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth. And if these politicians ever get their way, in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston, Texas, or Ottawa, well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table, I can't help but wonder, you know, just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right? Panty checks? Really. Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools? There's no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway. They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia. They don't make anyone safer. But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.And meanwhile, our trans children suffer. They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether. Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms, but also universities, hospitals, libraries. Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone, then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places. We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes, which I do not. I never have. And this starts very early.I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine. She's a self-identified tomboy. I'm talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards. One time I asked her what her favorite color was. She told me, \"Camouflage.\"(Laughter)So that awesome little kid, she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom. And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom. And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party, and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good. And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.Her and her classmates were four years old. They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms. She was four years old. She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her. She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem, and that problem started with her and was hers alone. So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter, and I did. I wanted to tell her that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away, but I knew that wasn't true. I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older, but I couldn't. So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened, asked her to tell me how it made her feel. \"Mad and sad,\" she told me. So I told her that she wasn't alone and that it wasn't right what had happened to her, and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before. I said yes, I had, but not for a really long time.(Laughter)Which of course was a lie, because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43, and sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze, when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching. Don't lie. It happens. Right? She doesn't need to know that, I figure.(Laughter)I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too. When you get old like me, you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer, I promised her.\"Until you can get home?\" she asked me.I said, \"Yes, until you can get home.\" She seemed to take some comfort in that.So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes. We can't change the world overnight for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world, if only for just a minute. This we can do. So let's just do it.And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority, or it's too expensive, or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality, or your masculinity, or your religious beliefs, then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully, does care about the rest of the population. If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me, then what about women and girls with body image issues? What about anyone with body image stuff going on? What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates, whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey? Oh, grade eight, what a cruel master you can be. Right? What about people with anxiety issues? What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there? What about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason, don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like? How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers, and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise?

It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures. I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little. As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age. But the first time I truly went underwater, I was about 10 years old. And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef. And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow. That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.Thomas PeschakConservation PhotographerIn my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation. I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand. I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest. And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean. And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find. They are becoming more compressed and more threatened. As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand. For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images. And while this approach has merits, I have come full circle. I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love. I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface. You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists. Uncovering this \u2014 that is the power of conservation photography.(Music)I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply. The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged, wild coast. And every June and July, enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run. And boy, do those fish have good reason to run. In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators. Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls. They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast. Close behind are sharks. Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist. In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively. Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut, or a mouth full of water. Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run, I know they don't see me as prey. However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.From the shores of Africa we travel east, across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands. And during the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru. Armies of crustaceans, most no bigger than the size of your pupils, are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet. When plankton concentrations become patchy, manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again, very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.(Music)However, when plankton densities increase, the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains, and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after. As plankton levels peak in the bay, the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding. And as they swirl in tight formation, this multi-step column of mantas creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths. The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.(Music)When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development. And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine-protected area. Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins. Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, \"There be dragons.\" And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean. Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.Very few people have heard of Bassas da India, a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel. Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks. These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day. I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night.(Music)Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop. Capturing and sharing moments like this \u2014 that reminds me why I chose my path.Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California. And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a critical calving ground for gray whales. For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors. Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us.(Music)This species truly has made a remarkable comeback.Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village. Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse. In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve. But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous. In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.But don't take my word for it \u2014 come with me. On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.(Music)We all have the ability to be creators of hope. And through my photography, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans. And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean. Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist. And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lagoon or possibly, in the one after it.(Music)", "id": 2434, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.395\nAs a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.\n\n00:00:15.419 -->

00:02:31.112\n(Music)\n\n00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.319\nI've visited hundreds of marine locations,\n\n00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:37.269\nbut there are a handful of seascapes\n\n00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:39.307\nthat have touched me incredibly deeply.\n\n00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:43.604\nThe first time I experienced\nthat kind of high\n\n00:02:43.628 --> 00:02:45.021\nwas about 10 years ago,\n\n00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.880\noff South Africa's rugged, wild coast.\n\n00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:49.250\nAnd every June and July,\n\n00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:51.683\nenormous shoals of sardines\ntravel northwards\n\n00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:54.032\nin a mass migration\nwe call the Sardine Run.\n\n00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:56.665\nAnd boy, do those fish\nhave good reason to run.\n\n00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.978\nIn hot pursuit are hoards\nof hungry and agile predators.\n\n00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:02.860\nCommon dolphins hunt together\n\n00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.805\nand they can separate some\nof the sardines from the main shoal\n\n00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.233\nand they create bait balls.\n\n00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:10.945\nThey drive and trap the fish upward\nagainst the ocean surface\n\n00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.537\nand then they rush in to dine\n\n00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:15.372\non this pulsating and movable feast.\n\n00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:17.192\nClose behind are sharks.\n\n00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:18.371\nNow, most people believe\n\n00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:20.772\nthat sharks and dolphins\nare these mortal enemies,\n\n00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:23.568\nbut during the Sardine Run,\nthey actually coexist.\n\n00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:27.763\nIn fact, dolphins actually\nhelp sharks feed more effectively.\n\n00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:31.369\nWithout dolphins, the bait balls\nare more dispersed\n\n00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:35.131\nand sharks often end up\nwith what I call a sardine donut,\n\n00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:36.615\nor a mouth full of water.\n\n00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.680\nNow, while I've had a few spicy moments\nwith sharks on the sardine run,\n\n00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:42.770\nI know they don't see me as prey.\n\n00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:45.997\nHowever, I get bumped and tail-slapped\njust like any other guest\n\n00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:47.790\nat this rowdy, rowdy banquet.\n\n00:03:49.743 --> 00:03:52.672\nFrom the shores of Africa we travel east,\n\n00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.797\nacross the vastness\nthat is the Indian Ocean\n\n00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:58.713\nto the Maldives, an archipelago\nof coral islands.\n\n00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.275\nAnd during the stormy southwest monsoon,\n\n00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.609\nmanta rays from all across the archipelago\n\n00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:06.886\ntravel to a tiny speck\nin Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.\n\n00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.093\nArmies of crustaceans,\n\n00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:10.331\nmost no bigger than the size\nof your pupils,\n\n00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:13.540\nare the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.\n\n00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:16.926\nWhen plankton concentrations\nbecome patchy,\n\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.136\nmanta rays feed alone\n\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.872\nand they somersault themselves\nbackwards again and again,\n\n00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:23.247\nvery much like a puppy\nchasing its own tail.\n\n00:04:23.715 --> 00:04:25.715\n(Music)\n\n00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.462\nHowever, when plankton densities increase,\n\n00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:33.685\nthe mantas line up head-to-tail\nto form these long feeding chains,\n\n00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:37.033\nand any tasty morsel that escapes\nthe first or second manta in line\n\n00:04:37.057 --> 00:04:40.513\nis surely to be gobbled up\nby the next or the one after.\n\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.766\nAs plankton levels peak in the bay,\n\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.995\nthe mantas swim closer and closer together\n\n00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.380\nin a unique behavior\nwe call cyclone feeding.\n\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.080\nAnd as they swirl in tight formation,\n\n00:04:51.104 --> 00:04:52.775\nthis multi-step column of mantas\n\n00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:56.676\ncreates its own vortex, sucking in\nand delivering the plankton\n\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.508\nright into the mantas' cavernous mouths.\n\n00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:03.874\nThe experience of diving\namongst such masses of hundreds of rays\n\n00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:05.926\nis truly unforgettable.\n\n00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.839\n(Music)\n\n00:05:54.206 --> 00:05:55.887\nWhen I first photographed Hanifaru,\n\n00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:57.473\nthe site enjoyed no protection\n\n00:05:57.497 --> 00:05:59.120\nand was threatened by development.\n\n00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:01.247\nAnd working with NGOs\nlike the Manta Trust,\n\n00:06:01.271 --> 00:06:03.152\nmy images eventually helped Hanifaru\n\n00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:05.603\nbecome a marine-protected area.\n\n00:06:05.627 --> 00:06:07.703\nNow, fisherman from neighboring islands,\n\n00:06:07.727 --> 00:06:09.397\nthey once hunted these manta rays\n\n00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:12.045\nto make traditional drums\nfrom their skins.\n\n00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.744\nToday, they are the most ardent\nconservation champions\n\n00:06:15.768 --> 00:06:18.045\nand manta rays earn the Maldivian economy\n\n00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.782\nin excess of 8 million dollars\nevery single year.\n\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.489\nI have always wanted\nto travel back in time\n\n00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:28.103\nto an era where maps were mostly blank\n\n00:06:28.127 --> 00:06:30.056\nor they read, \"There be dragons.\"\n\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.664\nAnd today, the closest I've come\nis visiting remote atolls\n\n00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:35.380\nin the western Indian Ocean.\n\n00:06:35.404 --> 00:06:38.625\nFar, far away from shipping lanes\nand fishing fleets,\n\n00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.983\ndiving into these waters\nis a poignant reminder\n\n00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:44.435\nof what our oceans once looked like.\n\n00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:47.088\nVery few people have heard\nof Bassas da India,\n\n00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:50.533\na tiny speck of coral\nin the Mozambique Channel.\n\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.303\nIts reef forms a protective outer barrier\n\n00:06:54.327 --> 00:06:57.003\nand the inner lagoon is a nursery ground\n\n00:06:57.027 --> 00:06:58.542\nfor Galapagos sharks.\n\n00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:03.173\nThese sharks are anything but shy,\neven during the day.\n\n00:07:03.197 --> 00:07:05.816\nI had a bit of a hunch\nthat they'd be even bolder\n\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.451\nand more abundant at night.\n\n00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.030\n(Music)\n\n00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:18.010\nNever before have I encountered\n\n00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:21.307\nso many sharks on a single coral outcrop.\n\n00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:24.336\nCapturing and sharing moments like this --\n\n00:07:25.438 --> 00:07:28.042\nthat reminds me why I chose my path.\n\n00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:33.204\nEarlier this year, I was on assignment\nfor National Geographic Magazine\n\n00:07:33.228 --> 00:07:34.846\nin Baja California.\n\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.607\nAnd about halfway down the peninsula\non the Pacific side\n\n00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:39.070\nlies San Ignacio Lagoon,\n\n00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:41.608\na critical calving ground for gray whales.\n\n00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:45.898\nFor 100 years, this coast was the scene\nof a wholesale slaughter,\n\n00:07:45.922 --> 00:07:48.334\nwhere more than 20,000\ngray whales were killed,\n\n00:07:48.358 --> 00:07:50.632\nleaving only a few hundred survivors.\n\n00:07:50.656 --> 00:07:53.326\nToday the descendents of these same whales\n\n00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.213\nnudge their youngsters to the surface\n\n00:07:55.237 --> 00:07:58.292\nto play and even interact with us.\n\n00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:01.205\n(Music)\n\n00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:12.955\nThis species truly has made\na remarkable comeback.\n\n00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:17.497\nNow, on the other side\nof the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,\n\n00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:19.194\na sleepy fishing village.\n\n00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:22.652\nDecades of overfishing\nhad brought them close to collapse.\n\n00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:25.136\nIn 1995, local fisherman\nconvinced the authorities\n\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.412\nto proclaim their waters a marine reserve.\n\n00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:30.989\nBut what happened next\nwas nothing short of miraculous.\n\n00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:35.283\nIn 2005, after only\na single decade of protection,\n\n00:08:35.307 --> 00:08:39.800\nscientists measured the largest\nrecovery of fish ever recorded.\n\n00:08:39.824 --> 00:08:42.235\nBut don't take my word\nfor it -- come with me.\n\n00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:44.997\nOn a single breath, swim with me in deep,\n\n00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:48.053\ninto one of the largest\nand densest schools of fish\n\n00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:50.650\nI have ever encountered.\n\n00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:53.443\n(Music)\n\n00:09:03.093 --> 00:09:05.927\nWe all have the ability\nto be creators of hope.\n\n00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:07.879\nAnd through my photography,\n\n00:09:07.903 --> 00:09:11.366\nI want to pass on the message\nthat it is not too late for our oceans.\n\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.825\nAnd particularly, I want to focus\non nature's resilience\n\n00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:18.835\nin the face of 7.3 billion people.\n\n00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.676\nMy hope is that in the future,\n\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.650\nI will have to search much, much harder\n\n00:09:22.674 --> 00:09:24.859\nto make photographs like this,\n\n00:09:24.883 --> 00:09:26.968\nwhile creating images that showcase\n\n00:09:26.992 --> 00:09:30.011\nour respectful coexistence with the ocean.\n\n00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:33.436\nThose will hopefully become\nan everyday occurrence for me.\n\n00:09:34.794 --> 00:09:37.069\nTo thrive and survive in my profession,\n\n00:09:37.093 --> 00:09:40.086\nyou really have to be a hopeless optimist.\n\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.131\nAnd I always operate on the assumption\n\n00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:45.260\nthat the next great picture\nthat will effect change\n\n00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:47.087\nis right around the corner,\n\n00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:49.444\nbehind the next coral head,\n\n00:09:49.468 --> 00:09:51.070\ninside the next lagoon\n\n00:09:51.094 --> 00:09:53.743\nor possibly, in the one after it.\n\n00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.631\n(Music)"}, {"title": "How yarn bombing grew into a worldwide movement", "duration": "330", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/magda_sayeg_how_yarn_bombing_grew_into_a_worldwide_movement", "transcript": "I'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement. Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment, graffiti-style \u2014 or, more specifically, without permission and unsanctioned.But when I started this over 10 years ago, I didn't have a word for it, I didn't have any ambitious notions about it, I had no visions of grandeur. All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like on the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.So I wrapped the door handle. I call this the Alpha Piece. Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.So clearly the reaction was interesting. It intrigued me and I thought, \"What else could I do?\" Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction? So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house. The reaction was wild. People would park their cars and get out of their cars and stare at it, and scratch their heads and stare at it, and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it, and all of that was really exciting to me and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood. And the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.So at this point I'm smitten. I'm hooked. This was all seductive. I found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground.So this is some of my early work. I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the mundane, even the ugly, and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting. And this was fun for me. It was really fun to take inanimate objects and have them come to life.So ... I think we all see the humor in this, but \u2014(Laughter)I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously. I wanted to analyze it. I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life, why I was passionate about it, why were other people reacting so strongly to it. And I realized something. We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable.I think we've all become desensitized by our overdeveloped cities that we live in, and billboards and advertisements, and giant parking lots, and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore. So when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then gradually \u2014 weirdly \u2014 you find a connection to it, that is the moment. That is the moment I love and that is the moment I love to share with others.So at this point, my curiosity grew. It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can I do with this material. Can I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?So that's when the bus happened. This was a real game changer for me. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one.At this point, people were recognizing my work but there wasn't much out there that was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale, and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting.So at this point, I'm experiencing, or I'm witnessing something interesting. I may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore. It had reached global status. People from all over the world were doing this. And I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world that I'd never been to, and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it.So as I pursued my own goals with my art \u2014 this is a lot of my recent work \u2014 so was yarn bombing. Yarn bombing was also growing. And that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft and showed me that there was this common language I had with the rest of the world. It was through this granny hobby \u2014 this unassuming hobby \u2014 that I found commonality with people that I never thought I'd have a connection with.So as I tell my story today, I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.If you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're capable of doing \u2014 building houses and furniture, and painting giant murals \u2014 and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone. And I'm totally guilty of this as well. But if you think about it, what would happen if you put those things down? What would you make? What would you create with your own hands?A lot of people think that I am a master knitter but I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life. But I did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before.I also wasn't \"supposed to be\" an artist in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this \u2014 I'm a math major actually. So I didn't think this was in the cards for me, but I also know that I didn't stumble upon this. And when this happened to me, I held on tight, I fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today.So as we ponder the future, know that your future might not be so seamless. And one day, you might be as bored as I was and knit a door handle to change your world forever.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2437, "subtitle":

stare at it,\n\n00:01:09.758 --> 00:01:11.694\nand scratch their heads and stare at it,\n\n00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:14.214\nand take pictures of it\nand take pictures next to it,\n\n00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:16.214\nand all of that was really exciting to me\n\n00:01:16.238 --> 00:01:19.254\nand I wanted to do every stop sign pole\nin the neighborhood.\n\n00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.878\nAnd the more that I did,\nthe stronger the reaction.\n\n00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:24.254\nSo at this point I'm smitten.\n\n00:01:24.278 --> 00:01:25.534\nI'm hooked.\n\n00:01:25.558 --> 00:01:26.814\nThis was all seductive.\n\n00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:28.574\nI found my new passion\n\n00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:30.718\nand the urban environment\nwas my playground.\n\n00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:33.318\nSo this is some of my early work.\n\n00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:38.014\nI was very curious about this idea\nof enhancing the ordinary,\n\n00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:39.774\nthe mundane, even the ugly,\n\n00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:43.454\nand not taking away its identity\nor its functionality\n\n00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.854\nbut just giving it a well-tailored\nsuit out of knitting.\n\n00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:48.614\nAnd this was fun for me.\n\n00:01:48.638 --> 00:01:50.894\nIt was really fun\nto take inanimate objects\n\n00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:52.598\nand have them come to life.\n\n00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:54.814\nSo ...\n\n00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:56.694\nI think we all see the humor in this,\n\n00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:57.934\nbut --\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.054\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:01.774\nI was at a point where\nI wanted to take it seriously.\n\n00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:03.054\nI wanted to analyze it.\n\n00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:05.814\nI wanted to know why I was letting\nthis take over my life,\n\n00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:07.294\nwhy I was passionate about it,\n\n00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:09.854\nwhy were other people\nreacting so strongly to it.\n\n00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:11.158\nAnd I realized something.\n\n00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:14.654\nWe all live in this\nfast-paced, digital world,\n\n00:02:14.678 --> 00:02:18.238\nbut we still crave and desire\nsomething that's relatable.\n\n00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.374\nI think we've all become desensitized\n\n00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:23.974\nby our overdeveloped\ncities that we live in,\n\n00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.774\nand billboards and advertisements,\n\n00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:28.414\nand giant parking lots,\n\n00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:31.294\nand we don't even complain\nabout that stuff anymore.\n\n00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:32.574\nSo when you stumble upon\n\n00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:34.934\na stop sign pole\nthat's wrapped in knitting\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.654\nand it seems so out of place\n\n00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:38.534\nand then gradually -- weirdly --\n\n00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.374\nyou find a connection to it,\n\n00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:41.614\nthat is the moment.\n\n00:02:41.638 --> 00:02:42.854\nThat is the moment I love\n\n00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:45.318\nand that is the moment\nI love to share with others.\n\n00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:49.374\nSo at this point, my curiosity grew.\n\n00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:52.174\nIt went from the fire hydrants\nand the stop sign poles\n\n00:02:52.198 --> 00:02:54.151\nto what else can I do with this material.\n\n00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:58.174\nCan I do something big\nand large-scale and insurmountable?\n\n00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:00.678\nSo that's when the bus happened.\n\n00:03:03.198 --> 00:03:05.214\nThis was a real game changer for me.\n\n00:03:05.238 --> 00:03:08.054\nI'll always have a soft spot\nin my heart for this one.\n\n00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:10.254\nAt this point, people\nwere recognizing my work\n\n00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:11.774\nbut there wasn't much out there\n\n00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:14.174\nthat was wrapped in knitting\nthat was large-scale,\n\n00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:17.454\nand this definitely was the first\ncity bus to be wrapped in knitting.\n\n00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:19.214\nSo at this point, I'm experiencing,\n\n00:03:19.238 --> 00:03:21.294\nor I'm witnessing something interesting.\n\n00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:24.734\nI may have started yarn bombing\nbut I certainly don't own it anymore.\n\n00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:26.294\nIt had reached global status.\n\n00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:28.509\nPeople from all over the world\nwere doing this.\n\n00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:31.724\nAnd I know this because I would travel\nto certain parts of the world\n\n00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:32.914\nthat I'd never been to,\n\n00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.073\nand I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole\nand I knew I didn't wrap it.\n\n00:03:36.097 --> 00:03:40.214\nSo as I pursued\nmy own goals with my art --\n\n00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:42.158\nthis is a lot of my recent work --\n\n00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:44.334\nso was yarn bombing.\n\n00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:45.814\nYarn bombing was also growing.\n\n00:03:45.838 --> 00:03:50.174\nAnd that experience showed me\nthe hidden power of this craft\n\n00:03:50.198 --> 00:03:51.934\nand showed me\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.838\nthat there was this common language\nI had with the rest of the world.\n\n00:03:57.318 --> 00:03:59.574\nIt was through this granny hobby --\n\n00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:01.734\nthis unassuming hobby --\n\n00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:04.654\nthat I found commonality with people\n\n00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:07.238\nthat I never thought\nI'd have a connection with.\n\n00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:10.854\nSo as I tell my story today,\n\n00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:12.334\nI'd also like to convey to you\n\n00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:15.774\nthat hidden power can be found\nin the most unassuming places,\n\n00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:19.038\nand we all possess skills\nthat are just waiting to be discovered.\n\n00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:22.734\nIf you think about our hands,\nthese tools that are connected to us,\n\n00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.134\nand what they're capable of doing --\n\n00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:26.814\nbuilding houses and furniture,\n\n00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:28.414\nand painting giant murals --\n\n00:04:28.438 --> 00:04:32.094\nand most of the time\nwe hold a controller or a cell phone.\n\n00:04:32.118 --> 00:04:34.694\nAnd I'm totally guilty of this as well.\n\n00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:36.014\nBut if you think about it,\n\n00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:38.254\nwhat would happen\nif you put those things down?\n\n00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.238\nWhat would you make?\nWhat would you create with your own hands?\n\n00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:44.294\nA lot of people think\nthat I am a master knitter\n\n00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:47.374\nbut I actually couldn't knit\na sweater to save my life.\n\n00:04:47.398 --> 00:04:49.534\nBut I did something\ninteresting with knitting\n\n00:04:49.558 --> 00:04:51.374\nthat had never been done before.\n\n00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:53.854\nI also wasn't \"supposed to be\" an artist\n\n00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:57.294\nin the sense that I wasn't\nformally trained to do this --\n\n00:04:57.318 --> 00:04:58.934\nI'm a math major actually.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.814\nSo I didn't think\nthis was in the cards for me,\n\n00:05:01.838 --> 00:05:04.774\nbut I also know that I didn't\nstumble upon this.\n\n00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:07.254\nAnd when this happened to me,\nI held on tight,\n\n00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:11.198\nI fought for it and I'm proud to say\nthat I am a working artist today.\n\n00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:14.758\nSo as we ponder the future,\n\n00:05:15.238 --> 00:05:17.429\nknow that your future\nmight not be so seamless.\n\n00:05:17.453 --> 00:05:20.454\nAnd one day, you might\nbe as bored as I was\n\n00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:23.854\nand knit a door handle\nto change your world forever.\n\n00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:25.094\nThank you.\n\n00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:28.934\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What really happens when you mix medications?", "duration": "881", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/russ_altman_what_really_happens_when_you_mix_medications", "transcript": "So you go to the doctor and get some tests. The doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit from medication to treat it. So you get a pillbox. You have some confidence, your physician has some confidence that this is going to work. The company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA. They studied it very carefully, skeptically, they approved it. They have a rough idea of how it works, they have a rough idea of what the side effects are. It should be OK. You have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you've been blue, haven't felt like yourself, you haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do. Your physician says, \"You know, I think you have some depression. I'm going to have to give you another pill.\"So now we're talking about two medications. This pill also \u2014 millions of people have taken it, the company did studies, the FDA looked at it \u2014 all good. Think things should go OK. Think things should go OK. Well, wait a minute. How much have we studied these two together?Well, it's very hard to do that. In fact, it's not traditionally done. We totally depend on what we call \"post-marketing surveillance,\" after the drugs hit the market. How can we figure out if bad things are happening between two medications? Three? Five? Seven? Ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses how many medications they're on.Why do I care about this problem? I care about it deeply. I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion, the only hope \u2014 only hope \u2014 to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it's not so safe.So let me tell you a data science story. And it begins with my student Nick. Let's call him \"Nick,\" because that's his name.(Laughter)Nick was a young student. I said, \"You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately, and we don't have a great understanding. But the FDA has made available an amazing database. It's a database of adverse events. They literally put on the web \u2014 publicly available, you could all download it right now \u2014 hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports from patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists. And these reports are pretty simple: it has all the diseases that the patient has, all the drugs that they're on, and all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience. It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today, but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.So I said to Nick, \"Let's think about glucose. Glucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes. Let's see if we can understand glucose response. I sent Nick off. Nick came back.\"Russ,\" he said, \"I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database, and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not.\"He did it. It was very simple, in a way. He took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose, and said, \"What's the difference in their side effects? Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?\" All those things conspired to give him a really good predictor. He said, \"Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose.\"I said, \"Nick, that's great.\" He's a young student, you have to build his confidence. \"But Nick, there's a problem. It's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose, because it's core to our practice. So it's great, good job, but not really that interesting, definitely not publishable.\"(Laughter)He said, \"I know, Russ. I thought you might say that.\" Nick is smart. \"I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment. I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs, and I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals, for people taking two drugs, where each drug alone did not change glucose, but together I saw a strong signal.\"And I said, \"Oh! You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list.\" And there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting. But what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs: paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant; and pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication.And I said, \"Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs.\" In fact, we learned later, 15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin, and a million, we estimated, on both. So that's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database actually holds up. But I said, \"It's still not publishable, because I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo, with the machine learning, but it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have.\" So we have to do something else. Let's go into the Stanford electronic medical record. We have a copy of it that's OK for research, we removed identifying information. And I said, \"Let's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose.\"Now there are thousands and thousands of people in the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin. But we needed special patients. We needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement, then got the second one and had another glucose measurement, all within a reasonable period of time \u2014 something like two months. And when we did that, we found 10 patients. However, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose when they got the second P \u2014 we call this P and P \u2014 when they got the second P. Either one could be first, the second one comes up, glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter. Just as a reminder, you walk around normally, if you're not diabetic, with a glucose of around 90. And if it gets up to 120, 125, your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes. So a 20 bump \u2014 pretty significant.I said, \"Nick, this is very cool. But, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper, because this is 10 patients and \u2014 give me a break \u2014 it's not enough patients.\"So we said, what can we do? And we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt, who also \u2014 Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville, who also have electronic medical records similar to ours. Let's see if they can find similar patients with the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements in that range that we need.God bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients, same trend. Harvard found 100 patients, same trend. So at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.More interestingly, we had left out diabetics, because diabetics already have messed up glucose. When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20. This was a big deal, and we said, \"We've got to publish this.\" We submitted the paper. It was all data evidence, data from the FDA, data from Stanford, data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard. We had not done a single real experiment.But we were nervous. So Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab. We found somebody who knew about lab stuff. I don't do that. I take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes. They taught us how to feed mice drugs. We took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine. We gave some other mice pravastatin. And we gave a third group of mice both of them. And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice.So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone, but we added a little note at the end, saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up.That was great, and the story could have ended there. But I still have six and a half minutes.(Laughter)So we were sitting around thinking about all of this, and I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said, \"I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia. They could and they should. How would we ever determine that?\"We said, well, what do you do? You're taking a medication, one new medication or two, and you get a funny feeling. What do you do? You go to Google and type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking, and you type in \"side effects.\" What are you experiencing? So we said OK, let's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us, so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches. Google, I am sorry to say, denied our request. So I was bummed. I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research and I said, \"We wanted to do this study, Google said no, it's kind of a bummer.\" He said, \"Well, we have the Bing searches.\"(Laughter)Yeah. That's great. Now I felt like I was \u2014(Laughter)I felt like I was talking to Nick again. He works for one of the largest companies in the world, and I'm already trying to make him feel better. But he said, \"No, Russ \u2014 you might not understand. We not only have Bing searches, but if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google, Yahoo, Bing, any ... Then, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only.\" I said, \"Now you're talking!\" This was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft.So we did a study where we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in if they're having hyperglycemia, like \"fatigue,\" \"loss of appetite,\" \"urinating a lot,\" \"peeing a lot\" \u2014 forgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in. So we had 50 phrases that we called the \"diabetes words.\" And we did first a baseline. And it turns out that about .5 to one percent of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words. So that's our baseline rate. If people type in \"paroxetine\" or \"Paxil\" \u2014 those are synonyms \u2014 and one of those words, the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words, if you already know that there's that \"paroxetine\" word. If it's \"pravastatin,\" the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline. If both \"paroxetine\" and \"pravastatin\" are present in the query, it goes up to 10 percent, a huge three- to four-fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in, and diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words.We published this, and it got some attention. The reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches. We brought this to the attention of the FDA. They were interested. They have set up social media surveillance programs to collaborate with Microsoft, which had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others, to look at Twitter feeds, to look at Facebook feeds, to look at search logs, to try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together, are causing problems.What do I take from this? Why tell this story? Well, first of all, we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really, fundamentally, drug actions. How do drugs work? This will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use. Nick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now. He did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs. He found several very important interactions, and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-drug interactions.However, there's a couple of things. We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time. As I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs. Have they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction? Yes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D, but what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together, being taken by the same patient, perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective or causes side effects that are unexpected? We really have no idea. It's a blue sky, open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs.Two more lessons: I want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists, through themselves, through their doctors, the people who allowed the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt, to be used for research. People are worried about data. They're worried about their privacy and security \u2014 they should be. We need secure systems. But we can't have a system that closes that data off, because it is too rich of a source of inspiration, innovation and discovery for new things in medicine.And the final thing I want to say is, in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story. The two drugs actually caused problems. They increased glucose. They could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes, and so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together, perhaps not together, make different choices when you're prescribing. But there was another possibility. We could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way. We could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone, but together, instead of causing a side effect, they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective. If we think about drug treatment today, all the major breakthroughs \u2014 for HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes \u2014 it's always a cocktail of drugs.And so the upside here, and the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day, is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments, new insights into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better?Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2436, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.090\nSo you go to the doctor\nand get some tests.\n\n00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:19.252\nThe doctor determines\nthat you have high cholesterol\n\n00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:22.447\nand you would benefit\nfrom medication to treat it.\n\n00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.495\nSo you get a pillbox.\n\n00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:26.662\nYou have some confidence,\n\n00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:29.623\nyour physician has some confidence\nthat this is going to work.\n\n00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:33.200\nThe company that invented it did\na lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.\n\n00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:36.331\nThey studied it very carefully,\nskeptically, they approved it.\n\n00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:38.244\nThey have a rough idea of how it works,\n\n00:00:38.268 --> 00:00:40.721\nthey have a rough idea\nof what the side effects are.\n\n00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:41.895\nIt should be OK.\n\n00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:45.640\nYou have a little more\nof a conversation with your physician\n\n00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.627\nand the physician is a little worried\nbecause you've been blue,\n\n00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:49.944\nhaven't felt like yourself,\n\n00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:53.699\nyou haven't been able to enjoy things\nin life quite as much as you usually do.\n\n00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:56.909\nYour physician says, \"You know,\nI think you have some depression.\n\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.065\nI'm going to have to give\nyou another pill.\"\n\n00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:03.375\nSo now we're talking\nabout two medications.\n\n00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.503\nThis pill also -- millions\nof people have taken it,\n\n00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:10.158\nthe company did studies,\nthe FDA looked at it -- all good.\n\n00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:12.838\nThink things should go OK.\n\n00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:15.059\nThink things should go OK.\n\n00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:16.522\nWell, wait a minute.\n\n00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:20.063\nHow much have we studied\nthese two together?\n\n00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:22.888\nWell, it's very hard to do that.\n\n00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:25.042\nIn fact, it's not traditionally done.\n\n00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:30.584\nWe totally depend on what we call\n\"post-marketing surveillance,\"\n\n00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:32.488\nafter the drugs hit the market.\n\n00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.802\nHow can we figure out\nif bad things are happening\n\n00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:37.183\nbetween two medications?\n\n00:01:37.207 --> 00:01:39.237\nThree?

It was very simple, in a way.\n\n00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:26.490\nHe took all the drugs\nthat were known to change glucose\n\n00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:28.903\nand a bunch of drugs\nthat don't change glucose,\n\n00:03:28.927 --> 00:03:31.815\nand said, \"What's the difference\nin their side effects?\n\n00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:36.691\nDifferences in fatigue? In appetite?\nIn urination habits?\"\n\n00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:39.675\nAll those things conspired\nto give him a really good predictor.\n\n00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.247\nHe said, \"Russ, I can predict\nwith 93 percent accuracy\n\n00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:43.843\nwhen a drug will change glucose.\"\n\n00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:45.283\nI said, \"Nick, that's great.\"\n\n00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:48.203\nHe's a young student,\nyou have to build his confidence.\n\n00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.617\n\"But Nick, there's a problem.\n\n00:03:49.641 --> 00:03:53.601\nIt's that every physician in the world\nknows all the drugs that change glucose,\n\n00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:55.663\nbecause it's core to our practice.\n\n00:03:55.687 --> 00:03:59.409\nSo it's great, good job,\nbut not really that interesting,\n\n00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:00.964\ndefinitely not publishable.\"\n\n00:04:00.988 --> 00:04:02.002\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:04.576\nHe said, \"I know, Russ.\nI thought you might say that.\"\n\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.752\nNick is smart.\n\n00:04:06.107 --> 00:04:08.981\n\"I thought you might say that,\nso I did one other experiment.\n\n00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:11.933\nI looked at people in this database\nwho were on two drugs,\n\n00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:16.379\nand I looked for signals similar,\nglucose-changing signals,\n\n00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:18.027\nfor people taking two drugs,\n\n00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:23.620\nwhere each drug alone\ndid not change glucose,\n\n00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:26.104\nbut together I saw a strong signal.\"\n\n00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:29.277\nAnd I said, \"Oh! You're clever.\nGood idea. Show me the list.\"\n\n00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:31.555\nAnd there's a bunch of drugs,\nnot very exciting.\n\n00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:35.511\nBut what caught my eye\nwas, on the list there were two drugs:\n\n00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:38.928\nparoxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;\n\n00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:43.284\nand pravastatin, or Pravachol,\na cholesterol medication.\n\n00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:48.177\nAnd I said, \"Huh. There are millions\nof Americans on those two drugs.\"\n\n00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:49.447\nIn fact, we learned later,\n\n00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:55.503\n15 million Americans on paroxetine\nat the time, 15 million on pravastatin,\n\n00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:58.344\nand a million, we estimated, on both.\n\n00:04:58.725 --> 00:04:59.979\nSo that's a million people\n\n00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:02.456\nwho might be having some problems\nwith their glucose\n\n00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.686\nif this machine-learning mumbo jumbo\nthat he did in the FDA database\n\n00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.964\nactually holds up.\n\n00:05:06.988 --> 00:05:08.915\nBut I said, \"It's still not publishable,\n\n00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.235\nbecause I love what you did\nwith the mumbo jumbo,\n\n00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.505\nwith the machine learning,\n\n00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.393\nbut it's not really standard-of-proof\nevidence that we have.\"\n\n00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:19.165\nSo we have to do something else.\n\n00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.065\nLet's go into the Stanford\nelectronic medical record.\n\n00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.153\nWe have a copy of it\nthat's OK for research,\n\n00:05:24.177 --> 00:05:26.223\nwe removed identifying information.\n\n00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.042\nAnd I said, \"Let's see if people\non these two drugs\n\n00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:30.835\nhave problems with their glucose.\"\n\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.407\nNow there are thousands\nand thousands of people\n\n00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.890\nin the Stanford medical records\nthat take paroxetine and pravastatin.\n\n00:05:36.914 --> 00:05:38.713\nBut we needed special patients.\n\n00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:43.334\nWe needed patients who were on one of them\nand had a glucose measurement,\n\n00:05:43.358 --> 00:05:46.807\nthen got the second one and had\nanother glucose measurement,\n\n00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:50.446\nall within a reasonable period of time --\nsomething like two months.\n\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.629\nAnd when we did that,\nwe found 10 patients.\n\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.088\nHowever, eight out of the 10\nhad a bump in their glucose\n\n00:05:59.112 --> 00:06:01.757\nwhen they got the second P --\nwe call this P and P --\n\n00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:03.091\nwhen they got the second P.\n\n00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:05.677\nEither one could be first,\nthe second one comes up,\n\n00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:08.548\nglucose went up\n20 milligrams per deciliter.\n\n00:06:08.572 --> 00:06:09.730\nJust as a reminder,\n\n00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:12.079\nyou walk around normally,\nif you're not diabetic,\n\n00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:13.462\nwith a glucose of around 90.\n\n00:06:13.486 --> 00:06:15.562\nAnd if it gets up to 120, 125,\n\n00:06:15.586 --> 00:06:19.036\nyour doctor begins to think\nabout a potential diagnosis of diabetes.\n\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.051\nSo a 20 bump -- pretty significant.\n\n00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:24.463\nI said, \"Nick, this is very cool.\n\n00:06:25.574 --> 00:06:27.627\nBut, I'm sorry, we still\ndon't have a paper,\n\n00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.230\nbecause this is 10 patients\nand -- give me a break --\n\n00:06:30.254 --> 00:06:31.499\nit's not enough patients.\"\n\n00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:32.829\nSo we said, what can we do?\n\n00:06:32.853 --> 00:06:35.829\nAnd we said, let's call our friends\nat Harvard and Vanderbilt,\n\n00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:38.440\nwho also -- Harvard in Boston,\nVanderbilt in Nashville,\n\n00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:41.285\nwho also have electronic\nmedical records similar to ours.\n\n00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.329\nLet's see if they can find\nsimilar patients\n\n00:06:43.353 --> 00:06:46.629\nwith the one P, the other P,\nthe glucose measurements\n\n00:06:46.653 --> 00:06:48.253\nin that range that we need.\n\n00:06:48.745 --> 00:06:53.700\nGod bless them, Vanderbilt\nin one week found 40 such patients,\n\n00:06:53.724 --> 00:06:54.913\nsame trend.\n\n00:06:55.762 --> 00:06:59.382\nHarvard found 100 patients, same trend.\n\n00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:03.687\nSo at the end, we had 150 patients\nfrom three diverse medical centers\n\n00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:07.008\nthat were telling us that patients\ngetting these two drugs\n\n00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:09.735\nwere having their glucose bump\nsomewhat significantly.\n\n00:07:10.275 --> 00:07:13.085\nMore interestingly,\nwe had left out diabetics,\n\n00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:15.426\nbecause diabetics already\nhave messed up glucose.\n\n00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.688\nWhen we looked\nat the glucose of diabetics,\n\n00:07:17.712 --> 00:07:21.147\nit was going up 60 milligrams\nper deciliter, not just 20.\n\n00:07:21.718 --> 00:07:25.170\nThis was a big deal, and we said,\n\"We've got to publish this.\"\n\n00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:26.373\nWe submitted the paper.\n\n00:07:26.397 --> 00:07:28.508\nIt was all data evidence,\n\n00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:31.015\ndata from the FDA, data from Stanford,\n\n00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.985\ndata from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.\n\n00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.405\nWe had not done a single real experiment.\n\n00:07:36.453 --> 00:07:37.749\nBut we were nervous.\n\n00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.889\nSo Nick, while the paper\nwas in review, went to the lab.\n\n00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:44.375\nWe found somebody\nwho knew about lab stuff.\n\n00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.792\nI don't do that.\n\n00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:48.233\nI take care of patients,\nbut I don't do pipettes.\n\n00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:52.431\nThey taught us how to feed mice drugs.\n\n00:07:52.822 --> 00:07:55.236\nWe took mice and we gave them\none P, paroxetine.\n\n00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.768\nWe gave some other mice pravastatin.\n\n00:07:57.792 --> 00:08:01.387\nAnd we gave a third group\nof mice both of them.\n\n00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:05.797\nAnd lo and behold, glucose went up\n20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter\n\n00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:06.992\nin the mice.\n\n00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:10.174\nSo the paper was accepted\nbased on the informatics evidence alone,\n\n00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.092\nbut we added a little note at the end,\n\n00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:15.015\nsaying, oh by the way,\nif you give these to mice, it goes up.\n\n00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.547\nThat was great, and the story\ncould have ended there.\n\n00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:19.568\nBut I still have six and a half minutes.\n\n00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:22.399\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:25.238\nSo we were sitting around\nthinking about all of this,\n\n00:08:25.262 --> 00:08:27.997\nand I don't remember who thought\nof it, but somebody said,\n\n00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:31.222\n\"I wonder if patients\nwho are taking these two drugs\n\n00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:34.799\nare noticing side effects\nof hyperglycemia.\n\n00:08:34.823 --> 00:08:36.319\nThey could and they should.\n\n00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.596\nHow would we ever determine that?\"\n\n00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:40.952\nWe said, well, what do you do?\n\n00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:43.556\nYou're taking a medication,\none new medication or two,\n\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.118\nand you get a funny feeling.\n\n00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:46.293\nWhat do you do?\n\n00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.468\nYou go to Google\n\n00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:50.841\nand type in the two drugs you're taking\nor the one drug you're taking,\n\n00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:52.468\nand you type in \"side effects.\"\n\n00:08:52.492 --> 00:08:53.848\nWhat are you experiencing?\n\n00:08:54.197 --> 00:08:55.348\nSo we said OK,\n\n00:08:55.372 --> 00:08:58.428\nlet's ask Google if they will share\ntheir search logs with us,\n\n00:08:58.452 --> 00:09:00.285\nso that we can look at the search logs\n\n00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:02.874\nand see if patients are doing\nthese kinds of searches.\n\n00:09:02.898 --> 00:09:06.173\nGoogle, I am sorry to say,\ndenied our request.\n\n00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:07.928\nSo I was bummed.\n\n00:09:07.952 --> 00:09:11.118\nI was at a dinner with a colleague\nwho works at Microsoft Research\n\n00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:13.083\nand I said, \"We wanted to do this study,\n\n00:09:13.107 --> 00:09:14.987\nGoogle said no, it's kind of a bummer.\"\n\n00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:17.097\nHe said, \"Well, we have\nthe Bing searches.\"\n\n00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:21.636\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:24.030\nYeah.\n\n00:09:24.054 --> 00:09:25.205\nThat's great.\n\n00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:26.380\nNow I felt like I was --\n\n00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:27.404\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:27.428 --> 00:09:29.840\nI felt like I was talking to Nick again.\n\n00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:33.019\nHe works for one of the largest\ncompanies in the world,\n\n00:09:33.043 --> 00:09:35.249\nand I'm already trying\nto make him feel better.\n\n00:09:35.273 --> 00:09:37.718\nBut he said, \"No, Russ --\nyou might not understand.\n\n00:09:37.742 --> 00:09:39.242\nWe not only have Bing searches,\n\n00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:42.606\nbut if you use Internet Explorer\nto do searches at Google,\n\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.521\nYahoo, Bing, any ...\n\n00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:48.188\nThen, for 18 months, we keep that data\nfor research purposes only.\"\n\n00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:50.148\nI said, \"Now you're talking!\"\n\n00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:52.370\nThis was Eric Horvitz,\nmy friend at Microsoft.\n\n00:09:52.394 --> 00:09:54.089\nSo we did a study\n\n00:09:54.113 --> 00:09:58.732\nwhere we defined 50 words\nthat a regular person might type in\n\n00:09:58.756 --> 00:10:00.358\nif they're having hyperglycemia,\n\n00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:05.144\nlike \"fatigue,\" \"loss of appetite,\"\n\"urinating a lot,\" \"peeing a lot\" --\n\n00:10:05.168 --> 00:10:07.935\nforgive me, but that's one\nof the things you might type in.\n\n00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:10.749\nSo we had 50 phrases\nthat we called the \"diabetes words.\"\n\n00:10:10.773 --> 00:10:12.836\nAnd we did first a baseline.\n\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.564\nAnd it turns out\nthat about .5 to one percent\n\n00:10:15.588 --> 00:10:18.570\nof all searches on the Internet\ninvolve one of those words.\n\n00:10:18.594 --> 00:10:20.336\nSo that's our baseline rate.\n\n00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.503\nIf people type in \"paroxetine\"\nor \"Paxil\" -- those are synonyms --\n\n00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:25.742\nand one of those words,\n\n00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:30.656\nthe rate goes up to about two percent\nof diabetes-type words,\n\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.724\nif you already know\nthat there's that \"paroxetine\" word.\n\n00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:38.696\nIf it's \"pravastatin,\" the rate goes up\nto about three percent from the baseline.\n\n00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:43.519\nIf both \"paroxetine\" and \"pravastatin\"\nare present in the query,\n\n00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:45.212\nit goes up to 10 percent,\n\n00:10:45.236 --> 00:10:48.697\na huge three- to four-fold increase\n\n00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:52.110\nin those searches with the two drugs\nthat we were interested in,\n\n00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:55.700\nand diabetes-type words\nor hyperglycemia-type words.\n\n00:10:56.174 --> 00:10:57.439\nWe published this,\n\n00:10:57.463 --> 00:10:58.929\nand it got some attention.\n\n00:10:58.953 --> 00:11:00.731\nThe reason it deserves attention\n\n00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:05.067\nis that patients are telling us\ntheir side effects indirectly\n\n00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:06.247\nthrough their searches.\n\n00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:08.409\nWe brought this\nto the attention of the FDA.\n\n00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:09.702\nThey were interested.\n\n00:11:09.726 --> 00:11:13.332\nThey have set up social media\nsurveillance programs\n\n00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:15.107\nto collaborate with Microsoft,\n\n00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:17.925\nwhich had a nice infrastructure\nfor doing this, and others,\n\n00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:19.231\nto look at Twitter feeds,\n\n00:11:19.255 --> 00:11:20.971\nto look at Facebook feeds,\n\n00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:22.306\nto look at search logs,\n\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.239\nto try to see early signs that drugs,\neither individually or together,\n\n00:11:27.263 --> 00:11:28.852\nare causing problems.\n\n00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:31.050\nWhat do I take from this?\nWhy tell this story?\n\n00:11:31.074 --> 00:11:32.281\nWell, first of all,\n\n00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:36.342\nwe have now the promise\nof big data and medium-sized data\n\n00:11:36.366 --> 00:11:39.284\nto help us understand drug interactions\n\n00:11:39.308 --> 00:11:41.728\nand really, fundamentally, drug actions.\n\n00:11:41.752 --> 00:11:43.165\nHow do drugs work?\n\n00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:46.025\nThis will create and has created\na new ecosystem\n\n00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:49.316\nfor understanding how drugs work\nand to optimize their use.\n\n00:11:50.261 --> 00:11:52.920\nNick went on; he's a professor\nat Columbia now.\n\n00:11:52.944 --> 00:11:57.016\nHe did this in his PhD\nfor hundreds of pairs of drugs.\n\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.557\nHe found several\nvery important interactions,\n\n00:11:59.581 --> 00:12:00.795\nand so we replicated this\n\n00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:03.393\nand we showed that this\nis a way that really works\n\n00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:05.756\nfor finding drug-drug interactions.\n\n00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.974\nHowever, there's a couple of things.\n\n00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:11.044\nWe don't just use pairs\nof drugs at a time.\n\n00:12:11.068 --> 00:12:15.537\nAs I said before, there are patients\non three, five, seven, nine drugs.\n\n00:12:15.939 --> 00:12:19.581\nHave they been studied with respect\nto their nine-way interaction?\n\n00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:23.813\nYes, we can do pair-wise,\nA and B, A and C, A and D,\n\n00:12:23.837 --> 00:12:28.123\nbut what about A, B, C,\nD, E, F, G all together,\n\n00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:29.909\nbeing taken by the same patient,\n\n00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:32.051\nperhaps interacting with each other\n\n00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:35.853\nin ways that either makes them\nmore effective or less effective\n\n00:12:35.877 --> 00:12:38.209\nor causes side effects\nthat are unexpected?\n\n00:12:38.233 --> 00:12:40.060\nWe really have no idea.\n\n00:12:40.084 --> 00:12:43.840\nIt's a blue sky, open field\nfor us to use data\n\n00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:46.366\nto try to understand\nthe interaction of drugs.\n\n00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:48.176\nTwo more lessons:\n\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.399\nI want you to think about the power\nthat we were able to generate\n\n00:12:52.423 --> 00:12:57.134\nwith the data from people who had\nvolunteered their adverse reactions\n\n00:12:57.158 --> 00:13:00.427\nthrough their pharmacists,\nthrough themselves, through their doctors,\n\n00:13:00.451 --> 00:13:04.118\nthe people who allowed the databases\nat Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt,\n\n00:13:04.142 --> 00:13:05.569\nto be used for research.\n\n00:13:05.887 --> 00:13:07.332\nPeople are worried about data.\n\n00:13:07.356 --> 00:13:10.543\nThey're worried about their privacy\nand security -- they should be.\n\n00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:11.718\nWe need secure systems.\n\n00:13:11.742 --> 00:13:15.148\nBut we can't have a system\nthat closes that data off,\n\n00:13:15.172 --> 00:13:17.924\nbecause it is too rich of a source\n\n00:13:17.948 --> 00:13:21.919\nof inspiration, innovation and discovery\n\n00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:23.521\nfor new things in medicine.\n\n00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:26.246\nAnd the final thing I want to say is,\n\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.627\nin this case we found two drugs\nand it was a little bit of a sad story.\n\n00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:31.572\nThe two drugs actually caused problems.\n\n00:13:31.596 --> 00:13:33.071\nThey increased glucose.\n\n00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:35.541\nThey could throw somebody into diabetes\n\n00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.859\nwho would otherwise not be in diabetes,\n\n00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:41.058\nand so you would want to use\nthe two drugs very carefully together,\n\n00:13:41.082 --> 00:13:42.233\nperhaps not together,\n\n00:13:42.257 --> 00:13:44.597\nmake different choices\nwhen you're prescribing.\n\n00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:46.467\nBut there was another possibility.\n\n00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:48.835\nWe could have found\ntwo drugs or three drugs\n\n00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:51.120\nthat were interacting in a beneficial way.\n\n00:13:51.574 --> 00:13:54.286\nWe could have found new effects of drugs\n\n00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.470\nthat neither of them has alone,\n\n00:13:56.494 --> 00:13:58.987\nbut together, instead\nof causing a side effect,\n\n00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:01.436\nthey could be a new and novel treatment\n\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.342\nfor diseases that don't have treatments\n\n00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:05.373\nor where the treatments are not effective.\n\n00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:07.792\nIf we think about drug treatment today,\n\n00:14:07.816 --> 00:14:09.568\nall the major breakthroughs --\n\n00:14:09.592 --> 00:14:13.889\nfor HIV, for tuberculosis,\nfor depression, for diabetes --\n\n00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:16.743\nit's always a cocktail of drugs.\n\n00:14:16.767 --> 00:14:18.497\nAnd so the upside here,\n\n00:14:18.521 --> 00:14:21.370\nand the subject for a different\nTED Talk on a different day,\n\n00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:23.987\nis how can we use the same data sources\n\n00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:27.574\nto find good effects\nof drugs in combination\n\n00:14:27.598 --> 00:14:29.773\nthat will provide us new treatments,\n\n00:14:29.797 --> 00:14:31.649\nnew insights into how drugs work\n\n00:14:31.673 --> 00:14:35.459\nand enable us to take care\nof our patients even better?\n\n00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:36.649\nThank you very much.\n\n00:14:36.673 --> 00:14:40.172\n(Applause)"},

Here's how we can fix it", "duration": "1089", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/alexander_betts_our_refugee_system_is_failing_here_s_how_we_can_fix_it", "transcript": "There are times when I feel really quite ashamed to be a European. In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.There are just so many contradictions. We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean. We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined. We lament the existence of human smugglers, and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe. We have labor shortages, and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe. We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, and yet \u2014 we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers, that separate children from their families, and that seize property from refugees.What are we doing? How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care. I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world. And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask. First, why is the current system not working? And second, what can we do to fix it?So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys. Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home. It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today. Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution.But today, that system is failing. In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum. In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety. In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from. But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo. In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility. In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees. The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong. It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that's what we need to reconsider.So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works. How does the refugee regime actually work? But not from a top-down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee. So imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira. And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region. Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you, Homs, a once beautiful and historic city now under rubble. And so Amira can't go back there. But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice. They have three basic options. The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp. In the camp, she might get assistance, but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family. Camps are in bleak, arid locations, often in the desert. In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime. There's restricted economic activity. Education is often of poor quality. And around the world, some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years. It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians choose that option.Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut. That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken. But there, there's great difficulty as well. Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work. They don't usually get significant access to assistance. And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.So there's a third alternative, and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking. Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys. For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today. But I think it's a false choice. I think we can reconsider that choice. The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees, and they're not. Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens. We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society. But they don't have to. They can contribute.So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else: the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves. And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees. All four ways have one thing in common: they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue.The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances. Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees. We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries. It's not. It's exceptional. Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity. It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement. And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community. In the capital city, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country. In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country. Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses. We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions. Against the odds of extreme constraint, refugees are innovating, and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay. Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a filmmaker. So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's now making films. He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little. It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees. Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are all important in the emergency phase, but we need to also look beyond that. We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking. All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees.The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones. Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken. Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way. But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy. The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals. And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area. The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lacked two things: access to labor and inward investment. So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps, able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria? We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing. It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs. King Abdullah has picked up on the idea. It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago, and a pilot will begin in the summer.(Applause)The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee. What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off. The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets, ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match. My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees, to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations, but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match. Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching. The matching idea has been successfully used to match, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney donors with patients, and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites. So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?It could also be used at the national level, where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees. And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all. So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves.The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas. Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable. It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: that in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described. But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities? They're completely unnecessary journeys, and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on Europe's borders and within European territory.If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that, and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa, that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to Europe. It costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands. It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt. If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages. It would save lives, it would undercut the entire market for smugglers, and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands. It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.And this is an idea that has been applied. Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil. And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.There is a historical precedent for it as well. Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe. And the Nansen International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a viable strategy.So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set. They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic, impossible three options I explained to you and still leave others better off.In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden. There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost. Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions \u2014 if we let them.In the new world, migration is not going to go away. What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years. People will continue to travel, they'll continue to be displaced, and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this \u2014 not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance, not based on logics of charity, but building on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility. I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2449, "subtitle":

00:00:53.694\nand yet we accept that tiny Lebanon\n\n00:00:53.718 --> 00:00:57.358\nhosts more Syrians\nthan the whole of Europe combined.\n\n00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:01.678\nWe lament the existence\nof human smugglers,\n\n00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:05.734\nand yet we make that the only viable route\n\n00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:07.838\nto seek asylum in Europe.\n\n00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:10.654\nWe have labor shortages,\n\n00:01:10.678 --> 00:01:16.134\nand yet we exclude people who fit\nour economic and demographic needs\n\n00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:17.998\nfrom coming to Europe.\n\n00:01:18.958 -->

adopted such an inhumane\nresponse to a humanitarian crisis?\n\n00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:53.654\nI don't believe\nit's because people don't care,\n\n00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:56.854\nor at least I don't want to believe\nit's because people don't care.\n\n00:01:56.878 --> 00:02:00.694\nI believe it's because\nour politicians lack a vision,\n\n00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:04.334\na vision for how to adapt\nan international refugee system\n\n00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.494\ncreated over 50 years ago\n\n00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:09.318\nfor a changing and globalized world.\n\n00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:12.294\nAnd so what I want to do\nis take a step back\n\n00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:15.734\nand ask two really fundamental questions,\n\n00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:18.214\nthe two questions we all need to ask.\n\n00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.534\nFirst, why is the current\nsystem not working?\n\n00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd second, what can we do to fix it?\n\n00:02:26.718 --> 00:02:28.774\nSo the modern refugee regime\n\n00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:32.878\nwas created in the aftermath\nof the Second World War by these guys.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.094\nIts basic aim is to ensure\n\n00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:41.334\nthat when a state fails,\nor worse, turns against its own people,\n\n00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:42.934\npeople have somewhere to go,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.614\nto live in safety and dignity\nuntil they can go home.\n\n00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:51.918\nIt was created precisely for situations\nlike the situation we see in Syria today.\n\n00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:57.494\nThrough an international convention\nsigned by 147 governments,\n\n00:02:57.518 --> 00:03:00.534\nthe 1951 Convention\non the Status of Refugees,\n\n00:03:00.558 --> 00:03:03.734\nand an international organization, UNHCR,\n\n00:03:03.758 --> 00:03:08.534\nstates committed to reciprocally\nadmit people onto their territory\n\n00:03:08.558 --> 00:03:11.078\nwho flee conflict and persecution.\n\n00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:14.238\nBut today, that system is failing.\n\n00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:18.318\nIn theory, refugees\nhave a right to seek asylum.\n\n00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:22.798\nIn practice, our immigration policies\nblock the path to safety.\n\n00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:27.574\nIn theory, refugees have a right\nto a pathway to integration,\n\n00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:29.638\nor return to the country\nthey've come from.\n\n00:03:30.318 --> 00:03:33.558\nBut in practice, they get stuck\nin almost indefinite limbo.\n\n00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:37.278\nIn theory, refugees\nare a shared global responsibility.\n\n00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:42.334\nIn practice, geography means\nthat countries proximate the conflict\n\n00:03:42.358 --> 00:03:45.958\ntake the overwhelming majority\nof the world's refugees.\n\n00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:49.414\nThe system isn't broken\nbecause the rules are wrong.\n\n00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:53.358\nIt's that we're not applying them\nadequately to a changing world,\n\n00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:55.798\nand that's what we need to reconsider.\n\n00:03:56.398 --> 00:04:00.894\nSo I want to explain to you a little bit\nabout how the current system works.\n\n00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:03.078\nHow does the refugee regime actually work?\n\n00:04:03.518 --> 00:04:06.294\nBut not from a top-down\ninstitutional perspective,\n\n00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:09.638\nrather from the perspective of a refugee.\n\n00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:12.654\nSo imagine a Syrian woman.\n\n00:04:12.678 --> 00:04:14.278\nLet's call her Amira.\n\n00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:18.718\nAnd Amira to me represents\nmany of the people I've met in the region.\n\n00:04:19.518 --> 00:04:22.854\nAmira, like around 25 percent\nof the world's refugees,\n\n00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:24.158\nis a woman with children,\n\n00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:28.054\nand she can't go home\nbecause she comes from this city\n\n00:04:28.078 --> 00:04:30.094\nthat you see before you, Homs,\n\n00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:32.854\na once beautiful and historic city\n\n00:04:32.878 --> 00:04:34.374\nnow under rubble.\n\n00:04:34.398 --> 00:04:36.238\nAnd so Amira can't go back there.\n\n00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:41.294\nBut Amira also has no hope\nof resettlement to a third country,\n\n00:04:41.318 --> 00:04:42.814\nbecause that's a lottery ticket\n\n00:04:42.838 --> 00:04:46.278\nonly available to less than one percent\nof the world's refugees.\n\n00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:49.094\nSo Amira and her family\n\n00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:51.294\nface an almost impossible choice.\n\n00:04:51.318 --> 00:04:53.718\nThey have three basic options.\n\n00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:59.478\nThe first option is that Amira\ncan take her family to a camp.\n\n00:05:00.478 --> 00:05:02.638\nIn the camp, she might get assistance,\n\n00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:06.814\nbut there are very few prospects\nfor Amira and her family.\n\n00:05:06.838 --> 00:05:10.094\nCamps are in bleak, arid locations,\n\n00:05:10.118 --> 00:05:11.358\noften in the desert.\n\n00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:14.694\nIn the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,\n\n00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:19.118\nyou can hear the shells\nacross the border in Syria at nighttime.\n\n00:05:20.558 --> 00:05:23.134\nThere's restricted economic activity.\n\n00:05:23.158 --> 00:05:25.318\nEducation is often of poor quality.\n\n00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:27.254\nAnd around the world,\n\n00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:30.374\nsome 80 percent of refugees\nwho are in camps\n\n00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:32.934\nhave to stay for at least five years.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.854\nIt's a miserable existence,\n\n00:05:34.878 --> 00:05:37.254\nand that's probably why, in reality,\n\n00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:39.878\nonly nine percent of Syrians\nchoose that option.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.934\nAlternatively, Amira can head\nto an urban area\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.998\nin a neighboring country,\nlike Amman or Beirut.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.998\nThat's an option that about 75 percent\nof Syrian refugees have taken.\n\n00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:56.878\nBut there, there's\ngreat difficulty as well.\n\n00:05:57.678 --> 00:06:01.974\nRefugees in such urban areas\ndon't usually have the right to work.\n\n00:06:01.998 --> 00:06:04.958\nThey don't usually get\nsignificant access to assistance.\n\n00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:09.094\nAnd so when Amira and her family\nhave used up their basic savings,\n\n00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:12.798\nthey're left with very little\nand likely to face urban destitution.\n\n00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:16.078\nSo there's a third alternative,\n\n00:06:16.878 --> 00:06:20.598\nand it's one that increasing\nnumbers of Syrians are taking.\n\n00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.974\nAmira can seek some hope for her family\n\n00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:29.734\nby risking their lives\non a dangerous and perilous journey\n\n00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:31.254\nto another country,\n\n00:06:31.278 --> 00:06:34.798\nand it's that which we're seeing\nin Europe today.\n\n00:06:35.398 --> 00:06:40.654\nAround the world, we present refugees\nwith an almost impossible choice\n\n00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:42.494\nbetween three options:\n\n00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:46.718\nencampment, urban destitution\nand dangerous journeys.\n\n00:06:47.478 --> 00:06:51.798\nFor refugees, that choice is\nthe global refugee regime today.\n\n00:06:52.558 --> 00:06:54.198\nBut I think it's a false choice.\n\n00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:56.798\nI think we can reconsider that choice.\n\n00:06:57.398 --> 00:07:00.758\nThe reason why we limit those options\n\n00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:04.478\nis because we think\n\n00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:09.414\nthat those are the only options\nthat are available to refugees,\n\n00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:10.638\nand they're not.\n\n00:07:11.078 --> 00:07:14.574\nPoliticians frame the issue\nas a zero-sum issue,\n\n00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:18.534\nthat if we benefit refugees,\nwe're imposing costs on citizens.\n\n00:07:18.558 --> 00:07:20.614\nWe tend to have a collective assumption\n\n00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:24.294\nthat refugees are an inevitable cost\nor burden to society.\n\n00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:26.398\nBut they don't have to.\nThey can contribute.\n\n00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:28.254\nSo what I want to argue\n\n00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:31.254\nis there are ways in which we can\nexpand that choice set\n\n00:07:31.278 --> 00:07:33.294\nand still benefit everyone else:\n\n00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:35.174\nthe host states and communities,\n\n00:07:35.198 --> 00:07:38.518\nour societies and refugees themselves.\n\n00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:41.014\nAnd I want to suggest four ways\n\n00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:44.878\nwe can transform the paradigm\nof how we think about refugees.\n\n00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:47.918\nAll four ways have one thing in common:\n\n00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:52.174\nthey're all ways in which we take\nthe opportunities of globalization,\n\n00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:54.254\nmobility and markets,\n\n00:07:54.278 --> 00:07:57.518\nand update the way we think\nabout the refugee issue.\n\n00:07:58.238 --> 00:07:59.934\nThe first one I want to think about\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nis the idea of enabling environments,\n\n00:08:02.678 --> 00:08:05.534\nand it starts from\na very basic recognition\n\n00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:08.254\nthat refugees are human beings\nlike everyone else,\n\n00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:10.678\nbut they're just\nin extraordinary circumstances.\n\n00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:13.214\nTogether with my colleagues in Oxford,\n\n00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:15.894\nwe've embarked on\na research project in Uganda\n\n00:08:15.918 --> 00:08:18.958\nlooking at the economic lives of refugees.\n\n00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:23.854\nWe chose Uganda not because\nit's representative of all host countries.\n\n00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.358\nIt's not. It's exceptional.\n\n00:08:25.918 --> 00:08:28.294\nUnlike most host countries\naround the world,\n\n00:08:28.318 --> 00:08:29.774\nwhat Uganda has done\n\n00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:32.174\nis give refugees economic opportunity.\n\n00:08:32.198 --> 00:08:35.558\nIt gives them the right to work.\nIt gives them freedom of movement.\n\n00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:39.054\nAnd the results of that are extraordinary\n\n00:08:39.078 --> 00:08:41.678\nboth for refugees and the host community.\n\n00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:44.414\nIn the capital city, Kampala,\n\n00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:49.853\nwe found that 21 percent of refugees\nown a business that employs other people,\n\n00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:52.334\nand 40 percent of those employees\n\n00:08:52.358 --> 00:08:54.334\nare nationals of the host country.\n\n00:08:54.358 --> 00:08:56.534\nIn other words, refugees are making jobs\n\n00:08:56.558 --> 00:08:59.198\nfor citizens of the host country.\n\n00:08:59.878 --> 00:09:03.214\nEven in the camps,\nwe found extraordinary examples\n\n00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:06.798\nof vibrant, flourishing\nand entrepreneurial businesses.\n\n00:09:07.758 --> 00:09:11.094\nFor example, in a settlement\ncalled Nakivale,\n\n00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:14.094\nwe found examples of Congolese refugees\n\n00:09:14.118 --> 00:09:16.654\nrunning digital music exchange businesses.\n\n00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:20.454\nWe found a Rwandan\nwho runs a business that's available\n\n00:09:20.478 --> 00:09:23.214\nto allow the youth to play computer games\n\n00:09:23.238 --> 00:09:26.998\non recycled games consoles\nand recycled televisions.\n\n00:09:28.398 --> 00:09:31.214\nAgainst the odds of extreme constraint,\n\n00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:32.558\nrefugees are innovating,\n\n00:09:33.278 --> 00:09:36.707\nand the gentleman you see before you\nis a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.\n\n00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:40.814\nDemou-Kay arrived\nin the settlement with very little,\n\n00:09:40.838 --> 00:09:43.134\nbut he wanted to be a filmmaker.\n\n00:09:43.158 --> 00:09:47.094\nSo with friends and colleagues,\nhe started a community radio station,\n\n00:09:47.118 --> 00:09:48.854\nhe rented a video camera,\n\n00:09:48.878 --> 00:09:50.374\nand he's now making films.\n\n00:09:50.398 --> 00:09:52.374\nHe made two documentary films\n\n00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:54.374\nwith and for our team,\n\n00:09:54.398 --> 00:09:57.718\nand he's making a successful business\nout of very little.\n\n00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.574\nIt's those kinds of examples\n\n00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:03.334\nthat should guide\nour response to refugees.\n\n00:10:03.358 --> 00:10:04.694\nRather than seeing refugees\n\n00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:07.974\nas inevitably dependent\nupon humanitarian assistance,\n\n00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:11.398\nwe need to provide them\nwith opportunities for human flourishing.\n\n00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:16.384\nYes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food\n\n00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:19.174\nare all important in the emergency phase,\n\n00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:21.798\nbut we need to also look beyond that.\n\n00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:26.494\nWe need to provide opportunities\nto connectivity, electricity,\n\n00:10:26.518 --> 00:10:28.798\neducation, the right to work,\n\n00:10:29.358 --> 00:10:31.078\naccess to capital and banking.\n\n00:10:31.518 --> 00:10:33.654\nAll the ways in which we take for granted\n\n00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:35.814\nthat we are plugged in\nto the global economy\n\n00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:38.398\ncan and should apply to refugees.\n\n00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:42.718\nThe second idea I want to discuss\nis economic zones.\n\n00:10:43.278 --> 00:10:46.014\nUnfortunately, not every\nhost country in the world\n\n00:10:46.038 --> 00:10:48.078\ntakes the approach Uganda has taken.\n\n00:10:48.438 --> 00:10:51.774\nMost host countries don't open up\ntheir economies to refugees\n\n00:10:51.798 --> 00:10:52.998\nin the same way.\n\n00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:57.918\nBut there are still pragmatic\nalternative options that we can use.\n\n00:10:59.118 --> 00:11:01.654\nLast April, I traveled to Jordan\nwith my colleague,\n\n00:11:01.678 --> 00:11:03.638\nthe development economist Paul Collier,\n\n00:11:04.358 --> 00:11:07.214\nand we brainstormed an idea\nwhile we were there\n\n00:11:07.238 --> 00:11:09.694\nwith the international community\nand the government,\n\n00:11:09.718 --> 00:11:12.054\nan idea to bring jobs to Syrians\n\n00:11:12.078 --> 00:11:15.694\nwhile supporting Jordan's\nnational development strategy.\n\n00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:18.518\nThe idea is for an economic zone,\n\n00:11:19.038 --> 00:11:22.574\none in which we could potentially\nintegrate the employment of refugees\n\n00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:26.078\nalongside the employment\nof Jordanian host nationals.\n\n00:11:26.798 --> 00:11:30.214\nAnd just 15 minutes away\nfrom the Zaatari refugee camp,\n\n00:11:30.238 --> 00:11:32.374\nhome to 83,000 refugees,\n\n00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:34.414\nis an existing economic zone\n\n00:11:34.438 --> 00:11:37.158\ncalled the King Hussein\nBin Talal Development Area.\n\n00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:40.654\nThe government has spent\nover a hundred million dollars\n\n00:11:40.678 --> 00:11:44.494\nconnecting it to the electricity grid,\nconnecting it to the road network,\n\n00:11:44.518 --> 00:11:46.134\nbut it lacked two things:\n\n00:11:46.158 --> 00:11:48.894\naccess to labor and inward investment.\n\n00:11:48.918 --> 00:11:51.814\nSo what if refugees\nwere able to work there\n\n00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:53.654\nrather than being stuck in camps,\n\n00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:57.694\nable to support their families and develop\nskills through vocational training\n\n00:11:57.718 --> 00:11:59.158\nbefore they go back to Syria?\n\n00:11:59.798 --> 00:12:02.094\nWe recognized that\nthat could benefit Jordan,\n\n00:12:02.118 --> 00:12:04.894\nwhose development strategy\nrequires it to make the leap\n\n00:12:04.918 --> 00:12:07.734\nas a middle income country\nto manufacturing.\n\n00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:11.454\nIt could benefit refugees,\nbut it could also contribute\n\n00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:13.854\nto the postconflict\nreconstruction of Syria\n\n00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:16.654\nby recognizing that we need\nto incubate refugees\n\n00:12:16.678 --> 00:12:20.238\nas the best source\nof eventually rebuilding Syria.\n\n00:12:20.718 --> 00:12:23.774\nWe published the idea\nin the journal Foreign Affairs.\n\n00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:26.014\nKing Abdullah has picked up on the idea.\n\n00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:29.014\nIt was announced at the London\nSyria Conference two weeks ago,\n\n00:12:29.038 --> 00:12:31.638\nand a pilot will begin in the summer.\n\n00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:35.678\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:37.078 --> 00:12:39.774\nThe third idea that I want to put to you\n\n00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:43.414\nis preference matching\nbetween states and refugees\n\n00:12:43.438 --> 00:12:46.574\nto lead to the kinds of happy outcomes\nyou see here in the selfie\n\n00:12:46.598 --> 00:12:49.478\nfeaturing Angela Merkel\nand a Syrian refugee.\n\n00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:54.398\nWhat we rarely do is ask refugees\nwhat they want, where they want to go,\n\n00:12:54.918 --> 00:12:56.774\nbut I'd argue we can do that\n\n00:12:56.798 --> 00:12:58.878\nand still make everyone better off.\n\n00:12:59.598 --> 00:13:03.734\nThe economist Alvin Roth has developed\nthe idea of matching markets,\n\n00:13:03.758 --> 00:13:08.998\nways in which the preference ranking\nof the parties shapes an eventual match.\n\n00:13:09.678 --> 00:13:12.734\nMy colleagues Will Jones\nand Alex Teytelboym\n\n00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:16.894\nhave explored ways in which that idea\ncould be applied to refugees,\n\n00:13:16.918 --> 00:13:20.454\nto ask refugees to rank\ntheir preferred destinations,\n\n00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:24.254\nbut also allow states to rank\nthe types of refugees they want\n\n00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:27.094\non skills criteria or language criteria\n\n00:13:27.118 --> 00:13:28.814\nand allow those to match.\n\n00:13:28.838 --> 00:13:30.934\nNow, of course\nyou'd need to build in quotas\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.214\non things like diversity\nand vulnerability,\n\n00:13:34.238 --> 00:13:37.774\nbut it's a way of increasing\nthe possibilities of matching.\n\n00:13:37.798 --> 00:13:40.294\nThe matching idea\nhas been successfully used\n\n00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:45.454\nto match, for instance,\nstudents with university places,\n\n00:13:45.478 --> 00:13:47.974\nto match kidney donors with patients,\n\n00:13:47.998 --> 00:13:52.134\nand it underlies the kind of algorithms\nthat exist on dating websites.\n\n00:13:52.158 --> 00:13:55.254\nSo why not apply that\nto give refugees greater choice?\n\n00:13:55.278 --> 00:13:57.326\nIt could also be used\nat the national level,\n\n00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.334\nwhere one of the great challenges we face\n\n00:13:59.358 --> 00:14:03.094\nis to persuade local communities\nto accept refugees.\n\n00:14:03.118 --> 00:14:05.574\nAnd at the moment,\nin my country, for instance,\n\n00:14:05.598 --> 00:14:09.774\nwe often send engineers to rural areas\nand farmers to the cities,\n\n00:14:09.798 --> 00:14:11.654\nwhich makes no sense at all.\n\n00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:16.254\nSo matching markets offer a potential way\nto bring those preferences together\n\n00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:20.214\nand listen to the needs and demands\nof the populations that host\n\n00:14:20.238 --> 00:14:22.078\nand the refugees themselves.\n\n00:14:22.798 --> 00:14:26.518\nThe fourth idea I want to put to you\nis of humanitarian visas.\n\n00:14:27.198 --> 00:14:29.894\nMuch of the tragedy and chaos\nwe've seen in Europe\n\n00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:31.918\nwas entirely avoidable.\n\n00:14:32.358 --> 00:14:36.454\nIt stems from a fundamental contradiction\nin Europe's asylum policy,\n\n00:14:36.478 --> 00:14:37.854\nwhich is the following:\n\n00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:40.374\nthat in order to seek asylum in Europe,\n\n00:14:40.398 --> 00:14:45.414\nyou have to arrive spontaneously\nby embarking on those dangerous journeys\n\n00:14:45.438 --> 00:14:46.638\nthat I described.\n\n00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:52.214\nBut why should those journeys be necessary\nin an era of the budget airline\n\n00:14:52.238 --> 00:14:54.654\nand modern consular capabilities?\n\n00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:57.014\nThey're completely unnecessary journeys,\n\n00:14:57.038 --> 00:15:00.814\nand last year, they led to the deaths\nof over 3,000 people\n\n00:15:00.838 --> 00:15:04.318\non Europe's borders\nand within European territory.\n\n00:15:05.318 --> 00:15:06.934\nIf refugees were simply allowed\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.734\nto travel directly\nand seek asylum in Europe,\n\n00:15:09.758 --> 00:15:11.054\nwe would avoid that,\n\n00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:12.614\nand there's a way of doing that\n\n00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:14.934\nthrough something\ncalled a humanitarian visa,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.494\nthat allows people\nto collect a visa at an embassy\n\n00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:20.654\nor a consulate in a neighboring country\n\n00:15:20.678 --> 00:15:22.574\nand then simply pay their own way\n\n00:15:22.598 --> 00:15:25.158\nthrough a ferry or a flight to Europe.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.934\nIt costs around a thousand euros\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.374\nto take a smuggler\nfrom Turkey to the Greek islands.\n\n00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:36.854\nIt costs 200 euros to take a budget\nairline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.\n\n00:15:36.878 --> 00:15:40.654\nIf we allowed refugees to do that,\nit would have major advantages.\n\n00:15:40.678 --> 00:15:41.958\nIt would save lives,\n\n00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:46.654\nit would undercut\nthe entire market for smugglers,\n\n00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:50.014\nand it would remove the chaos\nwe see from Europe's front line\n\n00:15:50.038 --> 00:15:52.094\nin areas like the Greek islands.\n\n00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:56.358\nIt's politics that prevents us doing that\nrather than a rational solution.\n\n00:15:56.838 --> 00:15:59.174\nAnd this is an idea that has been applied.\n\n00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:01.854\nBrazil has adopted a pioneering approach\n\n00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:06.174\nwhere over 2,000 Syrians\nhave been able to get humanitarian visas,\n\n00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:10.574\nenter Brazil, and claim refugee status\non arrival in Brazil.\n\n00:16:10.598 --> 00:16:13.494\nAnd in that scheme,\nevery Syrian who has gone through it\n\n00:16:13.518 --> 00:16:17.478\nhas received refugee status\nand been recognized as a genuine refugee.\n\n00:16:18.118 --> 00:16:20.358\nThere is a historical precedent\nfor it as well.\n\n00:16:20.878 --> 00:16:24.214\nBetween 1922 and 1942,\n\n00:16:24.238 --> 00:16:28.014\nthese Nansen passports\nwere used as travel documents\n\n00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:33.574\nto allow 450,000 Assyrians,\nTurks and Chechens\n\n00:16:33.598 --> 00:16:35.094\nto travel across Europe\n\n00:16:35.118 --> 00:16:37.878\nand claim refugee status\nelsewhere in Europe.\n\n00:16:38.478 --> 00:16:41.214\nAnd the Nansen\nInternational Refugee Office\n\n00:16:41.238 --> 00:16:43.094\nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize\n\n00:16:43.118 --> 00:16:46.078\nin recognition of this\nbeing a viable strategy.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:50.174\nSo all four of these ideas\nthat I've presented you\n\n00:16:50.198 --> 00:16:53.518\nare ways in which we can expand\nAmira's choice set.\n\n00:16:53.878 --> 00:16:57.134\nThey're ways in which we can have\ngreater choice for refugees\n\n00:16:57.158 --> 00:17:00.974\nbeyond those basic,\nimpossible three options\n\n00:17:00.998 --> 00:17:02.214\nI explained to you\n\n00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:04.318\nand still leave others better off.\n\n00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:08.294\nIn conclusion,\nwe really need a new vision,\n\n00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:11.094\na vision that enlarges\nthe choices of refugees\n\n00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:13.654\nbut recognizes that they\ndon't have to be a burden.\n\n00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:17.133\nThere's nothing inevitable\nabout refugees being a cost.\n\n00:17:17.158 --> 00:17:20.413\nYes, they are a humanitarian\nresponsibility,\n\n00:17:20.438 --> 00:17:24.054\nbut they're human beings\nwith skills, talents, aspirations,\n\n00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:26.758\nwith the ability to make\ncontributions -- if we let them.\n\n00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:29.718\nIn the new world,\n\n00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:32.534\nmigration is not going to go away.\n\n00:17:32.557 --> 00:17:35.534\nWhat we've seen in Europe\nwill be with us for many years.\n\n00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:37.373\nPeople will continue to travel,\n\n00:17:37.398 --> 00:17:39.254\nthey'll continue to be displaced,\n\n00:17:39.277 --> 00:17:42.774\nand we need to find rational,\nrealistic ways of managing this --\n\n00:17:42.798 --> 00:17:45.814\nnot based on the old logics\nof humanitarian assistance,\n\n00:17:45.838 --> 00:17:47.934\nnot based on logics of charity,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.574\nbut building on the opportunities\n\n00:17:49.598 --> 00:17:52.974\noffered by globalization,\nmarkets and mobility.\n\n00:17:52.998 --> 00:17:56.414\nI'd urge you all to wake up\nand urge our politicians\n\n00:17:56.438 --> 00:17:58.294\nto wake up to this challenge.\n\n00:17:58.318 --> 00:17:59.574\nThank you very much.\n\n00:17:59.598 --> 00:18:08.482\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Uber's plan to get more people into fewer cars", "duration": "1158", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/travis_kalanick_uber_s_plan_to_get_more_people_into_fewer_cars", "transcript": "Today I wanted to \u2014 well, this morning \u2014 I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation; about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets. And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ... not self-driving cars.But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years. Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber. And if it had survived, the future of transportation would probably already be here.So let me introduce you to the jitney. In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper. He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea. Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles, my hometown, and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go. He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney \u2014 that was slang for a nickel.And so people jumped on board, and not just in Los Angeles but across the country. And within one year, by 1915, there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle, 45,000 rides per day in Kansas and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles. To give you some perspective, Uber in Los Angeles is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ... 100 years later.And so these are the trolley guys, the existing transportation monopoly at the time. They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut. And so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.And there were all kinds of regulations. There were licenses \u2014 often they were pricey. In some cities, if you were a jitney driver, you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day. In other cities, they required two jitney drivers for one jitney. But there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light \u2014 install it in every Jitney \u2014 to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.(Laughter)All right. So what happened? Well, within a year this thing had taken off. But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.That's unfortunate ... because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one. And car ownership skyrocketed and it's no wonder that by 2007, there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States. And that phenomenon had gone global. In China by 2011, there were more car sales happening in China than in the US.Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost. In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year, wasted, sitting in traffic. 160 billion dollars in lost productivity, of course also sitting in traffic, and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.Now, that's only four percent of our problem though. Because if you have to own a car then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle. And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel. We even have skyscrapers built for cars. That's the world we live in today.Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades. It's called mass transit. And even in a city like New York City, one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world, there are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day. Why is that? Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep. And so back in San Francisco, where I live, the situation's much worse, in fact, much worse around the world.And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was \u2014 well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride. We didn't have any grand ambitions. But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride, and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides. We saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place.And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one. Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper \u2014 up to 50 percent cheaper \u2014 and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.And so the big question for us was: would it work? Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it? And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.In San Francisco, before uberPOOL, we had \u2014 well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted. And the bright colors is where we have the most cars. And once we introduced uberPOOL, well, you see there's not as many bright colors. More people getting around the city in fewer cars, taking cars off the road. It looks like uberPOOL is working.And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago. And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air. But the part that I'm really \u2014(Applause)But my favorite statistic \u2014 remember, I'm from LA, I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel, going, \"How do we fix this?\" \u2014 my favorite part is that eight months later, we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.Now, in China everything is supersized, and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month, that's 500,000 per day. And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen. In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too. And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about, \"Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done.\" How do we get that to a million? And in China, well, that could be several million.And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling. But what about the suburbs?This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California, and, well \u2014 look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever. And every morning at about the same time, cars roll of out their driveway, most of them, one person in the car, and they go to work, they go to their place of work. So the question for us is: well, how do we turn all of these commuter cars \u2014 and literally there's tens of millions of them \u2014 how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE. You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee, go to your car and you light up the Uber app, and all of a sudden, you become an Uber driver. And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it's a really great thing.There's just one hitch ... it's called regulation. So 54 cents a mile, what is that? Well, that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile. You can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice, for 54 cents a mile or less. But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal. But what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles? And what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States? If we could, it's obviously something we should do.And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney. If by 1915 this thing was taking off, imagine without the regulations that happened, if that thing could just keep going. How would our cities be different today? Would we have parks in the place of parking lots? Well, we lost that chance. But technology has given us another opportunity.Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality? With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation, we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.Travis Kalanick: Thank you.CA: You know \u2014 I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding. You only just talked about a small part of it here \u2014 a powerful part \u2014 the idea of turning cars into public transport like that, it's cool. But I've got a couple other questions because I know they're out there on people's minds.So first of all, last week I think it was, I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber and I couldn't find the app. You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.TK: Sure.CA: How did it go? Did you notice other people not finding the app that day? Are you going to win people over for this redesign?TK: Well, first I should probably just say, well, what we were trying to accomplish. And I think if you know a little bit about our history, it makes a lot more sense. Which is, when we first got started, it was just black cars. It was literally you push a button and get an S-Class. And so what we did was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car.And as we've gone worldwide and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India, it became something that was important for us to be more accessible, to be more hyperlocal, to be about the cities we were in and that's what you see with the patterns and colors. And to be more iconic, because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit, and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin. And so that was a little bit what it was about.Now, when you first roll out something like that, I mean, your hands are sweating, you've got \u2014 you know, you're a little worried. What we saw is a lot of people \u2014 actually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it. And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.CA: OK, that's cool.Now, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say. Your supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way, believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth, is to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor, which you've certainly proved to be.Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far, and you know \u2014 like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset. How did it feel like inside the company during that period? Did you notice a loss of business? Did you learn anything from that?TK: Well, look, I think \u2014 I've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school and you have \u2014 In various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us, it was about a year and a half ago, and for us it was hard times, too.Now, inside, we felt like \u2014 I guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work, but on the outside that wasn't evident. And so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of \u2014 We'd gone from a very small company \u2014 I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago, our company was 400 people, and today it's 6,500. And so when you go through that growth, you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time. And make sure that people are constantly checking to say, \"Are we good people doing good work?\" And if you check those boxes, the next part of that is making sure you're telling your story. And I think we learned a lot of lessons but I think at the end of it we came out stronger. But it was certainly a difficult period.CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn, you're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time. Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely \u2014 they claim \u2014 barely afford the deal anymore.How \u2014 You know, you said that you started this originally \u2014 just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride. This thing's taken off, you're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point. You're being forced to be, whether you want it or not, a kind of global visionary who's changing the world. I mean \u2014 who are you? Do you want that? Are you ready to go with that and be what that takes?TK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so \u2014(Laughter)First is on the pricing side \u2014 I mean, keep in mind, right? UberX, when we first started, was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product. It's now in many cities, half the price of a taxi. And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.What happens is when the price goes down, people are more likely to take Uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have, and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before. And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off, they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in. And so what that means is more trips per hour, more minutes of the hour where they're productive and actually, earnings come up.And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time. So even in New York \u2014 We have a blog post we call \"4 Septembers\" \u2014 compare the earnings September after September after September. Same month every year. And we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down. And there's a perfect price point \u2014 you can't go down forever. And in those places where we bring the price down but we don't see those earnings pop, we bring the prices back up.So that addresses that first part. And then the enigma and all of this \u2014 I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems. And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor. You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve, that's a really sad math professor. And so at Uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them. But we don't want just any math problem, we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find, and we want the one that if you solve it, there's a little bit of a wow factor.CA: In a couple years' time \u2014 say five years' time, I don't know when \u2014 you roll out your incredible self-driving cars, at probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride. What do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?TK: Explain that again \u2014 at which time?CA: At the time when self-driving cars are coming \u2014TK: Sure, sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that.CA: What do you say to a driver? TK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take \u2014 it's likely going to take a lot longer than I think some of the hype or media might expect. That's part one.Part two is it's going to also take \u2014 there's going to be a long transition. These cars will work in certain places and not in others.For us it's an interesting challenge, right? Because, well \u2014 Google's been investing in this since 2007, Tesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it, the manufacturers are going to be doing it. This is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason. A million people die a year in cars. And we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious. And think about the quality of life that improves when you give people their time back and it's not so anxiety-ridden. So I think there's a lot of good.And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge, but one for optimistic leadership, Where instead of resisting \u2014 resisting technology, maybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry \u2014 we have to embrace it or be a part of the future.But how do we optimistically lead through it? Are there ways to partner with cities? Are there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc., for that transition period. It will take a lot longer than I think we all expect, especially that transition period. But it is a world that's going to exist, and it is going to be a better world.CA: Travis, what you're building is absolutely incredible and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED and sharing so openly.Thank you so much.

existence.\n\n00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:12.038\nThat's unfortunate ...\n\n00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:17.654\nbecause, well, when you can't share a car,\nthen you have to own one.\n\n00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:19.694\nAnd car ownership skyrocketed\n\n00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:23.254\nand it's no wonder that by 2007,\n\n00:03:23.278 --> 00:03:26.838\nthere was a car for every man,\nwoman and child in the United States.\n\n00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:29.598\nAnd that phenomenon had gone global.\n\n00:03:30.238 --> 00:03:32.718\nIn China by 2011,\n\n00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:36.878\nthere were more car sales\nhappening in China than in the US.\n\n00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:41.214\nNow, all this private ownership\nof course had a public cost.\n\n00:03:41.238 --> 00:03:46.094\nIn the US, we spend\n7 billion hours a year,\n\n00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:48.078\nwasted, sitting in traffic.\n\n00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:51.678\n160 billion dollars in lost productivity,\n\n00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.934\nof course also sitting in traffic,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.894\nand one-fifth of all\nof our carbon footprint\n\n00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:01.078\nis spewed out in the air\nby those cars that we're sitting in.\n\n00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:05.174\nNow, that's only four percent\nof our problem though.\n\n00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:07.414\nBecause if you have to own a car\n\n00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.878\nthen that means 96 percent of the time\nyour car is sitting idle.\n\n00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:15.534\nAnd so, up to 30 percent\nof our land and our space\n\n00:04:15.558 --> 00:04:18.854\nis used storing these hunks of steel.\n\n00:04:18.878 --> 00:04:23.814\nWe even have skyscrapers built for cars.\n\n00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:25.758\nThat's the world we live in today.\n\n00:04:27.678 --> 00:04:30.758\nNow, cities have been dealing\nwith this problem for decades.\n\n00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:33.013\nIt's called mass transit.\n\n00:04:33.037 --> 00:04:35.574\nAnd even in a city like New York City,\n\n00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:37.814\none of the most densely\npopulated in the world\n\n00:04:37.838 --> 00:04:41.494\nand one of the most sophisticated\nmass transit systems in the world,\n\n00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:47.878\nthere are still 2.5 million cars\nthat go over those bridges every day.\n\n00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:49.638\nWhy is that?\n\n00:04:50.398 --> 00:04:54.438\nWell, it's because mass transit\nhasn't yet figured out\n\n00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.918\nhow to get to everybody's doorstep.\n\n00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:01.454\nAnd so back in San Francisco,\nwhere I live,\n\n00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:02.814\nthe situation's much worse,\n\n00:05:02.838 --> 00:05:05.438\nin fact, much worse around the world.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.414\nAnd so the beginning\nof Uber in 2010 was --\n\n00:05:09.438 --> 00:05:11.934\nwell, we just wanted\nto push a button and get a ride.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.254\nWe didn't have any grand ambitions.\n\n00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:15.614\nBut it just turned out\n\n00:05:15.638 --> 00:05:18.534\nthat lots of people wanted\nto push a button and get a ride,\n\n00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:23.118\nand ultimately what we started to see\nwas a lot of duplicate rides.\n\n00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:26.094\nWe saw a lot of people\n\n00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:29.134\npushing the same button at the same time\n\n00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:31.614\ngoing essentially to the same place.\n\n00:05:31.638 --> 00:05:33.214\nAnd so we started thinking about,\n\n00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:36.918\nwell, how do we make those two trips\nand turn them into one.\n\n00:05:37.798 --> 00:05:41.134\nBecause if we did,\nthat ride would be a lot cheaper --\n\n00:05:41.158 --> 00:05:42.638\nup to 50 percent cheaper --\n\n00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:44.374\nand of course for the city\n\n00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:47.454\nyou've got a lot more people\nand a lot fewer cars.\n\n00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:49.854\nAnd so the big question for us was:\n\n00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:51.174\nwould it work?\n\n00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:54.574\nCould you have a cheaper ride\n\n00:05:54.598 --> 00:05:57.438\ncheap enough that people\nwould be willing to share it?\n\n00:05:58.318 --> 00:06:01.558\nAnd the answer, fortunately,\nis a resounding yes.\n\n00:06:02.038 --> 00:06:03.734\nIn San Francisco,\n\n00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:06.414\nbefore uberPOOL, we had --\n\n00:06:06.438 --> 00:06:09.814\nwell, everybody would take their car\nwherever the heck they wanted.\n\n00:06:09.838 --> 00:06:12.358\nAnd the bright colors\nis where we have the most cars.\n\n00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:14.974\nAnd once we introduced uberPOOL,\n\n00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:17.278\nwell, you see there's not\nas many bright colors.\n\n00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:22.294\nMore people getting around\nthe city in fewer cars,\n\n00:06:22.318 --> 00:06:24.374\ntaking cars off the road.\n\n00:06:24.398 --> 00:06:26.318\nIt looks like uberPOOL is working.\n\n00:06:27.198 --> 00:06:29.638\nAnd so we rolled it out in Los Angeles\n\n00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.998\neight months ago.\n\n00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:37.558\nAnd since then, we've taken\n7.9 million miles off the roads\n\n00:06:38.078 --> 00:06:44.438\nand we've taken 1.4 thousand\nmetric tons of CO2 out of the air.\n\n00:06:45.358 --> 00:06:47.174\nBut the part that I'm really --\n\n00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.798\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.934\nBut my favorite statistic --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.214\nremember, I'm from LA,\n\n00:06:55.238 --> 00:06:56.494\nI spent years of my life\n\n00:06:56.518 --> 00:06:59.854\nsitting behind the wheel,\ngoing, \"How do we fix this?\" --\n\n00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:03.614\nmy favorite part\nis that eight months later,\n\n00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:09.678\nwe have added 100,000 new people\nthat are carpooling every week.\n\n00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:12.998\nNow, in China everything is supersized,\n\n00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:18.054\nand so we're doing 15 million\nuberPOOL trips per month,\n\n00:07:18.078 --> 00:07:20.134\nthat's 500,000 per day.\n\n00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:23.134\nAnd of course we're seeing\nthat exponential growth happen.\n\n00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:25.254\nIn fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.\n\n00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.654\nAnd when I talk to my team,\nwe don't talk about,\n\n00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:34.038\n\"Hey, well, 100,000 people\ncarpooling every week and we're done.\"\n\n00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:36.038\nHow do we get that to a million?\n\n00:07:36.638 --> 00:07:38.998\nAnd in China, well,\nthat could be several million.\n\n00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:45.894\nAnd so uberPOOL is a very great\nsolution for urban carpooling.\n\n00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:47.854\nBut what about the suburbs?\n\n00:07:47.878 --> 00:07:50.254\nThis is the street\nwhere I grew up in Los Angeles,\n\n00:07:50.278 --> 00:07:52.794\nit's actually a suburb\ncalled Northridge, California,\n\n00:07:52.808 --> 00:07:54.094\nand, well --\n\n00:07:54.118 --> 00:07:57.718\nlook, those mailboxes,\nthey kind of just go on forever.\n\n00:07:58.558 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd every morning at about the same time,\n\n00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:03.694\ncars roll of out their driveway,\n\n00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:06.478\nmost of them, one person in the car,\n\n00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:11.534\nand they go to work,\nthey go to their place of work.\n\n00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:12.814\nSo the question for us is:\n\n00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:14.078\nwell, how do we turn\n\n00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:17.094\nall of these commuter cars --\n\n00:08:17.118 --> 00:08:20.398\nand literally there's\ntens of millions of them --\n\n00:08:21.038 --> 00:08:24.118\nhow do we turn all these\ncommuter cars into shared cars?\n\n00:08:24.998 --> 00:08:29.238\nWell, we have something for this that we\nrecently launched called uberCOMMUTE.\n\n00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:32.551\nYou get up in the morning,\nget ready for work, get your coffee,\n\n00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:33.854\ngo to your car\n\n00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:35.894\nand you light up the Uber app,\n\n00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:37.414\nand all of a sudden,\n\n00:08:37.438 --> 00:08:39.158\nyou become an Uber driver.\n\n00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:42.694\nAnd we'll match you up\nwith one of your neighbors\n\n00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:43.918\non your way to work\n\n00:08:44.637 --> 00:08:46.318\nand it's a really great thing.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.238\nThere's just one hitch ...\n\n00:08:50.038 --> 00:08:51.958\nit's called regulation.\n\n00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.613\nSo 54 cents a mile, what is that?\n\n00:08:54.637 --> 00:08:56.694\nWell, that is what the US government\n\n00:08:56.718 --> 00:09:00.878\nhas determined that the cost\nof owning a car is per mile.\n\n00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:04.654\nYou can pick up anybody\nin the United States\n\n00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:08.254\nand take them wherever they want to go\nat a moment's notice,\n\n00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:10.774\nfor 54 cents a mile or less.\n\n00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:14.118\nBut if you charge 60 cents a mile,\nyou're a criminal.\n\n00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:17.014\nBut what if for 60 cents a mile\n\n00:09:17.038 --> 00:09:21.614\nwe could get half a million more people\ncarpooling in Los Angeles?\n\n00:09:21.638 --> 00:09:24.174\nAnd what if at 60 cents a mile\n\n00:09:24.198 --> 00:09:28.358\nwe could get 50 million people\ncarpooling in the United States?\n\n00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:30.174\nIf we could,\n\n00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:32.118\nit's obviously something we should do.\n\n00:09:33.078 --> 00:09:35.558\nAnd so it goes back\nto the lesson of the jitney.\n\n00:09:36.278 --> 00:09:40.014\nIf by 1915 this thing was taking off,\n\n00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:43.534\nimagine without\nthe regulations that happened,\n\n00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:45.278\nif that thing could just keep going.\n\n00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:48.974\nHow would our cities be different today?\n\n00:09:48.998 --> 00:09:52.694\nWould we have parks\nin the place of parking lots?\n\n00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:54.614\nWell, we lost that chance.\n\n00:09:54.638 --> 00:09:57.694\nBut technology has given us\nanother opportunity.\n\n00:09:57.718 --> 00:10:01.918\nNow, I'm as excited as anybody else\nabout self-driving cars\n\n00:10:02.918 --> 00:10:07.334\nbut do we have to really wait\nfive, 10 or even 20 years\n\n00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:10.678\nto make our new cities a reality?\n\n00:10:11.358 --> 00:10:14.334\nWith the technology in our pockets today,\n\n00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:16.158\nand a little smart regulation,\n\n00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:20.358\nwe can turn every car into a shared car,\n\n00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:24.998\nand we can reclaim our cities\nstarting today.\n\n00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:26.734\nThank you.\n\n00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:29.838\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:35.874 --> 00:10:37.494\nChris Anderson: Travis, thank you.\n\n00:10:37.518 --> 00:10:38.804\nTravis Kalanick: Thank you.\n\n00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:43.374\nCA: You know -- I mean the company\nyou've built is absolutely astounding.\n\n00:10:43.398 --> 00:10:46.254\nYou only just talked\nabout a small part of it here --\n\n00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:47.494\na powerful part --\n\n00:10:47.518 --> 00:10:50.214\nthe idea of turning cars\ninto public transport like that,\n\n00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:51.454\nit's cool.\n\n00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:53.294\nBut I've got a couple other questions\n\n00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:55.734\nbecause I know they're\nout there on people's minds.\n\n00:10:55.758 --> 00:10:58.094\nSo first of all, last week I think it was,\n\n00:10:58.118 --> 00:11:00.934\nI switched on my phone\nand tried to book an Uber\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.014\nand I couldn't find the app.\n\n00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:07.454\nYou had this very radical,\nvery bold, brave redesign.\n\n00:11:07.478 --> 00:11:08.894\nTK: Sure.\n\n00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.134\nCA: How did it go?\n\n00:11:10.158 --> 00:11:12.854\nDid you notice other people\nnot finding the app that day?\n\n00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:15.574\nAre you going to win people over\nfor this redesign?\n\n00:11:15.598 --> 00:11:17.654\nTK: Well, first I should\nprobably just say,\n\n00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:19.854\nwell, what we were trying to accomplish.\n\n00:11:19.878 --> 00:11:22.774\nAnd I think if you know\na little bit about our history,\n\n00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:24.734\nit makes a lot more sense.\n\n00:11:24.758 --> 00:11:26.974\nWhich is, when we first got started,\n\n00:11:26.998 --> 00:11:28.374\nit was just black cars.\n\n00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:31.054\nIt was literally you push a button\nand get an S-Class.\n\n00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:32.694\nAnd so what we did\n\n00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:38.054\nwas almost what I would call\nan immature version of a luxury brand\n\n00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:40.934\nthat looked like a badge on a luxury car.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.774\nAnd as we've gone worldwide\n\n00:11:42.798 --> 00:11:47.134\nand gone from S-Classes\nto auto rickshaws in India,\n\n00:11:47.158 --> 00:11:49.294\nit became something\nthat was important for us\n\n00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:51.694\nto be more accessible,\n\n00:11:51.718 --> 00:11:53.254\nto be more hyperlocal,\n\n00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:55.614\nto be about the cities we were in\n\n00:11:55.638 --> 00:11:58.134\nand that's what you see\nwith the patterns and colors.\n\n00:11:58.158 --> 00:11:59.414\nAnd to be more iconic,\n\n00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:02.054\nbecause a U doesn't mean\nanything in Sanskrit,\n\n00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:04.534\nand a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.\n\n00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:06.774\nAnd so that was\na little bit what it was about.\n\n00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:09.694\nNow, when you first\nroll out something like that,\n\n00:12:09.718 --> 00:12:11.254\nI mean, your hands are sweating,\n\n00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:12.494\nyou've got --\n\n00:12:12.518 --> 00:12:14.174\nyou know, you're a little worried.\n\n00:12:14.198 --> 00:12:15.814\nWhat we saw is a lot of people --\n\n00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:19.134\nactually, at the beginning,\nwe saw a lot more people opening the app\n\n00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:22.301\nbecause they were curious\nwhat they would find when they opened it.\n\n00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:27.198\nAnd our numbers were slightly up\nfrom what we expected.\n\n00:12:28.398 --> 00:12:29.654\nCA: OK, that's cool.\n\n00:12:29.678 --> 00:12:34.494\nNow, so you, yourself,\nare something of an enigma, I would say.\n\n00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:39.294\nYour supporters and investors,\nwho have been with you the whole way,\n\n00:12:39.318 --> 00:12:40.694\nbelieve that the only chance\n\n00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:43.934\nof sort of taking on\nthe powerful, entrenched interests\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.054\nof taxi industry and so forth,\n\n00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:49.734\nis to have someone who is\na fierce, relentless competitor,\n\n00:12:49.758 --> 00:12:51.478\nwhich you've certainly proved to be.\n\n00:12:51.998 --> 00:12:55.334\nSome people feel you've almost\ntaken that culture too far,\n\n00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.334\nand you know --\nlike a year or two ago\n\n00:12:57.358 --> 00:13:01.174\nthere was a huge controversy\nwhere a lot of women got upset.\n\n00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:06.134\nHow did it feel like\ninside the company during that period?\n\n00:13:06.158 --> 00:13:08.334\nDid you notice a loss of business?\n\n00:13:08.358 --> 00:13:10.894\nDid you learn anything from that?\n\n00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:12.174\nTK: Well, look, I think --\n\n00:13:12.198 --> 00:13:14.814\nI've been an entrepreneur\nsince I've been in high school\n\n00:13:14.838 --> 00:13:17.654\nand you have --\n\n00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:21.174\nIn various different ways\nan entrepreneur will see hard times\n\n00:13:21.198 --> 00:13:22.454\nand for us,\n\n00:13:22.478 --> 00:13:24.534\nit was about a year and a half ago,\n\n00:13:24.558 --> 00:13:26.278\nand for us it was hard times, too.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.038\nNow, inside, we felt like --\n\n00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:31.494\nI guess at the end of the day\n\n00:13:31.518 --> 00:13:35.774\nwe felt like we were\ngood people doing good work,\n\n00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:37.798\nbut on the outside that wasn't evident.\n\n00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:41.094\nAnd so there was a lot that we had to do\n\n00:13:41.118 --> 00:13:42.974\nto sort of --\n\n00:13:42.998 --> 00:13:44.854\nWe'd gone from a very small company --\n\n00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:47.974\nI mean if you go literally\ntwo and a half years ago,\n\n00:13:47.998 --> 00:13:50.134\nour company was 400 people,\n\n00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:52.238\nand today it's 6,500.\n\n00:13:52.838 --> 00:13:54.734\nAnd so when you go through that growth,\n\n00:13:54.758 --> 00:13:57.774\nyou have to sort of cement\nyour cultural values\n\n00:13:57.798 --> 00:13:59.598\nand talk about them all of the time.\n\n00:14:00.158 --> 00:14:03.334\nAnd make sure that people\nare constantly checking\n\n00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:05.854\nto say, \"Are we good people\ndoing good work?\"\n\n00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.534\nAnd if you check

world.\n\n00:14:54.118 --> 00:14:55.774\nI mean -- who are you?\n\n00:14:55.798 --> 00:14:57.014\nDo you want that?\n\n00:14:57.038 --> 00:15:00.814\nAre you ready to go with that\nand be what that takes?\n\n00:15:00.838 --> 00:15:04.174\nTK: Well, there's a few things\npacked in that question, so --\n\n00:15:04.198 --> 00:15:05.974\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:05.998 --> 00:15:09.494\nFirst is on the pricing side --\n\n00:15:09.518 --> 00:15:11.134\nI mean, keep in mind, right?\n\n00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:13.054\nUberX, when we first started,\n\n00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:16.878\nwas literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper\nthan our black car product.\n\n00:15:17.358 --> 00:15:18.598\nIt's now\n\n00:15:19.478 --> 00:15:22.558\nin many cities, half the price of a taxi.\n\n00:15:23.278 --> 00:15:25.414\nAnd we have all the data to show\n\n00:15:25.438 --> 00:15:29.614\nthat the divers are making more per hour\nthan they would as taxi drivers.\n\n00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:32.654\nWhat happens is when the price goes down,\n\n00:15:32.678 --> 00:15:35.214\npeople are more likely to take Uber\n\n00:15:35.238 --> 00:15:38.096\nat different times of the day\nthan they otherwise would have,\n\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.414\nand they're more likely to use it\nin places they wouldn't have before.\n\n00:15:41.438 --> 00:15:45.574\nAnd what that means for a driver\nis wherever he or she drops somebody off,\n\n00:15:45.598 --> 00:15:48.854\nthey're much more likely\nto get a pickup and get back in.\n\n00:15:48.878 --> 00:15:51.414\nAnd so what that means\nis more trips per hour,\n\n00:15:51.438 --> 00:15:53.854\nmore minutes of the hour\nwhere they're productive\n\n00:15:53.878 --> 00:15:55.774\nand actually, earnings come up.\n\n00:15:55.798 --> 00:15:59.854\nAnd we have cities where we've done\nliterally five or six price cuts\n\n00:15:59.878 --> 00:16:02.654\nand have seen those price cuts\ngo up over time.\n\n00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:04.214\nSo even in New York --\n\n00:16:04.238 --> 00:16:07.214\nWe have a blog post\nwe call \"4 Septembers\" --\n\n00:16:07.238 --> 00:16:08.454\ncompare the earnings\n\n00:16:08.478 --> 00:16:10.614\nSeptember after September after September.\n\n00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:11.878\nSame month every year.\n\n00:16:12.718 --> 00:16:15.454\nAnd we see the earnings going up over time\n\n00:16:15.478 --> 00:16:18.174\nas the price comes down.\n\n00:16:18.198 --> 00:16:21.494\nAnd there's a perfect price point --\nyou can't go down forever.\n\n00:16:21.518 --> 00:16:23.854\nAnd in those places\nwhere we bring the price down\n\n00:16:23.878 --> 00:16:25.614\nbut we don't see those earnings pop,\n\n00:16:25.638 --> 00:16:27.014\nwe bring the prices back up.\n\n00:16:27.038 --> 00:16:29.174\nSo that addresses that first part.\n\n00:16:29.198 --> 00:16:32.854\nAnd then the enigma and all of this --\n\n00:16:32.878 --> 00:16:35.494\nI mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am\n\n00:16:35.518 --> 00:16:39.078\nis one

I ran for Congress.For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however, told a very different story. My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win.But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating.Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect.And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they're going to be great in, that they know they're going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave.Some people worry about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society, we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look.In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls were quick to give up. The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely to redouble their efforts.What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious.(Applause)And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect.(Applause)So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code, and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection.We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story. During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over and she'll say, \"I don't know what code to write.\" The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust.It turns out that our girls are really good at coding, but it's not enough just to teach them to code.My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students. When the guys are struggling with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, \"Professor, there's something wrong with my code.\" The girls will come in and say, \"Professor, there's something wrong with me.\"We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone. Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me,\"I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance, two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run \u2014 yes, Tampon Run \u2014 to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyonc\u00e9, they will not defer their dreams.And those dreams have never been more important for our country. For the American economy, for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half our population. We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know \u2014 your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague \u2014 to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us.Thank you.(Applause) Thank you.Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls are involved now in your program?Reshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states.(Applause)And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly.CA: And you're working with some of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming graduates from your program?RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office.CA: And you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams, good things happen.RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies have diverse teams, and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things, and we see it every day.CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there. You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on. More power to you. Thank you.RS: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2448, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:14.653\nSo a few years ago,\n\n00:00:14.677 -->

endorsement\nfrom the New York Daily News,\n\n00:01:15.598 --> 00:01:18.934\nthe Wall Street Journal\nsnapped pictures of me on election day,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.558\nand CNBC called it one of the hottest\nraces in the country.\n\n00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:25.654\nI raised money from everyone I knew,\n\n00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:27.574\nincluding Indian aunties\n\n00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:30.318\nthat were just so happy\nan Indian girl was running.\n\n00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:34.374\nBut on election day, the polls were right,\n\n00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:37.438\nand I only got 19 percent of the vote,\n\n00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:41.614\nand the same papers\nthat said I was a rising political star\n\n00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:46.054\nnow said I wasted 1.3 million dollars\n\n00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:51.094\non 6,321 votes.\n\n00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:52.398\nDon't do the math.\n\n00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:55.438\nIt was humiliating.\n\n00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:58.934\nNow, before you get the wrong idea,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.398\nthis is not a talk\nabout the importance of failure.\n\n00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:03.638\nNor is it about leaning in.\n\n00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:07.574\nI tell you the story\nof how I ran for Congress\n\n00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:10.054\nbecause I was 33 years old\n\n00:02:10.078 --> 00:02:14.814\nand it was the first time\nin my entire life\n\n00:02:14.838 --> 00:02:18.494\nthat I had done something\nthat was truly brave,\n\n00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:21.198\nwhere I didn't worry about being perfect.\n\n00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:23.054\nAnd I'm not alone:\n\n00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:24.814\nso many women I talk to tell me\n\n00:02:24.838 --> 00:02:27.734\nthat they gravitate\ntowards careers and professions\n\n00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:29.854\nthat they know\nthey're going to be great in,\n\n00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:32.254\nthat they know they're\ngoing to be perfect in,\n\n00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:34.094\nand it's no wonder why.\n\n00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:37.174\nMost girls are taught\nto avoid risk and failure.\n\n00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.974\nWe're taught to smile pretty,\n\n00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:41.518\nplay it safe, get all A's.\n\n00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:43.974\nBoys, on the other hand,\n\n00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:46.774\nare taught to play rough, swing high,\n\n00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:51.558\ncrawl to the top of the monkey bars\nand then just jump off headfirst.\n\n00:02:52.158 --> 00:02:53.734\nAnd by the time they're adults,\n\n00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:58.534\nwhether they're negotiating a raise\nor even asking someone out on a date,\n\n00:02:58.558 --> 00:03:02.454\nthey're habituated\nto take risk after risk.\n\n00:03:02.478 --> 00:03:03.718\nThey're rewarded for it.\n\n00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:06.814\nIt's often said in Silicon Valley,\n\n00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:11.118\nno one even takes you seriously\nunless you've had two failed start-ups.\n\n00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:13.374\nIn other words,\n\n00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:16.494\nwe're raising our girls to be perfect,\n\n00:03:16.518 --> 00:03:19.838\nand we're raising our boys to be brave.\n\n00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:24.718\nSome people worry\nabout our federal deficit,\n\n00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:29.558\nbut I, I worry about our bravery deficit.\n\n00:03:30.198 --> 00:03:33.654\nOur economy, our society,\nwe're just losing out\n\n00:03:33.678 --> 00:03:36.198\nbecause we're not raising\nour girls to be brave.\n\n00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:40.254\nThe bravery deficit is why\nwomen are underrepresented in STEM,\n\n00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:42.214\nin C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,\n\n00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:44.798\nand pretty much everywhere you look.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.134\nIn the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck\n\n00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:51.814\nlooked at how bright fifth graders\nhandled an assignment\n\n00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:53.438\nthat was too difficult for them.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:58.134\nShe found that bright girls\nwere quick to give up.\n\n00:03:58.158 --> 00:04:01.878\nThe higher the IQ,\nthe more likely they were to give up.\n\n00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:04.214\nBright boys, on the other hand,\n\n00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:06.934\nfound the difficult material\nto be a challenge.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.694\nThey found it energizing.\n\n00:04:08.718 --> 00:04:11.918\nThey were more likely\nto redouble their efforts.\n\n00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:13.878\nWhat's going on?\n\n00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:15.974\nWell, at the fifth grade level,\n\n00:04:15.998 --> 00:04:19.654\ngirls routinely outperform boys\nin every subject,\n\n00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:21.814\nincluding math and science,\n\n00:04:21.838 --> 00:04:24.678\nso it's not a question of ability.\n\n00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:29.638\nThe difference is in how boys\nand girls approach a challenge.\n\n00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.237\nAnd it doesn't just end in fifth grade.\n\n00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:35.934\nAn HP report found\nthat men will apply for a job\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.598\nif they meet only 60 percent\nof the qualifications,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.694\nbut women, women will apply\n\n00:04:42.718 --> 00:04:47.294\nonly if they meet 100 percent\nof the qualifications.\n\n00:04:47.318 --> 00:04:48.598\n100 percent.\n\n00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:53.014\nThis study is usually invoked\nas evidence that, well,\n\n00:04:53.038 --> 00:04:54.758\nwomen need a little more confidence.\n\n00:04:55.318 --> 00:04:56.814\nBut I think it's evidence\n\n00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.974\nthat women have been socialized\nto aspire to perfection,\n\n00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:01.534\nand they're overly cautious.\n\n00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:04.374\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:06.454\nAnd even when we're ambitious,\n\n00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:09.254\neven when we're leaning in,\n\n00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:11.494\nthat socialization of perfection\n\n00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:14.598\nhas caused us to take\nless risks in our careers.\n\n00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:19.854\nAnd so those 600,000 jobs\nthat are open right now\n\n00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:21.118\nin computing and tech,\n\n00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:23.654\nwomen are being left behind,\n\n00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:26.334\nand it means our economy\nis being left behind\n\n00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:30.534\non all the innovation and problems\nwomen would solve\n\n00:05:30.558 --> 00:05:33.294\nif they were socialized to be brave\n\n00:05:33.318 --> 00:05:36.398\ninstead of socialized to be perfect.\n\n00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:40.854\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:40.878 --> 00:05:45.214\nSo in 2012, I started a company\nto teach girls to code,\n\n00:05:45.238 --> 00:05:48.294\nand what I found\nis that by teaching them to code\n\n00:05:48.318 --> 00:05:50.478\nI had socialized them to be brave.\n\n00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:55.414\nCoding, it's an endless process\nof trial and error,\n\n00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.614\nof trying to get the right command\nin the right place,\n\n00:05:58.638 --> 00:06:01.054\nwith sometimes just a semicolon\n\n00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:04.398\nmaking the difference\nbetween success and failure.\n\n00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:07.294\nCode breaks and then it falls apart,\n\n00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:09.734\nand it often takes many, many tries\n\n00:06:09.758 --> 00:06:12.054\nuntil that magical moment\n\n00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:15.158\nwhen what you're trying\nto build comes to life.\n\n00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:18.198\nIt requires perseverance.\n\n00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:21.318\nIt requires imperfection.\n\n00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:24.494\nWe immediately see in our program\n\n00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:26.854\nour girls' fear of not getting it right,\n\n00:06:26.878 --> 00:06:28.118\nof not being perfect.\n\n00:06:28.798 --> 00:06:31.974\nEvery Girls Who Code teacher\ntells me the same story.\n\n00:06:31.998 --> 00:06:34.974\nDuring the first week,\nwhen the girls are learning how to code,\n\n00:06:34.998 --> 00:06:37.974\na student will call her over\nand she'll say,\n\n00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.014\n\"I don't know what code to write.\"\n\n00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:41.974\nThe teacher will look at her screen,\n\n00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:43.878\nand she'll see a blank text editor.\n\n00:06:44.598 --> 00:06:47.414\nIf she didn't know any better,\nshe'd think that her student\n\n00:06:47.438 --> 00:06:50.518\nspent the past 20 minutes\njust staring at the screen.\n\n00:06:51.358 --> 00:06:54.534\nBut if she presses undo a few times,\n\n00:06:54.558 --> 00:06:58.278\nshe'll see that her student\nwrote code and then deleted it.\n\n00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:02.054\nShe tried, she came close,\n\n00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:04.158\nbut she didn't get it exactly right.\n\n00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:07.614\nInstead of showing\nthe progress that she made,\n\n00:07:07.638 --> 00:07:09.598\nshe'd rather show nothing at all.\n\n00:07:10.118 --> 00:07:12.958\nPerfection or bust.\n\n00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:19.158\nIt turns out that our girls\nare really good at coding,\n\n00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:21.989\nbut it's not enough\njust to teach them to code.\n\n00:07:22.678 --> 00:07:25.869\nMy friend Lev Brie, who is a professor\nat the University of Columbia\n\n00:07:25.893 --> 00:07:27.654\nand teaches intro to Java\n\n00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:31.358\ntells me about his office hours\nwith computer science students.\n\n00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:34.334\nWhen the guys are struggling\nwith an assignment,\n\n00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:35.934\nthey'll come in and they'll say,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.318\n\"Professor, there's something\nwrong with my code.\"\n\n00:07:38.838 --> 00:07:40.334\nThe girls will come in and say,\n\n00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:44.398\n\"Professor, there's something\nwrong with me.\"\n\n00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:48.774\nWe have to begin to undo\nthe socialization of perfection,\n\n00:07:48.798 --> 00:07:51.414\nbut we've got to combine it\nwith building a sisterhood\n\n00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:54.278\nthat lets girls know\nthat they are not alone.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.998\nBecause trying harder\nis not going to fix a broken system.\n\n00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:01.894\nI can't tell you how many women tell me,\n\n00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:03.694\n\"I'm afraid to raise my hand,\n\n00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:05.854\nI'm afraid to ask a question,\n\n00:08:05.878 --> 00:08:08.254\nbecause I don't want to be the only one\n\n00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:09.718\nwho doesn't understand,\n\n00:08:10.318 --> 00:08:12.998\nthe only one who is struggling.\n\n00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:16.694\nWhen we teach girls to be brave\n\n00:08:16.718 --> 00:08:20.014\nand we have a supportive network\ncheering them on,\n\n00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:23.054\nthey will build incredible things,\n\n00:08:23.078 --> 00:08:25.798\nand I see this every day.\n\n00:08:26.478 --> 00:08:29.094\nTake, for instance,\ntwo of our high school students\n\n00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:31.494\nwho built a game called Tampon Run --\n\n00:08:31.518 --> 00:08:33.974\nyes, Tampon Run --\n\n00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:36.414\nto fight against the menstruation taboo\n\n00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:38.638\nand sexism in gaming.\n\n00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:41.374\nOr the Syrian refugee\n\n00:08:41.398 --> 00:08:44.918\nwho dared show her love\nfor her new country\n\n00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:49.757\nby building an app\nto help Americans get to the polls.\n\n00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:54.973\nOr a 16-year-old girl\nwho built an algorithm\n\n00:08:54.997 --> 00:09:00.054\nto help detect whether a cancer\nis benign or malignant\n\n00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:03.454\nin the off chance\nthat she can save her daddy's life\n\n00:09:03.478 --> 00:09:06.038\nbecause he has cancer.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.358\nThese are just\nthree examples of thousands,\n\n00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:16.174\nthousands of girls who have been\nsocialized to be imperfect,\n\n00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:19.151\nwho have learned to keep trying,\nwho have learned perseverance.\n\n00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:21.174\nAnd whether they become coders\n\n00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:23.854\nor the next Hillary Clinton or Beyonc\u00e9,\n\n00:09:23.878 --> 00:09:27.198\nthey will not defer their dreams.\n\n00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:32.398\nAnd those dreams have never been\nmore important for our country.\n\n00:09:33.278 --> 00:09:36.414\nFor the American economy,\nfor any economy to grow,\n\n00:09:36.438 --> 00:09:38.574\nto truly innovate,\n\n00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:41.798\nwe cannot leave behind\nhalf our population.\n\n00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:46.294\nWe have to socialize our girls\nto be comfortable with imperfection,\n\n00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:49.238\nand we've got to do it now.\n\n00:09:50.358 --> 00:09:54.574\nWe cannot wait for them\nto learn how to be brave like I did\n\n00:09:54.598 --> 00:09:56.678\nwhen I was 33 years old.\n\n00:09:57.198 --> 00:09:59.534\nWe have to teach them\nto be brave in schools\n\n00:09:59.558 --> 00:10:01.294\nand early in their careers,\n\n00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:04.454\nwhen it has the most potential\nto impact their lives\n\n00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.494\nand the lives of others,\n\n00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:11.294\nand we have to show them\nthat they will be loved and accepted\n\n00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:14.374\nnot for being perfect\n\n00:10:14.398 --> 00:10:17.038\nbut for being courageous.\n\n00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:21.614\nAnd so I need each of you\nto tell every young woman you know --\n\n00:10:21.638 --> 00:10:25.054\nyour sister, your niece,\nyour employee, your colleague --\n\n00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:27.638\nto be comfortable with imperfection,\n\n00:10:28.318 --> 00:10:30.814\nbecause when we teach\ngirls to be imperfect,\n\n00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:33.414\nand we help them leverage it,\n\n00:10:33.438 --> 00:10:37.334\nwe will build a movement\nof young women who are brave\n\n00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:40.734\nand who will build\na better

Yeah.\nSo in 2012, we taught 20 girls.\n\n00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:14.894\nThis year we'll teach 40,000\nin all 50 states.\n\n00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:16.174\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:19.254\nAnd that number is really powerful,\n\n00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:24.574\nbecause last year we only graduated\n7,500 women in computer science.\n\n00:11:24.598 --> 00:11:27.174\nLike, the problem is so bad\n\n00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:29.678\nthat we can make\nthat type of change quickly.\n\n00:11:30.558 --> 00:11:33.774\nCA: And you're working with some\nof the companies in this room

It's in the news every day. But what is it?Some places in the world it's too little food, maybe too much. Other places, GMO is saving the world. Maybe GMO is the problem? Too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans, toxic oceans, attenuation of nutrition. They go on and on. And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering. So how do we bring that to something that we understand?How is this apple food crisis? You've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure. How old do you think it was from when it was picked? Two weeks? Two months? Eleven months \u2014 the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States. And I don't expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world. We pick them, we put them in cold storage, we gas the cold storage \u2014 there's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying, because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans.How is it that none of you knew this? Why didn't I know this? Ninety percent of the quality of that apple \u2014 all of the antioxidants \u2014 are gone by the time we get it. It's basically a little ball of sugar. How did we get so information poor and how can we do better?I think what's missing is a platform. I know platforms \u2014 I know computers, they put me on the Internet when I was young. I did very weird things \u2014(Laughter)on this platform. But I met people, and I could express myself.How do you express yourself in food? If we had a platform, we might feel empowered to question: What if? For me, I questioned: What if climate was democratic? So, this is a map of climate in the world. The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red. They shift and they change, and Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers. China picks up land in Brazil to grow better food, and we're a slave to climate. What if each country had its own productive climate? What would that change about how we live? What would that change about quality of life and nutrition?The last generation's problem was, we need more food and we need it cheap. Welcome to your global farm. We built a huge analog farm. All these traces \u2014 these are cars, planes, trains and automobiles. It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food.What if ... we built a digital farm? A digital world farm. What if you could take this apple, digitize it somehow, send it through particles in the air and reconstitute it on the other side? What if?Going through some of these quotes, you know, they inspire me to do what I do.First one:[\"Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future.\"]That's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku, one stop south of Fukushima, after the disaster. The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70 percent of their own food. But it's not unique to Japan. Two percent of the American population is involved in farming. What good answer comes from two percent of any population? As we go around the world, 50 percent of the African population is under 18. Eighty percent don't want to be farmers. Farming is hard. The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable. They go into the city. In India: farmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities, more farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that. It's uncomfortable to talk about. Where are they going? Into the city. No young people, and everyone's headed in. So how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?Welcome to the new tractor. This is my combine. A number of years ago now, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and I started hacking. And I built silly things and I made plants dance and I attached them to my computer and I killed them all \u2014 a lot.(Laughter)I eventually got them to survive. And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life, because I was learning the language of plants. I wanted to make it bigger. They said, \"Knock yourself out, kid! Here's an old electronics room that nobody wants. What can you do?\"With my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab, a place historically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life. Inside of these 60 square feet, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month \u2014 not a lot of food. And there's a lot of interesting technology in there. But the most interesting thing? Beautiful, white roots, deep, green colors and a monthly harvest. Is this a new cafeteria? Is this a new retail experience? Is this a new grocery store? I can tell you one thing for sure: this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything.(Laughter)We get our salad in bags; there's nothing wrong with that. But what happens when you have an image-based processing expert, a data scientist, a roboticist, ripping roots off and thinking, \"Huh. I know something about \u2014 I could make this happen, I want to try.\"In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab, because if you grew it, you don't throw it away; it's kind of precious to you. I have this weird tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first, because I want it to be good. So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the pH of a lettuce within .1.(Laughter)I'm like, \"No, that's 6.1 \u2014 no, no, you can't eat it today.\"(Applause)This lettuce that day was hyper sweet. It was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: \"I'm not going to die!\" And the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me. Technologists falling backwards into plant physiology.So we thought other people needed to be able to try this. We want to see what people can create, so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere. And then we built it.So on the facade of the media lab is my lab, that has about 30 points of sensing per plant. If you know about the genome or genetics, this is the phenome, right? The phenomena. When you say, \"I like the strawberries from Mexico,\" you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression that you like. So if you're coding climate \u2014 this much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe \u2014 you're coding the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, the size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture. We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what's going on.If you think of your houseplants, and you look at your houseplant and you're super sad, because you're like, \"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?\"(Laughter)Farmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes by the time they're in their late 60s and 70s. They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity. Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down.These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer. We trend those data points over time. We correlate those data points to individual plants. These are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address.(Laughter)We have IP-addressable broccoli.(Applause)So if that's not weird enough, you can click one and you get a plant profile. And what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant, but not like you'd think, it's not just when it's ready. When does it achieve the nutrition that I need? When does it achieve the taste that I desire? Is it getting too much water? Is it getting too much sun? Alerts. It can talk to me, it's conversant, we have a language.(Laughter)(Applause)I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right? That's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends.(Laughter)And I mean it \u2014 it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium. We're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now. And they may not friend us back \u2014 I don't know, they might friend us back, it depends on how we act.So this is my lab now. It's a little bit more systematized, my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.And so \u2014 inside of this environment, we're experimenting with all kinds of things. This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station for reducing the amount of water they send into space. What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen. Roots are not that complicated, so when you give them that, you get this amazing expression. It's like the plant has two hearts. And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster. It's a perfect world. We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is perfect world.So we've grown all kinds of things. These tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years. Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks? Banks of seed. It's amazing. They have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten. I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato. Problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook, so we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great. But we've done things with protein \u2014 we've grown all kinds of things. We've grown humans \u2014(Laughter)Well maybe you could, but we didn't.But what we realized is, the tool was too big, it was too expensive. I was starting to put them around the world and they were about 100,000 dollars. Finding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted to make a small one.This project was actually one of my student's \u2014 mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille. So Camille and I and my team, we iterated all summer, how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it so other people can make it. Then we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade. And if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something.So I went into this school and I said, \"Set it to 65 percent humidity.\"The seventh grader said, \"What's humidity?\"And I said, \"Oh, it's water in air.\"He said, \"There's no water in air, you're an idiot.\"(Laughter)And I was like, \"Alright, don't trust me. Actually \u2014 don't trust me, right? Set it to 100. He sets it to 100 and what happens? It starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip.And he says, \"Oh. Humidity is rain. Why didn't you just tell me that?\"(Laughter)We've created an interface for this that's much like a game. They have a 3D environment, they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone, on their tablet. They have different parts of the bots \u2014 the physical, the sensors. They select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world. They select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling. While it's growing, they make changes. They're like, \"Why does a plant need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad? It kills people.\" Crank up CO2, plant dies. Or crank down CO2, plant does very well. Harvest plant, and you've created a new digital recipe.It's an iterative design and development and exploration process. They can download, then, all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do \u2014 was it better or was it worse? Imagine these as little cores of processing. We're going to learn so much.Here's one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school in three weeks' time. This is three weeks of growth. But more importantly, it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer \u2014 or that he would want to be a farmer.So, we've open-sourced all of this. It's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer. It's going to be difficult \u2014 I'm just telling you. We're in the beginning, but it's all there. It's very important to me that this is easily accessible. We're going to keep making it more so.These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, plant scientist, economist, urban planners. On one platform, doing what they're good at. But we got a little too big.This is my new facility that I'm just starting. This warehouse could be anywhere. That's why I chose it. And inside of this warehouse we're going to build something kind of like this. These exist right now. Take a look at it. These exist, too. One grows greens, one grows Ebola vaccine. Pretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner is one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola. The plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant. So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, all they way down to lettuce.But these two things look nothing alike, and that's where I am with my field. Everything is different. We're in that weird \"We're alright\" stage and it's like, \"Here's my black box \u2014\" \"No, buy mine.\" \"No, no, no \u2014 I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable. Don't buy his, buy mine.\"And the reality is, we're just at the beginning, in a time when society is shifting, too. When we ask for more, cheaper food, we're now asking for better, environmentally friendly food. And when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget, the most mysterious food item of all time \u2014 they are now basing their marketing plan on that \u2014 everything is changing.So into the world now. Personal food computers, food servers and food data centers run on the open phenome. Think open genome, but we're going to put little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can pull down, actuate and grow.What does this look like in a world? You remember the world connected by strings? We start having beacons. We start sending information about food, rather than sending food. This is not just my fantasy, this is where we're already deploying. Food computers, food servers, soon-to-be food data centers, connecting people together to share information.The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this. We know what's wrong with this. The future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, \"What if?\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2432, "subtitle":

these traces --\n\n00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.134\nthese are cars, planes,\ntrains and automobiles.\n\n00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:53.740\nIt's a miracle that we feed\nseven billion people\n\n00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:56.809\nwith just a few of us involved\nin the production of food.\n\n00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:58.835\nWhat if ...\n\n00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:01.392\nwe built a digital farm?\n\n00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:02.579\nA digital world farm.\n\n00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:05.412\nWhat if you could take this apple,\n\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.720\ndigitize it somehow,\n\n00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:10.212\nsend it through particles in the air\n\n00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:12.646\nand reconstitute it on the other side?\n\n00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:14.455\nWhat if?\n\n00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:16.971\nGoing through some of these quotes,\n\n00:03:16.995 --> 00:03:19.037\nyou know, they inspire me to do what I do.\n\n00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.216\nFirst one:\n\n00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.350\n[\"Japanese farming has no youth,\nno water, no land and no future.\"]\n\n00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:28.463\nThat's what I landed to the day\nthat I went to Minamisanriku,\n\n00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:30.060\none stop south of Fukushima,\n\n00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.786\nafter the disaster.\n\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.361\nThe kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,\n\n00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:35.760\nthe land is contaminated,\n\n00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:38.105\nthey already import 70 percent\nof their own food.\n\n00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.269\nBut it's not unique to Japan.\n\n00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:44.104\nTwo percent of the American population\nis involved in farming.\n\n00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.591\nWhat good answer comes\nfrom two percent of any population?\n\n00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:51.268\nAs we go around the world,\n\n00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:54.903\n50 percent of the African\npopulation is under 18.\n\n00:03:55.863 --> 00:03:58.679\nEighty percent don't want to be farmers.\n\n00:03:58.703 --> 00:04:00.157\nFarming is hard.\n\n00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.440\nThe life of a small-shareholder\nfarmer is miserable.\n\n00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.631\nThey go into the city.\n\n00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:07.815\nIn India:\n\n00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.671\nfarmers' families not being able\nto have basic access to utilities,\n\n00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:15.494\nmore farmer suicides this year\nand the previous 10 before that.\n\n00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:17.153\nIt's uncomfortable to talk about.\n\n00:04:17.177 --> 00:04:18.345\nWhere are they going?\n\n00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:19.577\nInto the city.\n\n00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.845\nNo young people, and everyone's headed in.\n\n00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:26.840\nSo how do we build this platform\nthat inspires the youth?\n\n00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:29.277\nWelcome to the new tractor.\n\n00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:31.539\nThis is my combine.\n\n00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:33.481\nA number of years ago now,\n\n00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:35.667\nI went to Bed Bath and Beyond\nand Home Depot\n\n00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:36.842\nand I started hacking.\n\n00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:38.081\nAnd I built silly things\n\n00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:39.256\nand I made plants dance\n\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.131\nand I attached them to my computer\n\n00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:42.445\nand I killed them all --\n\n00:04:42.924 --> 00:04:44.097\na lot.\n\n00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:45.121\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:47.341\nI eventually got them to survive.\n\n00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:49.831\nAnd I created one of the most\nintimate relationships\n\n00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:51.070\nI've ever had in my life,\n\n00:04:51.094 --> 00:04:54.199\nbecause I was learning\nthe language of plants.\n\n00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.284\nI wanted to make it bigger.\n\n00:04:56.308 --> 00:04:58.071\nThey said, \"Knock yourself out, kid!\n\n00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.996\nHere's an old electronics room\nthat nobody wants.\n\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.322\nWhat can you do?\"\n\n00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:05.616\nWith my team, we built a farm\ninside of the media lab,\n\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.574\na place historically known\nnot for anything about biology\n\n00:05:09.598 --> 00:05:12.147\nbut everything about digital life.\n\n00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:14.813\nInside of these 60 square feet,\n\n00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:17.963\nwe produced enough food to feed\nabout 300 people once a month --\n\n00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:19.139\nnot a lot of food.\n\n00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:21.678\nAnd there's a lot of interesting\ntechnology in there.\n\n00:05:21.702 --> 00:05:23.357\nBut the most interesting thing?\n\n00:05:24.184 --> 00:05:25.889\nBeautiful, white roots,\n\n00:05:26.436 --> 00:05:28.857\ndeep, green colors\n\n00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.119\nand a monthly harvest.\n\n00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:34.187\nIs this a new cafeteria?\n\n00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:38.066\nIs this a new retail experience?\n\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.664\nIs this a new grocery store?\n\n00:05:39.688 --> 00:05:41.569\nI can tell you one thing for sure:\n\n00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:43.235\nthis is the first time\n\n00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.140\nanybody in the media lab\nripped the roots off of anything.\n\n00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:47.988\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:50.191\nWe get our salad in bags;\n\n00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:51.951\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n00:05:52.358 --> 00:05:53.879\nBut what happens\n\n00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:57.014\nwhen you have an image-based\nprocessing expert,\n\n00:05:57.038 --> 00:05:58.453\na data scientist,\n\n00:05:58.954 --> 00:06:00.350\na roboticist,\n\n00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:02.417\nripping roots off and thinking,\n\n00:06:02.441 --> 00:06:04.321\n\"Huh. I know something about --\n\n00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:06.538\nI could make this happen, I want to try.\"\n\n00:06:07.322 --> 00:06:09.597\nIn that process we would\nbring the plants out\n\n00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.530\nand we would take some back to the lab,\n\n00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:13.810\nbecause if you grew it,\nyou don't throw it away;\n\n00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:15.231\nit's kind of precious to you.\n\n00:06:15.255 --> 00:06:16.652\nI have this weird tongue now,\n\n00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:20.120\nbecause I'm afraid to let anybody eat\nanything until I've eaten it first,\n\n00:06:20.144 --> 00:06:21.533\nbecause I want it to be good.\n\n00:06:21.557 --> 00:06:22.803\nSo I eat lettuce every day\n\n00:06:22.827 --> 00:06:25.284\nand I can tell the pH\nof a lettuce within .1.\n\n00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:26.313\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:26.337 --> 00:06:29.508\nI'm like, \"No, that's 6.1 -- no,\nno, you can't eat it today.\"\n\n00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:32.677\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.588\nThis lettuce that day was hyper sweet.\n\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.868\nIt was hyper sweet\nbecause the plant had been stressed\n\n00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:43.021\nand it created a chemical reaction\nin the plant to protect itself:\n\n00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:44.209\n\"I'm not going to die!\"\n\n00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:47.362\nAnd the plants not-going-to-die,\ntaste sweet to me.\n\n00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.503\nTechnologists falling backwards\ninto plant physiology.\n\n00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:54.232\nSo we thought other people\nneeded to be able to try this.\n\n00:06:54.256 --> 00:06:56.113\nWe want to see what people can create,\n\n00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:58.826\nso we conceived of a lab\nthat could be shipped anywhere.\n\n00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:00.549\nAnd then we built it.\n\n00:07:02.053 --> 00:07:04.676\nSo on the facade\nof the media lab is my lab,\n\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.393\nthat has about 30 points\nof sensing per plant.\n\n00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:11.162\nIf you know about the genome or genetics,\n\n00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:13.689\nthis is the phenome, right?\n\n00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:14.955\nThe phenomena.\n\n00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.459\nWhen you say, \"I like\nthe strawberries from Mexico,\"\n\n00:07:17.483 --> 00:07:19.872\nyou really like the strawberries\nfrom the climate\n\n00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:21.984\nthat produced the expression\nthat you like.\n\n00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.197\nSo if you're coding climate --\n\n00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.522\nthis much CO2, this much O2 creates\na recipe -- you're coding\n\n00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:30.821\nthe expression of that plant,\nthe nutrition of that plant,\n\n00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:34.103\nthe size of that plant, the shape,\nthe color, the texture.\n\n00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:36.826\nWe need data,\n\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.631\nso we put a bunch of sensors in there\n\n00:07:38.655 --> 00:07:39.958\nto tell us what's going on.\n\n00:07:39.982 --> 00:07:41.564\nIf you think of your houseplants,\n\n00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:43.083\nand you look at your houseplant\n\n00:07:43.107 --> 00:07:45.119\nand you're super sad, because you're like,\n\n00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:47.159\n\"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?\"\n\n00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:48.183\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:48.617 --> 00:07:51.439\nFarmers develop the most beautiful\nfortune-telling eyes\n\n00:07:51.463 --> 00:07:53.634\nby the time they're in their\nlate 60s and 70s.\n\n00:07:53.658 --> 00:07:55.851\nThey can tell you when you\nsee that plant dying\n\n00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.414\nthat it's a nitrogen deficiency,\na calcium deficiency\n\n00:07:58.438 --> 00:07:59.842\nor it needs more humidity.\n\n00:07:59.866 --> 00:08:02.181\nThose beautiful eyes\nare not being passed down.\n\n00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:05.475\nThese are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.\n\n00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:08.253\nWe trend those data points over time.\n\n00:08:08.763 --> 00:08:11.238\nWe correlate those data points\nto individual plants.\n\n00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:15.312\nThese are all the broccoli\nin my lab that day, by IP address.\n\n00:08:15.336 --> 00:08:16.474\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:16.498 --> 00:08:19.219\nWe have IP-addressable broccoli.\n\n00:08:20.134 --> 00:08:24.648\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:27.347\nSo if that's not weird enough,\n\n00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.860\nyou can click one\nand you get a plant profile.\n\n00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.900\nAnd what this tells you\nis downloadable progress on that plant,\n\n00:08:32.924 --> 00:08:34.130\nbut not like you'd think,\n\n00:08:34.154 --> 00:08:35.599\nit's not just when it's ready.\n\n00:08:35.623 --> 00:08:37.899\nWhen does it achieve\nthe nutrition that I need?\n\n00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:40.703\nWhen does it achieve\nthe taste that I desire?\n\n00:08:41.242 --> 00:08:42.918\nIs it getting too much water?\n\n00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:44.854\nIs it getting too much sun?\n\n00:08:44.878 --> 00:08:46.042\nAlerts.\n\n00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:47.900\nIt can talk to me, it's conversant,\n\n00:08:47.924 --> 00:08:49.288\nwe have a language.\n\n00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:51.789\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:51.813 --> 00:08:56.449\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:56.473 --> 00:09:01.252\nI think of that as the first user\non the plant Facebook, right?\n\n00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:02.482\nThat's a plant profile\n\n00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:04.499\nand that plant will start making friends.\n\n00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:05.530\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:05.554 --> 00:09:08.173\nAnd I mean it -- it will make\nfriends with other plants\n\n00:09:08.197 --> 00:09:10.324\nthat use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,\n\n00:09:10.348 --> 00:09:11.546\nless potassium.\n\n00:09:11.868 --> 00:09:13.849\nWe're going to learn about a complexity\n\n00:09:13.873 --> 00:09:15.490\nthat we can only guess at now.\n\n00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:19.586\nAnd they may not friend us back --\nI don't know, they might friend us back,\n\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.809\nit depends on how we act.\n\n00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:22.791\nSo this is my lab now.\n\n00:09:23.252 --> 00:09:24.990\nIt's a little bit more systematized,\n\n00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:28.245\nmy background is designing data centers\nin hospitals of all things,\n\n00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:31.237\nso I know a little bit about creating\na controlled environment.\n\n00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.411\nAnd so --\n\n00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:34.355\ninside of this environment,\n\n00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:36.752\nwe're experimenting\nwith all kinds of things.\n\n00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:40.984\nThis process, aeroponics, was developed\nby NASA for Mir Space Station\n\n00:09:41.008 --> 00:09:43.556\nfor reducing the amount of water\nthey send into space.\n\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.439\nWhat it really does is give the plant\nexactly what it wants:\n\n00:09:46.463 --> 00:09:48.098\nwater, minerals and oxygen.\n\n00:09:48.122 --> 00:09:49.614\nRoots are not that complicated,\n\n00:09:49.638 --> 00:09:53.550\nso when you give them that,\nyou get this amazing expression.\n\n00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.503\nIt's like the plant has two hearts.\n\n00:09:57.527 --> 00:09:59.192\nAnd because it has two hearts,\n\n00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:01.985\nit grows four or five times faster.\n\n00:10:02.615 --> 00:10:03.769\nIt's a perfect world.\n\n00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:07.006\nWe've gone a long way into technology\nand seed for an adverse world\n\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.895\nand we're going to continue to do that,\n\n00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:10.832\nbut we're going to have a new tool, too,\n\n00:10:10.856 --> 00:10:12.539\nwhich is perfect world.\n\n00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:14.242\nSo we've grown all kinds of things.\n\n00:10:14.266 --> 00:10:18.074\nThese tomatoes hadn't been\nin commercial production for 150 years.\n\n00:10:18.473 --> 00:10:21.747\nDo you know that we have\nrare and ancient seed banks?\n\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.012\nBanks of seed.\n\n00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:25.193\nIt's amazing.\n\n00:10:25.217 --> 00:10:28.099\nThey have germplasm alive\nand things that you've never eaten.\n\n00:10:28.123 --> 00:10:31.404\nI am the only person in this room\nthat's eaten that kind of tomato.\n\n00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:34.796\nProblem is it was a sauce tomato\nand we don't know how to cook,\n\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.176\nso we ate a sauce tomato,\nwhich is not that great.\n\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.516\nBut we've done things with protein --\nwe've grown all kinds of things.\n\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.713\nWe've grown humans --\n\n00:10:41.737 --> 00:10:43.379\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:45.793\nWell maybe you could, but we didn't.\n\n00:10:45.817 --> 00:10:47.413\nBut what we realized is,\n\n00:10:47.437 --> 00:10:49.512\nthe tool was too big,\nit was too expensive.\n\n00:10:49.536 --> 00:10:51.540\nI was starting to put them\naround the world\n\n00:10:51.564 --> 00:10:53.381\nand they were about 100,000 dollars.\n\n00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:56.414\nFinding somebody with 100 grand\nin their back pocket isn't easy,\n\n00:10:56.438 --> 00:10:58.018\nso we wanted to make a small one.\n\n00:10:58.042 --> 00:11:00.339\nThis project was actually\none of my student's --\n\n00:11:00.363 --> 00:11:03.219\nmechanical engineering\nundergraduate, Camille.\n\n00:11:03.809 --> 00:11:05.341\nSo Camille and I and my team,\n\n00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.223\nwe iterated all summer,\n\n00:11:07.247 --> 00:11:09.667\nhow to make it cheaper,\nhow to make it work better,\n\n00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:11.715\nhow to make it so other\npeople can make it.\n\n00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:15.042\nThen we dropped them off in schools,\nseventh through eleventh grade.\n\n00:11:15.066 --> 00:11:18.065\nAnd if you want to be humbled,\ntry to teach a kid something.\n\n00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:19.938\nSo I went into this school and I said,\n\n00:11:19.962 --> 00:11:21.855\n\"Set it to 65 percent humidity.\"\n\n00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:24.145\nThe seventh grader\nsaid, \"What's humidity?\"\n\n00:11:24.169 --> 00:11:26.034\nAnd I said, \"Oh, it's water in air.\"\n\n00:11:26.058 --> 00:11:28.502\nHe said, \"There's no water\nin air, you're an idiot.\"\n\n00:11:28.526 --> 00:11:29.545\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:31.578\nAnd I was like, \"Alright, don't trust me.\n\n00:11:31.602 --> 00:11:33.261\nActually -- don't trust me, right?\n\n00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:34.436\nSet it to 100.\n\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.165\nHe sets it to 100 and what happens?\n\n00:11:36.189 --> 00:11:38.963\nIt starts to condense, make a fog\nand eventually drip.\n\n00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:42.639\nAnd he says, \"Oh. Humidity is rain.\n\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.960\nWhy didn't you just tell me that?\"\n\n00:11:44.984 --> 00:11:46.954\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:47.447 --> 00:11:50.290\nWe've created an interface\nfor this that's much like a game.\n\n00:11:50.314 --> 00:11:51.630\nThey have a 3D environment,\n\n00:11:51.654 --> 00:11:53.670\nthey can log into it anywhere in the world\n\n00:11:53.694 --> 00:11:55.477\non their smartphone, on their tablet.\n\n00:11:55.501 --> 00:11:58.928\nThey have different parts of the bots --\nthe physical, the sensors.\n\n00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.592\nThey select recipes that have\nbeen created by other kids\n\n00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:02.766\nanywhere in the world.\n\n00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.821\nThey select and activate that recipe,\nthey plant a seedling.\n\n00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:08.119\nWhile it's growing, they make changes.\n\n00:12:08.143 --> 00:12:11.152\nThey're like, \"Why does a plant\nneed CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?\n\n00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:12.327\nIt kills people.\"\n\n00:12:12.351 --> 00:12:13.722\nCrank up CO2, plant dies.\n\n00:12:14.362 --> 00:12:17.359\nOr crank down CO2, plant does very well.\n\n00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:18.573\nHarvest plant,\n\n00:12:19.088 --> 00:12:21.255\nand you've created a new digital recipe.\n\n00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:23.869\nIt's an iterative design and development\n\n00:12:23.893 --> 00:12:25.805\nand exploration process.\n\n00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.241\nThey can download, then,\n\n00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:29.982\nall of the data about that new plant\nthat they developed\n\n00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:32.292\nor the new digital recipe\nand what did it do --\n\n00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:33.760\nwas it better or was it worse?\n\n00:12:33.784 --> 00:12:35.910\nImagine these as little cores\nof processing.\n\n00:12:36.729 --> 00:12:38.696\nWe're going to learn so much.\n\n00:12:39.722 --> 00:12:42.420\nHere's one of the food computers,\nas we call them,\n\n00:12:42.444 --> 00:12:44.696\nin a school in three weeks' time.\n\n00:12:45.751 --> 00:12:47.190\nThis is three weeks of growth.\n\n00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:49.058\nBut more importantly,\n\n00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:53.042\nit was the first time that this kid\never thought he could be a farmer --\n\n00:12:53.616 --> 00:12:55.732\nor that he would want to be a farmer.\n\n00:12:56.145 --> 00:12:58.160\nSo, we've open-sourced all of this.\n\n00:12:58.184 --> 00:13:01.270\nIt's all online; go home, try to build\nyour first food computer.\n\n00:13:01.294 --> 00:13:03.683\nIt's going to be difficult --\nI'm just telling you.\n\n00:13:03.707 --> 00:13:05.771\nWe're in the beginning,\nbut it's all there.\n\n00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:08.494\nIt's very important to me\nthat this is easily accessible.\n\n00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:10.365\nWe're going to keep making it more so.\n\n00:13:10.904 --> 00:13:12.332\nThese are farmers,\n\n00:13:12.974 --> 00:13:14.951\nelectrical engineer, mechanical engineer,\n\n00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:17.008\nenvironmental engineer,\ncomputer scientist,\n\n00:13:17.032 --> 00:13:19.626\nplant scientist,\neconomist, urban planners.\n\n00:13:20.172 --> 00:13:22.926\nOn one platform, doing\nwhat they're good at.\n\n00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.774\nBut we got a little too big.\n\n00:13:24.798 --> 00:13:27.630\nThis is my new facility\nthat I'm just starting.\n\n00:13:27.654 --> 00:13:29.494\nThis warehouse could be anywhere.\n\n00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:31.311\nThat's why I chose it.\n\n00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.299\nAnd inside of this warehouse\n\n00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:35.692\nwe're going to build something\nkind of like this.\n\n00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:37.178\nThese exist right now.\n\n00:13:37.202 --> 00:13:38.429\nTake a look at it.\n\n00:13:40.011 --> 00:13:41.342\nThese exist, too.\n\n00:13:41.992 --> 00:13:43.272\nOne grows greens,\n\n00:13:43.296 --> 00:13:44.877\none grows Ebola vaccine.\n\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.084\nPretty amazing that plants\nand this DARPA Grand Challenge winner\n\n00:13:50.108 --> 00:13:52.604\nis one of the reasons\nwe're getting ahead of Ebola.\n\n00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:56.612\nThe plants are producing\nthe protein that's Ebola resistant.\n\n00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:59.579\nSo pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,\n\n00:13:59.603 --> 00:14:01.119\nall they way down to lettuce.\n\n00:14:01.578 --> 00:14:03.516\nBut these two things look nothing alike,\n\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.817\nand that's where I am with my field.\n\n00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:07.230\nEverything is different.\n\n00:14:07.587 --> 00:14:10.897\nWe're in that weird \"We're alright\" stage\n\n00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:12.784\nand it's like, \"Here's my black box --\"\n\n00:14:12.808 --> 00:14:13.959\n\"No, buy mine.\"\n\n00:14:13.983 --> 00:14:17.344\n\"No, no, no -- I've got intellectual\nproperty that's totally valuable.\n\n00:14:17.368 --> 00:14:18.568\nDon't buy his, buy mine.\"\n\n00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:20.877\nAnd the reality is,\nwe're just at the beginning,\n\n00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:23.044\nin a time when society is shifting, too.\n\n00:14:23.068 --> 00:14:24.783\nWhen we ask for more, cheaper food,\n\n00:14:24.807 --> 00:14:28.147\nwe're now asking for better,\nenvironmentally friendly food.\n\n00:14:28.612 --> 00:14:33.925\nAnd when you have McDonald's advertising\nwhat's in the Chicken McNugget,\n\n00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:36.044\nthe most mysterious\nfood item of all time --\n\n00:14:36.068 --> 00:14:38.805\nthey are now basing\ntheir marketing plan on that --\n\n00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:40.299\neverything is changing.\n\n00:14:40.323 --> 00:14:41.845\nSo into the world now.\n\n00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:43.527\nPersonal food computers,\n\n00:14:44.722 --> 00:14:45.872\nfood servers\n\n00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:48.630\nand food data centers\n\n00:14:50.392 --> 00:14:52.811\nrun on the open phenome.\n\n00:14:53.203 --> 00:14:56.432\nThink open genome, but we're going\nto put little climate recipes,\n\n00:14:56.456 --> 00:14:57.617\nlike Wikipedia,\n\n00:14:57.641 --> 00:15:01.122\nthat you can pull down, actuate and grow.\n\n00:15:03.233 --> 00:15:04.963\nWhat does this look like in a world?\n\n00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.122\nYou remember the world\nconnected by strings?\n\n00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:08.693\nWe start having beacons.\n\n00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:11.382\nWe start sending information about food,\n\n00:15:11.406 --> 00:15:12.725\nrather than sending food.\n\n00:15:13.207 --> 00:15:14.925\nThis is not just my fantasy,\n\n00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:16.987\nthis is where we're already deploying.\n\n00:15:17.536 -->

the mysterious ocean floor", "duration": "681", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_robinson_the_secrets_i_find_on_the_mysterious_ocean_floor", "transcript": "Well, I'm an ocean chemist. I look at the chemistry of the ocean today. I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past. The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals. You can see an image of one of these corals behind me. It was collected from close to Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea, so, very different than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday.So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four-dimensional view of the ocean. Two dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image of the sea surface temperature. This was taken using satellite, so it's got tremendous spatial resolution. The overall features are extremely easy to understand. The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight. The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight. And that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere. If you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea, you know it gets colder as you go down, and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense.If we travel back in time 20,000 years ago, the earth looked very much different. And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long. The icecaps were much bigger. They covered lots of the continent, and they extended out over the ocean. Sea level was 120 meters lower. Carbon dioxide [levels] were very much lower than they are today. So the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall, and much, much colder in the polar regions.What I'm trying to understand, and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand, is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today. We know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation. And we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice, you find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg. You can see those blue-white layers. Gases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 \u2014 that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past \u2014 and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions. And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day, you see that temperature increased. It didn't increase smoothly. Sometimes it increased very rapidly, then there was a plateau, then it increased rapidly. It was different in the two polar regions, and CO2 also increased in jumps.So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this. The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon, about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere. It also acts to transport heat across the equator, and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity.So if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea, we really need to get down there, see what's there and start to explore. This is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount about a kilometer deep in international waters in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land. You're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor, along with my research team. You're probably seeing new species. We don't know. You'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy. You can see beautiful bubblegum corals. There are brittle stars growing on these corals. Those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals. There are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain, and the dark sort of stuff, those are fossilized corals, and we're going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time.To do that, we need to charter a research boat. This is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel moored up in Tenerife. Looks beautiful, right? Great, if you're not a great mariner. Sometimes it looks a little more like this. This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples. Everyone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick, so it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is.So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this. You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere. It is global and it is deep, but we need to really find the right places. We just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year. This was a seven-week cruise, and this is us, having made our own maps of about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks, but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor. We're traveling from west to east, over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map, but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest. So with the maps that we make on board, we get about 100-meter resolution, enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment, but not enough to see very much. To do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor. And if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution down thousands of meters. Here is a remotely-operated vehicle, a research-grade vehicle. You can see an array of big lights on the top. There are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms, and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples.Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise, plunging down into the ocean. We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships. And we go down, and these are the kinds of things you see. These are deep sea sponges, meter scale. This is a swimming holothurian \u2014 it's a small sea slug, basically. This is slowed down. Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up, because all of this takes a lot of time. This is a beautiful holothurian as well. And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise. I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised. This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy, and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past. It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like. This wasn't what we were looking for. We were looking for corals, deep sea corals. You're going to see a picture of one in a moment. It's small, about five centimeters high. It's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there, moving in the ocean currents. An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years. And as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean. And the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals, depends on the temperature; it depends on the pH, it depends on the nutrients. And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton, we can then go back, collect fossil specimens, and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past. And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system, and we put it into a sampling container. We can do this very carefully, I should add.Some of these organisms live even longer. This is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague, Brendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii. Four thousand years is a long time. If you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up, this is about 100 microns across. And Brendan took some analyses across this coral \u2014 you can see the marks \u2014 and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands, so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean, corals can record seasonal changes, which is pretty spectacular.But 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum. So what do we do? We go in for these fossil specimens. This is what makes me really unpopular with my research team. So going along, there's giant sharks everywhere, there are pyrosomes, there are swimming holothurians, there's giant sponges, but I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor. And we pick up all these corals, bring them back, we sort them out. But each one of these is a different age, and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals, this helps us to find out what's been going on in the ocean in the past.So on the left-hand image here, I've taken a slice through a coral, polished it very carefully and taken an optical image. On the right-hand side, we've taken that same piece of coral, put it in a nuclear reactor, induced fission, and every time there's some decay, you can see that marked out in the coral, so we can see the uranium distribution. Why are we doing this? Uranium is a very poorly regarded element, but I love it. The decay helps us find out about the rates and dates of what's going on in the ocean. And if you remember from the beginning, that's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate. So we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products, thorium, in these corals, and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are.This beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean I'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks. You can see the density of the surface water in this animation by Ryan Abernathey. It's just one year of data, but you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is. The intense mixing, particularly the Drake Passage, which is shown by the box, is really one of the strongest currents in the world coming through here, flowing from west to east. It's very turbulently mixed, because it's moving over those great big undersea mountains, and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out. And essentially, the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean. We've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage, and we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating: the corals migrated from south to north during this transition from the glacial to the interglacial. We don't really know why, but we think it's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water.So here we are. I'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate from those corals in the Southern Ocean. We went up and down sea mountains. We collected little fossil corals. This is my illustration of that. We think back in the glacial, from the analysis we've made in the corals, that the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon, and there was a low-density layer sitting on top. That stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean. We then found corals that are of an intermediate age, and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition. That allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean. And then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day, or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals, we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out. So this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment.So I want to leave you with this last slide. It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you. This is a spectacular coral garden. We didn't even expect to find things this beautiful. It's thousands of meters deep. There are new species. It's just a beautiful place. There are fossils in amongst, and now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there.So next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean, just think \u2014 there are massive sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before, and there are beautiful corals.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2390, "subtitle":

today.\n\n00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:19.324\nI look at the chemistry\nof the ocean in the past.\n\n00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.412\nThe way I look back in the past\n\n00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:24.587\nis by using the fossilized remains\nof deepwater corals.\n\n00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:27.253\nYou can see an image of one\nof these corals behind me.\n\n00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:31.703\nIt was collected from close to Antarctica,\nthousands of meters below the sea,\n\n00:00:31.727 --> 00:00:33.815\nso, very different\nthan the kinds of corals\n\n00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.626\nyou may have been lucky enough to see\nif you've had a tropical holiday.\n\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.706\nSo I'm hoping that this talk will give you\n\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.523\na four-dimensional view of the ocean.\n\n00:00:41.547 --> 00:00:45.420\nTwo dimensions, such as this\nbeautiful two-dimensional image\n\n00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.038\nof the sea surface temperature.\n\n00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:51.086\nThis was taken using satellite,\nso it's got tremendous spatial resolution.\n\n00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:54.722\nThe overall features are extremely\neasy to understand.\n\n00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:58.410\nThe equatorial regions are warm\nbecause there's more sunlight.\n\n00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:01.120\nThe polar regions are cold\nbecause there's less sunlight.\n\n00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.065\nAnd that allows big icecaps\nto build up on Antarctica\n\n00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.899\nand up in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:09.675\nIf you plunge deep into the sea,\nor even put your toes in the sea,\n\n00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:11.642\nyou know it gets colder as you go down,\n\n00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:15.645\nand that's mostly because the deep waters\nthat fill the abyss of the ocean\n\n00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:18.834\ncome from the cold polar regions\nwhere the waters are dense.\n\n00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:22.909\nIf we travel back in time\n20,000 years ago,\n\n00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.793\nthe earth looked very much different.\n\n00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:28.284\nAnd I've just given you a cartoon version\nof one of the major differences\n\n00:01:28.308 --> 00:01:30.563\nyou would have seen\nif you went back that long.\n\n00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:32.269\nThe icecaps were much bigger.\n\n00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:35.920\nThey covered lots of the continent,\nand they extended out over the ocean.\n\n00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:38.437\nSea level was 120 meters lower.\n\n00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:42.005\nCarbon dioxide [levels] were very\nmuch lower than they are today.\n\n00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.673\nSo the earth was probably about three\nto five degrees colder overall,\n\n00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:48.517\nand much, much colder\nin the polar regions.\n\n00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.320\nWhat I'm trying to understand,\n\n00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.146\nand what other colleagues of mine\nare trying to understand,\n\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.629\nis how we moved from that\ncold climate condition\n\n00:01:56.653 --> 00:01:59.549\nto the warm climate condition\nthat we enjoy today.\n\n00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:01.632\nWe know from ice core research\n\n00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:04.736\nthat the transition from these\ncold conditions to warm conditions\n\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.508\nwasn't smooth, as you might predict\nfrom the slow increase in solar radiation.\n\n00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.342\nAnd we know this from ice cores,\nbecause if you drill down into ice,\n\n00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.637\nyou find annual bands of ice,\nand you can see this in the iceberg.\n\n00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:18.652\nYou can see those blue-white layers.\n\n00:02:18.676 --> 00:02:22.302\nGases are trapped in the ice cores,\nso we can measure CO2 --\n\n00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:24.691\nthat's why we know CO2\nwas lower in the past --\n\n00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:27.708\nand the chemistry of the ice\nalso tells us about temperature\n\n00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:29.207\nin the polar regions.\n\n00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:32.910\nAnd if you move in time\nfrom 20,000 years ago to the modern day,\n\n00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:34.743\nyou see that temperature increased.\n\n00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:36.392\nIt didn't increase smoothly.\n\n00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:38.194\nSometimes it increased very rapidly,\n\n00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:39.462\nthen there was a plateau,\n\n00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:40.751\nthen it increased rapidly.\n\n00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:42.799\nIt was different in the two polar regions,\n\n00:02:42.823 --> 00:02:45.552\nand CO2 also increased in jumps.\n\n00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.812\nSo we're pretty sure the ocean\nhas a lot to do with this.\n\n00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.202\nThe ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,\n\n00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.780\nabout 60 times more\nthan is in the atmosphere.\n\n00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:58.006\nIt also acts to transport heat\nacross the equator,\n\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.799\nand the ocean is full of nutrients\nand it controls primary productivity.\n\n00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.084\nSo if we want to find out\nwhat's going on down in the deep sea,\n\n00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:06.701\nwe really need to get down there,\n\n00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:07.891\nsee what's there\n\n00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:09.319\nand start to explore.\n\n00:03:09.343 --> 00:03:12.350\nThis is some spectacular footage\ncoming from a seamount\n\n00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:14.563\nabout a kilometer deep\nin international waters\n\n00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:17.567\nin the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.\n\n00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.640\nYou're amongst the first people\nto see this bit of the seafloor,\n\n00:03:20.664 --> 00:03:22.306\nalong with my research team.\n\n00:03:23.298 --> 00:03:25.042\nYou're probably seeing new species.\n\n00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:26.218\nWe don't know.\n\n00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:29.902\nYou'd have to collect the samples\nand do some very intense taxonomy.\n\n00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.819\nYou can see beautiful bubblegum corals.\n\n00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:34.097\nThere are brittle stars\ngrowing on these corals.\n\n00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.177\nThose are things that look\nlike tentacles coming out of corals.\n\n00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.073\nThere are corals made of different forms\nof calcium carbonate\n\n00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:43.473\ngrowing off the basalt of this\nmassive undersea mountain,\n\n00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:46.861\nand the dark sort of stuff,\nthose are fossilized corals,\n\n00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:49.196\nand we're going to talk\na little more about those\n\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.568\nas we travel back in time.\n\n00:03:50.988 --> 00:03:53.473\nTo do that, we need\nto charter a research boat.\n\n00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:56.537\nThis is the James Cook,\nan ocean-class research vessel\n\n00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.831\nmoored up in Tenerife.\n\n00:03:57.855 --> 00:03:59.187\nLooks beautiful, right?\n\n00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:01.342\nGreat, if you're not a great mariner.\n\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.164\nSometimes it looks\na little more like this.\n\n00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:07.387\nThis is us trying to make sure\nthat we don't lose precious samples.\n\n00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.228\nEveryone's scurrying around,\nand I get terribly seasick,\n\n00:04:10.252 --> 00:04:13.246\nso it's not always a lot of fun,\nbut overall it is.\n\n00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.856\nSo we've got to become\na really good mapper to do this.\n\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.619\nYou don't see that kind of spectacular\ncoral abundance everywhere.\n\n00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:22.683\nIt is global and it is deep,\n\n00:04:22.707 --> 00:04:25.021\nbut we need to really find\nthe right places.\n\n00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:28.211\nWe just saw a global map,\nand overlaid was our cruise passage\n\n00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:29.440\nfrom last year.\n\n00:04:29.948 --> 00:04:31.344\nThis was a seven-week cruise,\n\n00:04:31.368 --> 00:04:33.392\nand this is us, having made our own maps\n\n00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:37.487\nof about 75,000 square kilometers\nof the seafloor in seven weeks,\n\n00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.033\nbut that's only a tiny fraction\nof the seafloor.\n\n00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:41.826\nWe're traveling from west to east,\n\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.350\nover part of the ocean that would\nlook featureless on a big-scale map,\n\n00:04:45.374 --> 00:04:48.631\nbut actually some of these mountains\nare as big as Everest.\n\n00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.584\nSo with the maps that we make on board,\n\n00:04:50.608 --> 00:04:52.600\nwe get about 100-meter resolution,\n\n00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:55.513\nenough to pick out areas\nto deploy our equipment,\n\n00:04:55.537 --> 00:04:57.451\nbut not enough to see very much.\n\n00:04:57.475 --> 00:05:00.197\nTo do that, we need to fly\nremotely-operated vehicles\n\n00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:02.435\nabout five meters off the seafloor.\n\n00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:05.674\nAnd if we do that, we can get maps\nthat are one-meter resolution\n\n00:05:05.698 --> 00:05:07.792\ndown thousands of meters.\n\n00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:09.633\nHere is a remotely-operated vehicle,\n\n00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:11.968\na research-grade vehicle.\n\n00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:14.474\nYou can see an array\nof big lights on the top.\n\n00:05:14.498 --> 00:05:17.553\nThere are high-definition cameras,\nmanipulator arms,\n\n00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:20.490\nand lots of little boxes and things\nto put your samples.\n\n00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:24.763\nHere we are on our first dive\nof this particular cruise,\n\n00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:26.493\nplunging down into the ocean.\n\n00:05:26.517 --> 00:05:29.390\nWe go pretty fast to make sure\nthe remotely operated vehicles\n\n00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:31.137\nare not affected by any other ships.\n\n00:05:31.161 --> 00:05:32.359\nAnd we go down,\n\n00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:34.557\nand these are the kinds of things you see.\n\n00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:38.081\nThese are deep sea sponges, meter scale.\n\n00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:43.023\nThis is a swimming holothurian --\nit's a small sea slug, basically.\n\n00:05:43.047 --> 00:05:44.234\nThis is slowed down.\n\n00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:46.647\nMost of the footage I'm showing\nyou is speeded up,\n\n00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:48.599\nbecause all of this takes a lot of time.\n\n00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.371\nThis is a beautiful holothurian as well.\n\n00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:55.927\nAnd this animal you're going to see\ncoming up was a big surprise.\n\n00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.363\nI've never seen anything like this\nand it took us all a bit surprised.\n\n00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:02.975\nThis was after about 15 hours of work\nand we were all a bit trigger-happy,\n\n00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.736\nand suddenly this giant\nsea monster started rolling past.\n\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.866\nIt's called a pyrosome\nor colonial tunicate, if you like.\n\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.677\nThis wasn't what we were looking for.\n\n00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:13.347\nWe were looking for corals,\ndeep sea corals.\n\n00:06:14.152 --> 00:06:16.450\nYou're going to see a picture\nof one in a moment.\n\n00:06:16.474 --> 00:06:19.109\nIt's small, about five centimeters high.\n\n00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:22.451\nIt's made of calcium carbonate,\nso you can see its tentacles there,\n\n00:06:22.475 --> 00:06:24.606\nmoving in the ocean currents.\n\n00:06:25.138 --> 00:06:28.249\nAn organism like this probably lives\nfor about a hundred years.\n\n00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:31.813\nAnd as it grows, it takes in\nchemicals from the ocean.\n\n00:06:31.837 --> 00:06:34.043\nAnd the chemicals,\nor the amount of chemicals,\n\n00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:36.741\ndepends on the temperature;\nit depends on the pH,\n\n00:06:36.765 --> 00:06:38.311\nit depends on the nutrients.\n\n00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:41.569\nAnd if we can understand how\nthese chemicals get into the skeleton,\n\n00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:44.091\nwe can then go back,\ncollect fossil specimens,\n\n00:06:44.115 --> 00:06:47.259\nand reconstruct what the ocean\nused to look like in the past.\n\n00:06:47.283 --> 00:06:50.719\nAnd here you can see us collecting\nthat coral with a vacuum system,\n\n00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:53.344\nand we put it into a sampling container.\n\n00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:55.427\nWe can do this very\ncarefully, I should add.\n\n00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:57.836\nSome of these organisms live even longer.\n\n00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.262\nThis is a black coral called Leiopathes,\nan image taken by my colleague,\n\n00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:04.548\nBrendan Roark, about 500\nmeters below Hawaii.\n\n00:07:04.572 --> 00:07:06.615\nFour thousand years is a long time.\n\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.055\nIf you take a branch from one\nof these corals and polish it up,\n\n00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.372\nthis is about 100 microns across.\n\n00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:15.212\nAnd Brendan took some analyses\nacross this coral --\n\n00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.042\nyou can see the marks --\n\n00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:20.025\nand he's been able to show\nthat these are actual annual bands,\n\n00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:21.962\nso even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,\n\n00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:24.754\ncorals can record seasonal changes,\n\n00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.510\nwhich is pretty spectacular.\n\n00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:30.332\nBut 4,000 years is not enough to get\nus back to our last glacial maximum.\n\n00:07:30.356 --> 00:07:31.514\nSo what do we do?\n\n00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:33.545\nWe go in for these fossil specimens.\n\n00:07:34.138 --> 00:07:37.069\nThis is what makes me really unpopular\nwith my research team.\n\n00:07:37.093 --> 00:07:38.243\nSo going along,\n\n00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:39.885\nthere's giant sharks everywhere,\n\n00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:42.407\nthere are pyrosomes,\nthere are swimming holothurians,\n\n00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:43.702\nthere's giant sponges,\n\n00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:46.321\nbut I make everyone go down\nto these dead fossil areas\n\n00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:49.901\nand spend ages kind of shoveling\naround on the seafloor.\n\n00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:53.290\nAnd we pick up all these corals,\nbring them back, we sort them out.\n\n00:07:53.314 --> 00:07:55.609\nBut each one of these is a different age,\n\n00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:57.534\nand if we can find out how old they are\n\n00:07:57.558 --> 00:08:00.070\nand then we can measure\nthose chemical signals,\n\n00:08:00.094 --> 00:08:01.516\nthis helps us to find out\n\n00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.023\nwhat's been going on\nin the ocean in the past.\n\n00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:06.220\nSo on the left-hand image here,\n\n00:08:06.244 --> 00:08:09.276\nI've taken a slice through a coral,\npolished it very carefully\n\n00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.270\nand taken an optical image.\n\n00:08:11.294 --> 00:08:12.446\nOn the right-hand side,\n\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.570\nwe've taken that same piece of coral,\nput it in a nuclear reactor,\n\n00:08:15.594 --> 00:08:16.746\ninduced fission,\n\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.401\nand every time there's some decay,\n\n00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:20.407\nyou can see that marked out in the coral,\n\n00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:22.320\nso we can see the uranium distribution.\n\n00:08:22.344 --> 00:08:23.495\nWhy are we doing this?\n\n00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.806\nUranium is a very poorly regarded element,\n\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.989\nbut I love it.\n\n00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:30.225\nThe decay helps us find out\nabout the rates and dates\n\n00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:31.788\nof what's going on in the ocean.\n\n00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:33.710\nAnd if you remember from the beginning,\n\n00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:36.747\nthat's what we want to get at\nwhen we're thinking about climate.\n\n00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:38.522\nSo we use a laser to analyze uranium\n\n00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:41.331\nand one of its daughter products,\nthorium, in these corals,\n\n00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:43.994\nand that tells us exactly\nhow old the fossils are.\n\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.892\nThis beautiful animation\nof the Southern Ocean\n\n00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:50.051\nI'm just going to use illustrate\nhow we're using these corals\n\n00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:54.146\nto get at some of the ancient\nocean feedbacks.\n\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.596\nYou can see the density\nof the surface water\n\n00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.018\nin this animation by Ryan Abernathey.\n\n00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:01.476\nIt's just one year of data,\n\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.110\nbut you can see how dynamic\nthe Southern Ocean is.\n\n00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:07.865\nThe intense mixing,\nparticularly the Drake Passage,\n\n00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:10.326\nwhich is shown by the box,\n\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.962\nis really one of the strongest\ncurrents in the world\n\n00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.193\ncoming through here,\nflowing from west to east.\n\n00:09:15.217 --> 00:09:16.566\nIt's very turbulently mixed,\n\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.462\nbecause it's moving over those\ngreat big undersea mountains,\n\n00:09:19.486 --> 00:09:23.967\nand this allows CO2 and heat to exchange\nwith the atmosphere in and out.\n\n00:09:23.991 --> 00:09:27.498\nAnd essentially, the oceans are breathing\nthrough the Southern Ocean.\n\n00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:34.287\nWe've collected corals from back and forth\nacross this Antarctic passage,\n\n00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:37.338\nand we've found quite a surprising thing\nfrom my uranium dating:\n\n00:09:37.362 --> 00:09:39.865\nthe corals migrated from south to north\n\n00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:43.018\nduring this transition from the glacial\nto the interglacial.\n\n00:09:43.042 --> 00:09:44.249\nWe don't really know why,\n\n00:09:44.273 --> 00:09:46.822\nbut we think it's something\nto do with the food source\n\n00:09:46.846 --> 00:09:48.803\nand maybe the oxygen in the water.\n\n00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:50.831\nSo here we are.\n\n00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:53.903\nI'm going to illustrate what I think\nwe've found about climate\n\n00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.887\nfrom those corals in the Southern Ocean.\n\n00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:59.186\nWe went up and down sea mountains.\nWe collected little fossil corals.\n\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.736\nThis is my illustration of that.\n\n00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.165\nWe think back in the glacial,\n\n00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:04.212\nfrom the analysis\nwe've made in the corals,\n\n00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.322\nthat the deep part of the Southern Ocean\nwas very rich in carbon,\n\n00:10:07.346 --> 00:10:10.035\nand there was a low-density\nlayer sitting on top.\n\n00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:12.852\nThat stops carbon dioxide\ncoming out of the ocean.\n\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.302\nWe then found corals\nthat are of an intermediate age,\n\n00:10:16.326 --> 00:10:20.906\nand they show us that the ocean mixed\npartway through that climate transition.\n\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.397\nThat allows carbon to come\nout of the deep ocean.\n\n00:10:24.112 --> 00:10:27.211\nAnd then if we analyze corals\ncloser to the modern day,\n\n00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:29.489\nor indeed if we go down there today anyway\n\n00:10:29.513 --> 00:10:31.719\nand measure the chemistry of the corals,\n\n00:10:31.743 --> 00:10:35.737\nwe see that we move to a position\nwhere carbon can exchange in and out.\n\n00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.835\nSo this is the way\nwe can use fossil corals\n\n00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:39.801\nto help us learn about the environment.\n\n00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:43.919\nSo I want to leave you\nwith this last slide.\n\n00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:47.866\nIt's just a still taken out of that first\npiece of footage that I showed you.\n\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.002\nThis is a spectacular coral garden.\n\n00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:52.584\nWe didn't even expect\nto find things this beautiful.\n\n00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:54.492\nIt's thousands of meters deep.\n\n00:10:54.516 --> 00:10:55.890\nThere are new species.\n\n00:10:56.374 --> 00:10:58.273\nIt's just a beautiful place.\n\n00:10:58.297 --> 00:10:59.678\nThere are fossils in amongst,\n\n00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:02.393\nand now I've trained you\nto appreciate the fossil corals\n\n00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:03.632\nthat are down there.\n\n00:11:03.656 --> 00:11:06.522\nSo next time you're lucky enough\nto fly over the ocean\n\n00:11:06.546 --> 00:11:07.955\nor sail over the ocean,\n\n00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:10.646\njust think -- there are massive\nsea mountains down there\n\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.537\nthat nobody's ever seen before,\n\n00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:14.178\nand there are beautiful corals.\n\n00:11:14.202 --> 00:11:15.353\nThank you.\n\n00:11:15.377

"transcript": "In India, we have these huge families. I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it. Which means that there are a lot of family events. So as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.But the one thing that I always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins. And there was always this one uncle who used to be there, always ready, jumping around with us, having games for us, making us kids have the time of our lives. This man was extremely successful: he was confident and powerful. But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.Parkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system, which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult. My uncle started using a walker to walk, and to take a turn, he literally had to take one step at a time, like this, and it took forever. So this person, who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering, was suddenly hiding behind people. He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.And he's not the only one in the world. Every year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's, and this number is only rising. As designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems, one solution that solves it all, but it need not always be like that. You can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact. So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's, but to make their everyday tasks much more simple, and then make an impact.Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right? My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment, so, well, I designed the no-spill cup. It works just purely on its form. The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors, and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup. But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product. It looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person, and that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in. So, well, one problem solved, many more to go.All this while, I was interviewing him, questioning him, and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information, or just answers to my questions. But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective. So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks, while he's eating, while he's watching TV. And then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table, it struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land, how does he climb a staircase? Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries. One actually has to climb the stairs. So he told me, \"Well, let me show you how I do it.\" Let's take a look at what I saw.So he took really long to reach this position, and then all this while, I'm thinking, \"Oh my God, is he really going to do it? Is he really, really going to do it without his walker?\" And then ...(Laughter)And the turns, he took them so easily.So \u2014 shocked? Well, I was too. So this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.On researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion. There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker, but the moment he's put on a cycle, all his symptoms vanish, because it is a continuous motion. So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land. And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him, but the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.(Laughter)(Applause)He walked faster, right?(Applause)I call this the staircase illusion, and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze, and this is called freezing of gait. So it happens a lot, so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms, making them feel much more confident? You know, technology is not always it. What we need are human-centered solutions. I could have easily made it into a projection, or a Google Glass, or something like that. But I stuck to simple print on the floor. This print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome.What I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient feel like my uncle felt that day. He told me that I made him feel like his old self again.\"Smart\" in today's world has become synonymous to high tech, and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day. But why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective? All we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity, to go out there, observe. But let's not stop at that. Let's find these complex problems. Don't be scared of them. Break them, boil them down into much smaller problems, and then find simple solutions for them. Test these solutions, fail if needed, but with newer insights to make it better. Imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions. What would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions? Let's make a smarter world, but with simplicity.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2454, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:15.774\nIn India, we

person who could not\nwalk on flat land\n\n00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:24.358\nwas suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.\n\n00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:30.333\nOn researching this, I realized that\nit's because it's a continuous motion.\n\n00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:33.494\nThere's this other man\nwho also suffers from the same symptoms\n\n00:04:33.518 --> 00:04:34.934\nand uses a walker,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.054\nbut the moment he's put on a cycle,\n\n00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:38.774\nall his symptoms vanish,\n\n00:04:38.798 --> 00:04:40.878\nbecause it is a continuous motion.\n\n00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:45.814\nSo the key for me was to translate\nthis feeling of walking on a staircase\n\n00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:47.238\nback to flat land.\n\n00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:50.774\nAnd a lot of ideas\nwere tested and tried on him,\n\n00:04:50.798 --> 00:04:54.318\nbut the one that finally worked\nwas this one. Let's take a look.\n\n00:04:57.398 --> 00:05:00.454\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:00.478 --> 00:05:04.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.414\nHe walked faster, right?\n\n00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:09.638\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:11.198 --> 00:05:13.974\nI call this the staircase illusion,\n\n00:05:13.998 --> 00:05:18.574\nand actually when the staircase illusion\nabruptly ended, he froze,\n\n00:05:18.598 --> 00:05:20.614\nand this is called freezing of gait.\n\n00:05:20.638 --> 00:05:21.854\nSo it happens a lot,\n\n00:05:21.878 --> 00:05:25.814\nso why not have a staircase illusion\nflowing through all their rooms,\n\n00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:28.198\nmaking them feel much more confident?\n\n00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:32.054\nYou know, technology is not always it.\n\n00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:34.854\nWhat we need are human-centered solutions.\n\n00:05:34.878 --> 00:05:37.094\nI could have easily\nmade it into a projection,\n\n00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:39.454\nor a Google Glass, or something like that.\n\n00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:41.798\nBut I stuck to simple print on the floor.\n\n00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:45.254\nThis print could be taken into hospitals\n\n00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:47.678\nto make them feel much more welcome.\n\n00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:51.654\nWhat I wish to do\nis make every Parkinson's patient\n\n00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:54.134\nfeel like my uncle felt that day.\n\n00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:57.838\nHe told me that I made him feel\nlike his old self again.\n\n00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:03.078\n\"Smart\" in today's world\nhas become synonymous to high tech,\n\n00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:07.078\nand the world is only getting\nsmarter and smarter day by day.\n\n00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:11.438\nBut why can't smart be something\nthat's simple and yet effective?\n\n00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:16.254\nAll we need is a little bit of empathy\nand some curiosity,\n\n00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:18.534\nto go out there, observe.\n\n00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:20.454\nBut let's not stop at that.\n\n00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:24.134\nLet's find these complex problems.\nDon't be scared of them.\n\n00:06:24.158 --> 00:06:27.734\nBreak them, boil them down\ninto much smaller problems,\n\n00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:30.254\nand then find simple solutions for them.\n\n00:06:30.278 --> 00:06:33.294\nTest these solutions, fail if needed,\n\n00:06:33.318 --> 00:06:35.478\nbut with newer insights to make it better.\n\n00:06:36.198 --> 00:06:40.454\nImagine what we all could do\nif we all came up with simple solutions.\n\n00:06:40.478 --> 00:06:43.958\nWhat would the world be like\nif we combined all our simple solutions?\n\n00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:47.854\nLet's make a smarter world,\nbut with simplicity.\n\n00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:49.094\nThank you.\n\n00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:52.158\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "This country isn't just carbon neutral -- it's carbon negative", "duration": "1134", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tshering_tobgay_this_country_isn_t_just_carbon_neutral_it_s_carbon_negative", "transcript": "In case you are wondering, no, I'm not wearing a dress, and no, I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath.(Laughter)This is a gho. This is my national dress. This is how all men dress in Bhutan. That is how our women dress. Like our women, we men get to wear pretty bright colors, but unlike our women, we get to show off our legs.(Laughter)Our national dress is unique, but this is not the only thing that's unique about my country. Our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique, and this is what I'd like to speak about today, our promise to remain carbon neutral.But before I proceed, I should set you the context. I should tell you our story.Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas. We've been called Shangri-La, even the last Shangri-La. But let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La. My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks.(Laughter)The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth, China and India. The reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country doing our best to survive. But we are doing OK. We are surviving. In fact, we are thriving, and the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed with extraordinary kings. Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country, balancing economic growth carefully with social development, environmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within the framework of good governance. We call this holistic approach to development \"Gross National Happiness,\" or GNH. Back in the 1970s, our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan, Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.(Applause)Ever since, all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH, a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness and well-being of our people.But that's easier said than done, especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world. Our entire GDP is less than two billion dollars. I know that some of you here are worth more \u2014(Laughter)individually than the entire economy of my country.So our economy is small, but here is where it gets interesting. Education is completely free. All citizens are guaranteed free school education, and those that work hard are given free college education. Healthcare is also completely free. Medical consultation, medical treatment, medicines: they are all provided by the state. We manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully, and because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH, which is development with values. Our economy is small, and we must strengthen it. Economic growth is important, but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment.Today, our culture is flourishing. We continue to celebrate our art and architecture, food and festivals, monks and monasteries. And yes, we celebrate our national dress, too. This is why I can wear my gho with pride. Here's a fun fact: you're looking at the world's biggest pocket.(Laughter)It starts here, goes around the back, and comes out from inside here. In this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to iPads, office files and books.(Laughter)(Applause)But sometimes \u2014 sometimes even precious cargo.So our culture is flourishing, but so is our environment. 72 percent of my country is under forest cover. Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent of Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover for all time.(Applause)Our constitution, this constitution, imposes forest cover on us. Incidentally, our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us. You see, we the people didn't want democracy. We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it, and we certainly didn't fight for it. Instead, our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he include it in the constitution. But he went further. He included provisions in the constitution that empower the people to impeach their kings, and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire at the age of 65.(Applause)Fact is, we already have a king in retirement: our previous king, the Great Fourth, retired 10 years ago at the peak of his popularity. He was all of 51 years at that time.So as I was saying, 72 percent of our country is under forest cover, and all that forest is pristine. That's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world, and that's why we are a carbon neutral country. In a world that is threatened with climate change, we are a carbon neutral country.Turns out, it's a big deal. Of the 200-odd countries in the world today, it looks like we are the only one that's carbon neutral. Actually, that's not quite accurate. Bhutan is not carbon neutral. Bhutan is carbon negative. Our entire country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount, so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year. But that's not all.(Applause)We export most of the renewable electricity we generate from our fast-flowing rivers. So today, the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood. By 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide. And if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential, and that's exactly what we are working at, the clean, green energy that we export would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. That is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year.So inside our country, we are a net carbon sink. Outside, we are offsetting carbon. And this is important stuff. You see, the world is getting warmer, and climate change is a reality. Climate change is affecting my country. Our glaciers are melting, causing flash floods and landslides, which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country. I was at that lake recently. It's stunning. That's how it looked 10 years ago, and that's how it looked 20 years ago. Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist. It was a solid glacier. A few years ago, a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below. That destruction was caused by one glacier lake. We have 2,700 of them to contend with. The point is this: my country and my people have done nothing to contribute to global warming, but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences. And for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous, it is very difficult. But we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing. We will fight climate change. That's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral.We first made this promise in 2009 during COP 15 in Copenhagen, but nobody noticed. Governments were so busy arguing with one another and blaming each other for causing climate change, that when a small country raised our hands and announced, \"We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time,\" nobody heard us. Nobody cared.Last December in Paris, at COP 21, we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come. This time, we were heard. We were noticed, and everybody cared. What was different in Paris was that governments came round together to accept the realities of climate change, and were willing to come together and act together and work together. All countries, from the very small to the very large, committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change says that if these so-called intended commitments are kept, we'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees Celsius.By the way, I've requested the TED organizers here to turn up the heat in here by two degrees, so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual, you know who to blame.It's crucial that all of us keep our commitments. As far as Bhutan is concerned, we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral. Here are some of the ways we are doing it. We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers. The idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food. We are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles. Similarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights, and our entire government is trying to go paperless. We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program, and we are planting trees throughout our country through Green Bhutan, another national program.But it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy. Our protected areas are our carbon sink. They are our lungs. Today, more than half our country is protected, as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. But the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors. Now, what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country. Take this tiger, for example. It was spotted at 250 meters above sea level in the hot, subtropical jungles. Two years later, that same tiger was spotted near 4,000 meters in our cold alpine mountains. Isn't that awesome?(Applause)We must keep it that way. We must keep our parks awesome. So every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting, mining and pollution in our parks, and resources to help communities who live in those parks manage their forests, adapt to climate change, and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature.But that is expensive. Over the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment. In fact, when we run the numbers, it looks like it'll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts. But neither Bhutan, nor the world can afford to spend 15 years going backwards.This is why His Majesty the King started Bhutan For Life. Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need. It gives us breathing room. It is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks, to protect our parks, until our government can take over on our own fully. The idea is to raise a transition fund from individual donors, corporations and institutions, but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed. So multiparty, single closing: an idea we borrowed from Wall Street. This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry that they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan. It's something like a Kickstarter project, only with a 15-year time horizon and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake. Once the deal is closed, we use the transition fund to protect our parks, giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period. After that, our government guarantees full funding forever.We are almost there. We expect to close later this year. Naturally, I'm pretty excited.(Applause)The World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey, and I want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan and across the world.(Applause)Whew, it is getting warm in here.I thank you for listening to our story, a story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral, a story of how we are keeping our country pristine, for ourselves, our children, for your children and for the world. But we are not here to tell stories, are we? We are here to dream together. So in closing, I'd like to share one more dream that I have. What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources, our influence and our passion, to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries so that they too can conserve their protected areas for all time. After all, there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face. They too have natural resources that can help win the world's fight for sustainability, only they may not have the ability to invest in them now. So what if we set up Earth For Life, a global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world? I invite you to help me, to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care about our planet's future. After all, we're here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to protect our planet together. Because the reality is we are in it together. Some of us might dress differently, but we are in it together.Thank you very much, and kadrin chhe la.

growth is important,\n\n00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:09.814\nbut that economic growth must not come\nfrom undermining our unique culture\n\n00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:12.918\nor our pristine environment.\n\n00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:16.318\nToday, our culture is flourishing.\n\n00:04:17.038 --> 00:04:20.734\nWe continue to celebrate\nour art and architecture,\n\n00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:22.358\nfood and festivals,\n\n00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:25.918\nmonks and monasteries.\n\n00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:30.598\nAnd yes, we celebrate\nour national dress, too.\n\n00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:35.958\nThis is why I can wear my gho with pride.\n\n00:04:37.158 --> 00:04:38.398\nHere's a fun fact:\n\n00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.078\nyou're looking\nat the world's biggest pocket.\n\n00:04:42.718 --> 00:04:45.054\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:47.094\nIt starts here,\n\n00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:49.294\ngoes around the back,\n\n00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:51.798\nand comes out from inside here.\n\n00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.854\nIn this pocket\n\n00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:56.894\nwe store all manner of personal goods\n\n00:04:56.918 --> 00:04:58.838\nfrom phones and wallets\n\n00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:03.254\nto iPads, office files and books.\n\n00:05:03.278 --> 00:05:04.494\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:06.214\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:08.774\nBut sometimes --\n\n00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:11.798\nsometimes even precious cargo.\n\n00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:15.758\nSo our culture is flourishing,\n\n00:05:16.518 --> 00:05:18.974\nbut so is our environment.\n\n00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:22.398\n72 percent of my country\nis under forest cover.\n\n00:05:23.398 --> 00:05:28.374\nOur constitution demands\nthat a minimum of 60 percent\n\n00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:32.094\nof Bhutan's total land\nshall remain under forest cover\n\n00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:33.334\nfor all time.\n\n00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:35.878\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.558\nOur constitution,\n\n00:05:41.198 --> 00:05:42.758\nthis constitution,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.198\nimposes forest cover on us.\n\n00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:52.054\nIncidentally, our king\nused this constitution\n\n00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:53.838\nto impose democracy on us.\n\n00:05:54.598 --> 00:05:57.774\nYou see, we the people\ndidn't want democracy.\n\n00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:00.774\nWe didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,\n\n00:06:00.798 --> 00:06:02.598\nand we certainly didn't fight for it.\n\n00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:07.934\nInstead, our king imposed democracy on us\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.798\nby insisting that he include it\nin the constitution.\n\n00:06:12.478 --> 00:06:13.718\nBut he went further.\n\n00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:17.078\nHe included provisions in the constitution\n\n00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:21.318\nthat empower the people\nto impeach their kings,\n\n00:06:22.038 --> 00:06:27.574\nand included provisions in here\nthat require all our kings to retire\n\n00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:29.038\nat the age of 65.\n\n00:06:30.398 --> 00:06:31.854\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:31.878 --> 00:06:36.198\nFact is, we already have\na king in retirement:\n\n00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:40.094\nour previous king, the Great Fourth,\n\n00:06:40.118 --> 00:06:42.574\nretired 10 years ago\n\n00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:44.878\nat the peak of his popularity.\n\n00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:49.638\nHe was all of 51 years at that time.\n\n00:06:51.038 --> 00:06:52.358\nSo as I was saying,\n\n00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:56.854\n72 percent of our country\nis under forest cover,\n\n00:06:56.878 --> 00:06:59.118\nand all that forest is pristine.\n\n00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:02.054\nThat's why we are one of the few remaining\n\n00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:05.094\nglobal biodiversity hotspots in the world,\n\n00:07:05.118 --> 00:07:07.478\nand that's why we are\na carbon neutral country.\n\n00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:10.654\nIn a world that is threatened\nwith climate change,\n\n00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:13.598\nwe are a carbon neutral country.\n\n00:07:15.438 --> 00:07:17.198\nTurns out, it's a big deal.\n\n00:07:17.878 --> 00:07:20.254\nOf the 200-odd countries\nin the world today,\n\n00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:22.038\nit looks like we are the only one\n\n00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:23.758\nthat's carbon neutral.\n\n00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.438\nActually, that's not quite accurate.\n\n00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:30.838\nBhutan is not carbon neutral.\n\n00:07:31.878 --> 00:07:34.198\nBhutan is carbon negative.\n\n00:07:35.558 --> 00:07:42.494\nOur entire country generates\n2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,\n\n00:07:42.518 --> 00:07:46.358\nbut our forests, they sequester\nmore than three times that amount,\n\n00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:49.814\nso we are a net carbon sink\n\n00:07:49.838 --> 00:07:53.758\nfor more than four million tons\nof carbon dioxide each year.\n\n00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:56.374\nBut that's not all.\n\n00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:58.494\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:01.614\nWe export most\nof the renewable electricity\n\n00:08:01.638 --> 00:08:03.798\nwe generate from our fast-flowing rivers.\n\n00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.534\nSo today, the clean energy that we export\n\n00:08:08.558 --> 00:08:13.638\noffsets about six million tons\nof carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.\n\n00:08:14.198 --> 00:08:18.134\nBy 2020, we'll be exporting\nenough electricity\n\n00:08:18.158 --> 00:08:21.838\nto offset 17 million tons\nof carbon dioxide.\n\n00:08:22.638 --> 00:08:25.894\nAnd if we were to harness\neven half our hydropower potential,\n\n00:08:25.918 --> 00:08:27.958\nand that's exactly what we are working at,\n\n00:08:29.078 --> 00:08:31.454\nthe clean, green energy that we export\n\n00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:36.598\nwould offset something like\n50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.\n\n00:08:38.278 --> 00:08:44.158\nThat is more CO2 than what the entire city\nof New York generates in one year.\n\n00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:48.214\nSo inside our country,\nwe are a net carbon sink.\n\n00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:50.774\nOutside, we are offsetting carbon.\n\n00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:52.158\nAnd this is important stuff.\n\n00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:54.997\nYou see, the world is getting warmer,\n\n00:08:55.798 --> 00:08:58.078\nand climate change is a reality.\n\n00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:01.638\nClimate change is affecting my country.\n\n00:09:02.238 --> 00:09:03.678\nOur glaciers are melting,\n\n00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:06.814\ncausing flash floods and landslides,\n\n00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:11.278\nwhich in turn are causing disaster\nand widespread destruction in our country.\n\n00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:15.158\nI was at that lake recently.\n\n00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:16.958\nIt's stunning.\n\n00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:21.174\nThat's how it looked 10 years ago,\n\n00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:23.798\nand that's how it looked 20 years ago.\n\n00:09:24.278 --> 00:09:27.118\nJust 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.\n\n00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:29.638\nIt was a solid glacier.\n\n00:09:31.478 --> 00:09:33.518\nA few years ago, a similar lake\n\n00:09:34.718 --> 00:09:36.118\nbreached its dams\n\n00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:40.118\nand wreaked havoc in the valleys below.\n\n00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:45.334\nThat destruction\nwas caused by one glacier lake.\n\n00:09:45.358 --> 00:09:49.278\nWe have 2,700 of them to contend with.\n\n00:09:50.598 --> 00:09:51.838\nThe point is this:\n\n00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:56.574\nmy country and my people have done nothing\n\n00:09:56.598 --> 00:09:58.478\nto contribute to global warming,\n\n00:09:59.878 --> 00:10:03.998\nbut we are already bearing the brunt\nof its consequences.\n\n00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:09.534\nAnd for a small, poor country,\none that is landlocked and mountainous,\n\n00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:11.318\nit is very difficult.\n\n00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.894\nBut we are not going to sit\non our hands doing nothing.\n\n00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:16.318\nWe will fight climate change.\n\n00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:20.438\nThat's why we have promised\nto remain carbon neutral.\n\n00:10:22.438 --> 00:10:26.774\nWe first made this promise in 2009\n\n00:10:26.798 --> 00:10:29.558\nduring COP 15 in Copenhagen,\n\n00:10:30.758 --> 00:10:31.958\nbut nobody noticed.\n\n00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:35.574\nGovernments were so busy\narguing with one another\n\n00:10:35.598 --> 00:10:38.534\nand blaming each other\nfor causing climate change,\n\n00:10:38.558 --> 00:10:42.214\nthat when a small country\nraised our hands and announced,\n\n00:10:42.238 --> 00:10:45.334\n\"We promise to remain\ncarbon neutral for all time,\"\n\n00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:46.558\nnobody heard us.\n\n00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:49.038\nNobody cared.\n\n00:10:51.358 --> 00:10:53.158\nLast December in Paris,\n\n00:10:54.438 --> 00:10:57.694\nat COP 21, we reiterated our promise\n\n00:10:57.718 --> 00:11:00.278\nto remain carbon neutral\nfor all time to come.\n\n00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:03.038\nThis time, we were heard.\n\n00:11:03.838 --> 00:11:06.238\nWe were noticed, and everybody cared.\n\n00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:14.094\nWhat was different in Paris\nwas that governments came round together\n\n00:11:14.118 --> 00:11:16.734\nto accept the realities of climate change,\n\n00:11:16.758 --> 00:11:20.118\nand were willing to come together\nand act together and work together.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.118\nAll countries, from the very small\nto the very large,\n\n00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:29.318\ncommitted to reduce\nthe greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n00:11:30.638 --> 00:11:33.734\nThe UN Framework Convention\non Climate Change\n\n00:11:33.758 --> 00:11:38.518\nsays that if these so-called\nintended commitments are kept,\n\n00:11:39.358 --> 00:11:41.574\nwe'd be closer\nto containing global warming\n\n00:11:41.598 --> 00:11:42.958\nby two degrees Celsius.\n\n00:11:46.398 --> 00:11:47.598\nBy the way,\n\n00:11:48.598 --> 00:11:51.334\nI've requested the TED organizers here\n\n00:11:51.358 --> 00:11:55.238\nto turn up the heat in here\nby two degrees,\n\n00:11:56.478 --> 00:11:59.294\nso if some of you\nare feeling warmer than usual,\n\n00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:00.518\nyou know who to blame.\n\n00:12:03.478 --> 00:12:07.118\nIt's crucial that all of us\nkeep our commitments.\n\n00:12:07.558 --> 00:12:09.014\nAs far as Bhutan is concerned,\n\n00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:12.478\nwe will keep our promise\nto remain carbon neutral.\n\n00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:15.558\nHere are some of the ways we are doing it.\n\n00:12:16.718 --> 00:12:19.558\nWe are providing free electricity\nto our rural farmers.\n\n00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:26.494\nThe idea is that, with free electricity,\nthey will no longer have to use firewood\n\n00:12:26.518 --> 00:12:27.718\nto cook their food.\n\n00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:31.294\nWe are investing in sustainable transport\n\n00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:34.774\nand subsidizing the purchase\nof electric vehicles.\n\n00:12:34.798 --> 00:12:38.934\nSimilarly, we are subsidizing\nthe cost of LED lights,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:43.254\nand our entire government\nis trying to go paperless.\n\n00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:47.774\nWe are cleaning up our entire country\nthrough Clean Bhutan, a national program,\n\n00:12:47.798 --> 00:12:50.934\nand we are planting trees\nthroughout our country\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.398\nthrough Green Bhutan,\n\n00:12:53.118 --> 00:12:55.238\nanother national program.\n\n00:12:56.278 --> 00:12:58.454\nBut it is our protected areas\n\n00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:01.798\nthat are at the core\nof our carbon neutral strategy.\n\n00:13:02.278 --> 00:13:05.494\nOur protected areas are our carbon sink.\n\n00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:07.318\nThey are our lungs.\n\n00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:12.334\nToday, more than half\nour country is protected,\n\n00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.734\nas national parks, nature reserves\n\n00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:16.678\nand wildlife sanctuaries.\n\n00:13:17.358 --> 00:13:21.454\nBut the beauty is that we've connected\nthem all with one another\n\n00:13:21.478 --> 00:13:24.398\nthrough a network of biological corridors.\n\n00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:27.334\nNow, what this means\n\n00:13:27.358 --> 00:13:31.278\nis that our animals are free\nto roam throughout our country.\n\n00:13:33.718 --> 00:13:35.134\nTake this tiger, for example.\n\n00:13:35.158 --> 00:13:38.854\nIt was spotted\nat 250 meters above sea level\n\n00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:41.198\nin the hot, subtropical jungles.\n\n00:13:41.998 --> 00:13:44.974\nTwo years later, that same tiger\n\n00:13:44.998 --> 00:13:48.494\nwas spotted near 4,000 meters\n\n00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:51.038\nin our cold alpine mountains.\n\n00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:52.998\nIsn't that awesome?\n\n00:13:53.678 --> 00:13:57.734\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:57.758 --> 00:13:59.598\nWe must keep it that way.\n\n00:14:00.438 --> 00:14:02.518\nWe must keep our parks awesome.\n\n00:14:03.798 --> 00:14:08.494\nSo every year, we set aside resources\nto prevent poaching, hunting,\n\n00:14:08.518 --> 00:14:10.894\nmining and pollution in our parks,\n\n00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:16.054\nand resources to help communities\nwho live in those parks\n\n00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:17.574\nmanage their forests,\n\n00:14:17.598 --> 00:14:19.054\nadapt to climate change,\n\n00:14:19.078 --> 00:14:23.078\nand lead better lives while continuing\nto live in harmony with Mother Nature.\n\n00:14:24.558 --> 00:14:25.798\nBut that is expensive.\n\n00:14:26.598 --> 00:14:32.334\nOver the next few years,\nour small economy won't have the resources\n\n00:14:32.358 --> 00:14:36.078\nto cover all the costs that are required\nto protect our environment.\n\n00:14:37.518 --> 00:14:39.134\nIn fact, when we run the numbers,\n\n00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:41.854\nit looks like it'll take us\nat least 15 years\n\n00:14:41.878 --> 00:14:46.038\nbefore we can fully finance\nall our conservation efforts.\n\n00:14:47.238 --> 00:14:48.478\nBut neither Bhutan,\n\n00:14:49.678 --> 00:14:50.878\nnor the world\n\n00:14:51.438 --> 00:14:54.598\ncan afford to spend 15 years\ngoing backwards.\n\n00:14:56.558 --> 00:14:58.798\nThis is why His Majesty the King\n\n00:14:59.678 --> 00:15:01.318\nstarted Bhutan For Life.\n\n00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:04.854\nBhutan For Life gives us the time we need.\n\n00:15:04.878 --> 00:15:06.278\nIt gives us breathing room.\n\n00:15:07.078 --> 00:15:09.454\nIt is essentially a funding mechanism\n\n00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:11.414\nto look after our parks,\n\n00:15:11.438 --> 00:15:12.878\nto protect our parks,\n\n00:15:13.638 --> 00:15:16.518\nuntil our government\ncan take over on our own fully.\n\n00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:21.454\nThe idea is to raise a transition fund\n\n00:15:21.478 --> 00:15:24.798\nfrom individual donors,\ncorporations and institutions,\n\n00:15:25.798 --> 00:15:30.334\nbut the deal is closed only\nafter predetermined conditions are met\n\n00:15:30.358 --> 00:15:31.958\nand all funds committed.\n\n00:15:32.878 --> 00:15:35.798\nSo multiparty, single closing:\n\n00:15:36.318 --> 00:15:38.478\nan idea we borrowed from Wall Street.\n\n00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:43.934\nThis means that individual donors\ncan commit without having to worry\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:47.918\nthat they'll be left\nsupporting an underfunded plan.\n\n00:15:49.438 --> 00:15:51.694\nIt's something like a Kickstarter project,\n\n00:15:51.718 --> 00:15:54.094\nonly with a 15-year time horizon\n\n00:15:54.118 --> 00:15:57.438\nand millions of tons\nof carbon dioxide at stake.\n\n00:15:58.358 --> 00:16:00.078\nOnce the deal is closed,\n\n00:16:01.278 --> 00:16:05.334\nwe use the transition fund\nto protect our parks,\n\n00:16:05.358 --> 00:16:10.534\ngiving our government time\nto increase our own funding gradually\n\n00:16:10.558 --> 00:16:12.574\nuntil the end of the 15-year period.\n\n00:16:12.598 --> 00:16:18.158\nAfter that, our government\nguarantees full funding forever.\n\n00:16:20.078 --> 00:16:21.278\nWe are almost there.\n\n00:16:21.758 --> 00:16:23.598\nWe expect to close later this year.\n\n00:16:24.598 --> 00:16:26.294\nNaturally, I'm pretty excited.\n\n00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:29.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:38.278\nThe World Wildlife Fund\nis our principle partner in this journey,\n\n00:16:38.918 --> 00:16:40.974\nand I want to give them a big shoutout\n\n00:16:40.998 --> 00:16:43.318\nfor the excellent work\nthey are doing in Bhutan\n\n00:16:44.118 --> 00:16:45.374\nand across the world.\n\n00:16:45.398 -->

00:17:53.880\nAfter all, there are many other countries\nwho face the same issues that we face.\n\n00:17:53.904 --> 00:17:56.094\nThey too have natural resources\n\n00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:59.038\nthat

Packed into a room just like this, but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric, with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them. A room like this, nonetheless. With the same great feelings of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention.(Laughter)This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it. I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability. And once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.So I went to church as often as I could. I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early.And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the \"Left Behind\" books that were all the rage at the time. And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight, I had another shot. All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself. It would be hard \u2014(Laughter)but I knew I could do it.(Laughter)But planning time was over now. It was 11:50pm. We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck. So every faction of the congregation took its place. The choir stayed in the choir stand, the deacons and their wives \u2014 or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them \u2014(Laughter)took first position in front of the altar. You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.(Laughter)(Applause)And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly \u2014 these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs.Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me. They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock. And as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right in behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven. And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer, I might go right on with her.So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait. And the prayers got louder. And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still. And the organ rolled on in to add the dirge. And the heat came on to add to the sweat. And my hand gripped firmer, so I wouldn't be the one left in the field. My eyes clenched tighter so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff. And then a voice rang out above us: \"Amen.\"It was over. I looked at the clock. It was after midnight. I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now. But I was upset on their behalf. They had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, and I had gone right along with them. I had prayed their prayers, I had yielded not to temptation as best I could. I had dipped my head not once, but twice in that snot-inducing baptism pool. I had believed. Now what?I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world. It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones.(Laughter)And this made me feel even more ridiculous \u2014 hurt, really. But there on that night, I did not stop believing. I just believed a new thing: that it was possible not to believe. It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong. And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude, there was, running right down to its foundation, a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers.I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth. And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way, I'm convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come. And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in.I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen. But when I found myself back home one winter break, with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a burglar's gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.(Laughter)So hopeful \u2014(Laughter)that I called home to inform my family that we'd never be poor again.(Laughter)But as I witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer, who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, saying, \"It's been a long time coming, but in this election, change has come to America.\" But as the Congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me.I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power. But over and over again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead.And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die.So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca, Harvard Business School \u2014(Laughter)this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer. No, I knew there'd be more work to do.The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time: \"What if we took a road trip?\"(Laughter)We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to do it. Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to \"sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere,\" and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country. So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin, we went on anyhow.We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line. And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism, this struck us as a revolutionary idea.(Laughter)And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today. It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning. It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help.But if I'm being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it. There was no length to which I would not go to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time. But it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel that I've come to share with you today.It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School. Under a full-size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds. There was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars. We looked over all that we had made, and it was good.(Laughter)But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Harlem, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day. All of them lived below the poverty line. Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter. Some of them came to Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to get the only meal they had each day. Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension, after 20 years as a cab driver. He told me that he didn't give himself a salary, because despite success, the program struggled for resources. He told me that he would take any help that he could get. And I was there as that help.But as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes. I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day.And it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry, it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids, it wasn't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the 99. No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant. I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they didn't have any boots; that my organization stood in for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated.And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium again and again and again. I had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled. But this time, the false savior was me.You see, I've come a long way  from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible truth. Yes, I've come so far that I'm right back where I started.Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief \u2014 no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before. Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Bren\u00e9 Brown or Tony Robbins. We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review. We may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe. We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems. We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god, we take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth. And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one brick, because we fear it might shake our whole foundation.But if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept, then it must be questioning time. So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line. I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact. I have and I offer a gospel of doubt. The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, it asks that you believe a new thing: that it is possible not to believe. It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong. Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong. Because it raises the question, \"Why?\" With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad?This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business. We have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission. This doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.And this doubt, it fuels me, it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelm us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise, when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith \u2014 no, it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shout or to say simply, very simply, \"There must be another way.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2451, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.781 -->

stand,\n\n00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:26.370\nthe deacons and their wives --\n\n00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:28.897\nor the Baptist Bourgeoisie\nas I like to call them --\n\n00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:30.207\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:32.438\ntook first position in front of the altar.\n\n00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.147\nYou see, in America,\n\n00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:37.843\neven the Second Coming of Christ\nhas a VIP section.\n\n00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:40.197\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:42.221\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:47.534\nAnd right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie\n\n00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:49.487\nwere the elderly --\n\n00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:54.399\nthese men and women whose young backs\nhad been bent under hot suns\n\n00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:56.404\nin the cotton fields of East Texas,\n\n00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:00.811\nand whose skin seemed to be burnt\na creaseless noble brown,\n\n00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:02.509\njust like the clay of East Texas,\n\n00:03:03.077 --> 00:03:05.562\nand whose hopes and dreams\nfor what life might become\n\n00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:06.737\noutside of East Texas\n\n00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.404\nhad sometimes been bent and broken\n\n00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:09.927\neven further than their backs.\n\n00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:13.831\nYes, these men and women\nwere the stars of the show for me.\n\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.038\nThey had waited their whole lives\nfor this moment,\n\n00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:21.037\njust as their medieval predecessors\nhad longed for the end of the world,\n\n00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:24.855\nand just as my grandmother\nwaited for the Oprah Winfrey Show\n\n00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.124\nto come on Channel 8\nevery day at 4 o'clock.\n\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.149\nAnd as she made her way to the altar,\n\n00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:32.268\nI snuck right in behind her,\n\n00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:34.266\nbecause I knew for sure\n\n00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.366\nthat my grandmother was going to heaven.\n\n00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:41.389\nAnd I thought that if I held on\nto her hand during this prayer,\n\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.113\nI might go right on with her.\n\n00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.259\nSo I held on\n\n00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.426\nand I closed my eyes\n\n00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.178\nto listen,\n\n00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:51.786\nto wait.\n\n00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:53.796\nAnd the prayers got louder.\n\n00:03:54.386 --> 00:03:56.827\nAnd the shouts of response\nto the call of the prayer\n\n00:03:56.851 --> 00:03:58.254\nwent up higher even still.\n\n00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:01.084\nAnd the organ rolled on in\nto add the dirge.\n\n00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:03.301\nAnd the heat came on to add to the sweat.\n\n00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.934\nAnd my hand gripped firmer,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.971\nso I wouldn't be the one\nleft in the field.\n\n00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:08.194\nMy eyes clenched tighter\n\n00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:11.190\nso I wouldn't see the wheat\nbeing separated from the chaff.\n\n00:04:11.214 --> 00:04:13.583\nAnd then a voice rang out above us:\n\n00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:15.401\n\"Amen.\"\n\n00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:18.586\nIt was over.\n\n00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:21.304\nI looked at the clock.\n\n00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:23.894\nIt was after midnight.\n\n00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.976\nI looked at the elder believers\n\n00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:29.523\nwhose savior had not come,\n\n00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:32.980\nwho were too proud to show\nany signs of disappointment,\n\n00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:35.397\nwho had believed too much and for too long\n\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.543\nto start doubting now.\n\n00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.800\nBut I was upset on their behalf.\n\n00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:44.297\nThey had been duped,\n\n00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.830\nhoodwinked, bamboozled,\n\n00:04:45.854 --> 00:04:47.879\nand I had gone right along with them.\n\n00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:49.988\nI had prayed their prayers,\n\n00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:52.958\nI had yielded not to temptation\nas best I could.\n\n00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:55.402\nI had dipped my head not once, but twice\n\n00:04:56.032 --> 00:04:58.397\nin that snot-inducing baptism pool.\n\n00:04:58.421 --> 00:04:59.684\nI had believed.\n\n00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:02.489\nNow what?\n\n00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:06.779\nI got home just in time\nto turn on the television\n\n00:05:06.803 --> 00:05:09.247\nand watch Peter Jennings\nannounce the new millennium\n\n00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:10.960\nas it rolled in around the world.\n\n00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:15.799\nIt struck me that it would have\nbeen strange anyway,\n\n00:05:15.823 --> 00:05:18.203\nfor Jesus to come back again and again\n\n00:05:18.227 --> 00:05:19.863\nbased on the different time zones.\n\n00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:25.200\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:29.168\nAnd this made me feel\neven more ridiculous --\n\n00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:31.513\nhurt, really.\n\n00:05:33.034 --> 00:05:36.203\nBut there on that night,\nI did not stop believing.\n\n00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:38.739\nI just believed a new thing:\n\n00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:41.877\nthat it was possible not to believe.\n\n00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:45.264\nIt was possible the answers\nI had were wrong,\n\n00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:47.635\nthat the questions themselves were wrong.\n\n00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.221\nAnd now, where there was once\na mountain of certitude,\n\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.541\nthere was, running right down\nto its foundation,\n\n00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:56.679\na spring of doubt,\n\n00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.419\na spring that promised rivers.\n\n00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:03.448\nI can trace the whole drama of my life\n\n00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:05.098\nback to that night in that church\n\n00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:07.204\nwhen my savior did not come for me;\n\n00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:10.549\nwhen the thing I believed most certainly\n\n00:06:11.286 --> 00:06:13.283\nturned out to be, if not a lie,\n\n00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:15.419\nthen not quite the truth.\n\n00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:20.108\nAnd even though most of you\nprepared for Y2K in a very different way,\n\n00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.280\nI'm convinced that you are here\n\n00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:27.212\nbecause some part of you has done\nthe same thing that I have done\n\n00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:29.259\nsince the dawn of this new century,\n\n00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:32.418\nsince my mother left\nand my father stayed away\n\n00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:34.123\nand my Lord refused to come.\n\n00:06:34.825 --> 00:06:36.312\nAnd I held out my hand,\n\n00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:39.288\nreaching for something to believe in.\n\n00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:43.437\nI held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,\n\n00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:46.790\nwith the faith that my journey\nfrom Oak Cliff, Texas\n\n00:06:46.814 --> 00:06:50.503\nwas a chance to leave behind\nall the challenges I had known,\n\n00:06:50.527 --> 00:06:53.358\nthe broken dreams\nand broken bodies I had seen.\n\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.037\nBut when I found myself back home\none winter break,\n\n00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:01.166\nwith my face planted in the floor,\n\n00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:04.561\nmy hands tied behind my back\n\n00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:07.470\nand a burglar's gun pressed to my head,\n\n00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:11.337\nI knew that even the best education\ncouldn't save me.\n\n00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.251\nI held on when I showed up\nat Lehman Brothers\n\n00:07:15.275 --> 00:07:17.289\nas an intern in 2008.\n\n00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:23.673\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:23.697 --> 00:07:25.012\nSo hopeful --\n\n00:07:25.036 --> 00:07:28.298\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.341\nthat I called home to inform my family\n\n00:07:30.365 --> 00:07:31.915\nthat we'd never be poor again.\n\n00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:34.029\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:36.759\nBut as I witnessed this temple of finance\n\n00:07:36.783 --> 00:07:38.598\ncome crashing down before my eyes,\n\n00:07:38.622 --> 00:07:41.898\nI knew that even the best job\ncouldn't save me.\n\n00:07:42.557 --> 00:07:48.410\nI held on when I showed up\nin Washington DC as a young staffer,\n\n00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.659\nwho had heard a voice\ncall out from Illinois,\n\n00:07:50.683 --> 00:07:52.811\nsaying, \"It's been a long time coming,\n\n00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:57.330\nbut in this election, change\nhas come to America.\"\n\n00:07:58.507 --> 00:08:00.249\nBut as the Congress ground to a halt\n\n00:08:00.273 --> 00:08:01.991\nand the country ripped at the seams\n\n00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:04.448\nand hope and change\nbegan to feel like a cruel joke,\n\n00:08:04.472 --> 00:08:07.779\nI knew that even\nthe political second coming\n\n00:08:07.803 --> 00:08:09.026\ncould not save me.\n\n00:08:09.814 --> 00:08:14.274\nI had knelt faithfully at the altar\nof the American Dream,\n\n00:08:14.298 --> 00:08:16.476\npraying to the gods of my time\n\n00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:18.369\nof success,\n\n00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:19.942\nand money,\n\n00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:21.466\nand power.\n\n00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:23.995\nBut over and over again,\n\n00:08:24.577 --> 00:08:27.620\nmidnight struck, and I opened my eyes\n\n00:08:27.644 --> 00:08:30.112\nto see that all of these gods were dead.\n\n00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:32.786\nAnd from that graveyard,\n\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.255\nI began the search once more,\n\n00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.549\nnot because I was brave,\n\n00:08:35.573 --> 00:08:38.978\nbut because I knew\nthat I would either believe\n\n00:08:39.002 --> 00:08:40.229\nor I would die.\n\n00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:43.712\nSo I took a pilgrimage\nto yet another mecca,\n\n00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:45.713\nHarvard Business School --\n\n00:08:45.737 --> 00:08:48.241\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:48.265 --> 00:08:52.150\nthis time, knowing that I could not\nsimply accept the salvation\n\n00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:53.404\nthat it claimed to offer.\n\n00:08:53.428 --> 00:08:56.023\nNo, I knew there'd be more work to do.\n\n00:08:56.939 --> 00:09:01.234\nThe work began in the dark corner\nof a crowded party,\n\n00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:05.510\nin the late night of an early,\nmiserable Cambridge winter,\n\n00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:08.451\nwhen three friends and I asked a question\n\n00:09:08.475 --> 00:09:11.125\nthat young folks searching\nfor something real have asked\n\n00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:12.916\nfor a very long time:\n\n00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.614\n\"What if we took a road trip?\"\n\n00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:17.682\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:20.687\nWe didn't know where'd we go\nor how we'd get there,\n\n00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.472\nbut we knew we had to do it.\n\n00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:26.082\nBecause all our lives we yearned,\nas Jack Kerouac wrote,\n\n00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:30.058\nto \"sneak out into the night\nand disappear somewhere,\"\n\n00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:33.002\nand go find out what everybody was doing\n\n00:09:33.026 --> 00:09:34.298\nall over the country.\n\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.477\nSo even though there were\nother voices who said\n\n00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.954\nthat the risk was too great\nand the proof too thin,\n\n00:09:39.978 --> 00:09:41.334\nwe went on anyhow.\n\n00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:47.584\nWe went on 8,000 miles across America\nin the summer of 2013,\n\n00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:51.756\nthrough the cow pastures of Montana,\nthrough the desolation of Detroit,\n\n00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.403\nthrough the swamps of New Orleans,\n\n00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:56.029\nwhere we found and worked\nwith men and women\n\n00:09:56.053 --> 00:09:57.738\nwho were building small businesses\n\n00:09:57.762 --> 00:10:00.707\nthat made purpose their bottom line.\n\n00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.606\nAnd having been trained\nat the West Point of capitalism,\n\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.734\nthis struck us as a revolutionary idea.\n\n00:10:06.758 --> 00:10:07.774\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:07.798 --> 00:10:09.782\nAnd this idea spread,\n\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.108\ngrowing into a nonprofit\ncalled MBAs Across America,\n\n00:10:14.778 --> 00:10:18.187\na movement that landed me here\non this stage today.\n\n00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:23.755\nIt spread because we found\na great hunger in our generation\n\n00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:26.222\nfor purpose, for meaning.\n\n00:10:27.275 --> 00:10:29.973\nIt spread because we found\ncountless entrepreneurs\n\n00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:31.905\nin the nooks and crannies of America\n\n00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:34.382\nwho were creating jobs and changing lives\n\n00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:35.935\nand who needed a little help.\n\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.326\nBut if I'm being honest, it also spread\n\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.052\nbecause I fought to spread it.\n\n00:10:43.162 --> 00:10:45.405\nThere was no length\nto which I would not go\n\n00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:46.585\nto preach this gospel,\n\n00:10:46.609 --> 00:10:49.445\nto get more people to believe\n\n00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:51.868\nthat we could bind the wounds\nof a broken country,\n\n00:10:51.892 --> 00:10:54.049\none social business at a time.\n\n00:10:55.074 --> 00:10:58.247\nBut it was this journey of evangelism\n\n00:10:59.197 --> 00:11:01.455\nthat led me to the rather different gospel\n\n00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:04.730\nthat I've come to share with you today.\n\n00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:09.037\nIt began one evening almost a year ago\n\n00:11:10.157 --> 00:11:13.351\nat the Museum of Natural History\nin New York City,\n\n00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:17.081\nat a gala for alumni\nof Harvard Business School.\n\n00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:20.834\nUnder a full-size replica of a whale,\n\n00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:23.882\nI sat with the titans of our time\n\n00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:26.627\nas they celebrated their peers\nand their good deeds.\n\n00:11:27.685 --> 00:11:28.969\nThere was pride in a room\n\n00:11:28.993 --> 00:11:31.872\nwhere net worth\nand assets under management\n\n00:11:31.896 --> 00:11:34.275\nsurpassed half a trillion dollars.\n\n00:11:35.154 --> 00:11:37.161\nWe looked over all that we had made,\n\n00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:38.986\nand it was good.\n\n00:11:39.885 --> 00:11:41.872\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:44.254\nBut it just so happened,\n\n00:11:44.917 --> 00:11:46.103\ntwo days later,\n\n00:11:46.568 --> 00:11:48.651\nI had to travel up the road to Harlem,\n\n00:11:49.413 --> 00:11:51.852\nwhere I found myself\nsitting in an urban farm\n\n00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:53.661\nthat had once been a vacant lot,\n\n00:11:54.374 --> 00:11:57.274\nlistening to a man named Tony\ntell me of the kids\n\n00:11:57.298 --> 00:11:58.856\nthat showed up there every day.\n\n00:11:59.902 --> 00:12:03.225\nAll of them lived below the poverty line.\n\n00:12:04.033 --> 00:12:07.453\nMany of them carried\nall of their belongings in a backpack\n\n00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.662\nto avoid losing them\nin a homeless shelter.\n\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.638\nSome of them came to Tony's program,\n\n00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:15.009\ncalled Harlem Grown,\n\n00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.982\nto get the only meal they had each day.\n\n00:12:19.423 --> 00:12:24.038\nTony told me that he started Harlem Grown\nwith money from his pension,\n\n00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:27.165\nafter 20 years as a cab driver.\n\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.509\nHe told me that he didn't give\nhimself a salary,\n\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.142\nbecause despite success,\nthe program struggled for resources.\n\n00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.058\nHe told me that he would take any help\n\n00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:39.780\nthat he could get.\n\n00:12:40.448 --> 00:12:43.094\nAnd I was there as that help.\n\n00:12:44.821 --> 00:12:49.116\nBut as I left Tony,\nI felt the sting and salt of tears\n\n00:12:49.796 --> 00:12:51.333\nwelling up in my eyes.\n\n00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:54.432\nI felt the weight of revelation\n\n00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:58.277\nthat I could sit in one room on one night,\n\n00:12:59.164 --> 00:13:03.266\nwhere a few hundred people\nhad half a trillion dollars,\n\n00:13:04.145 --> 00:13:06.206\nand another room, two days later,\n\n00:13:06.778 --> 00:13:09.075\njust 50 blocks up the road,\n\n00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:12.173\nwhere a man was going without a salary\n\n00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:15.749\nto get a child her only meal of the day.\n\n00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:20.375\nAnd it wasn't the glaring inequality\nthat made me want to cry,\n\n00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:23.210\nit wasn't the thought of hungry,\nhomeless kids,\n\n00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:25.070\nit wasn't rage toward the one percent\n\n00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:27.372\nor pity toward the 99.\n\n00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:31.530\nNo, I was disturbed\nbecause I had finally realized\n\n00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:34.557\nthat I was the dialysis\n\n00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.778\nfor a country that needed\na kidney transplant.\n\n00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:42.274\nI realized that my story\nstood in for all those\n\n00:13:42.298 --> 00:13:45.140\nwho were expected to pick\nthemselves up by their bootstraps,\n\n00:13:45.164 --> 00:13:47.310\neven if they didn't have any boots;\n\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.813\nthat my organization stood in\n\n00:13:49.837 --> 00:13:53.587\nfor all the structural, systemic help\nthat never went to Harlem\n\n00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:55.556\nor Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;\n\n00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.359\nthat my voice stood in\nfor all those voices\n\n00:14:01.056 --> 00:14:06.199\nthat seemed too unlearned,\ntoo unwashed, too unaccommodated.\n\n00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:08.496\nAnd the shame of that,\n\n00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:11.066\nthat shame washed over me\n\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.951\nlike the shame of sitting\nin front of the television,\n\n00:14:14.856 --> 00:14:17.355\nwatching Peter Jennings\nannounce the new millennium\n\n00:14:17.379 --> 00:14:18.587\nagain\n\n00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:19.761\nand again\n\n00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:21.365\nand again.\n\n00:14:21.754 --> 00:14:22.904\nI had been duped,\n\n00:14:24.042 --> 00:14:25.192\nhoodwinked,\n\n00:14:25.654 --> 00:14:26.804\nbamboozled.\n\n00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:30.435\nBut this time, the false savior was me.\n\n00:14:31.558 --> 00:14:35.260\nYou see, I've come a long way \nfrom that altar\n\n00:14:35.284 --> 00:14:37.380\non the night I thought\nthe world would end,\n\n00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:40.534\nfrom a world where people spoke in tongues\n\n00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:43.703\nand saw suffering\nas a necessary act of God\n\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.248\nand took a text to be infallible truth.\n\n00:14:46.272 --> 00:14:47.797\nYes, I've come so far\n\n00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:51.101\nthat I'm right back where I started.\n\n00:14:52.061 --> 00:14:54.276\nBecause it simply is not true to say\n\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.181\nthat we live in an age of disbelief --\n\n00:14:56.205 --> 00:15:00.521\nno, we believe today just as much\nas any time that came before.\n\n00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:04.210\nSome of us may believe\nin the prophecy of Bren\u00e9 Brown\n\n00:15:04.234 --> 00:15:05.410\nor Tony Robbins.\n\n00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.061\nWe may believe in the bible\nof The New Yorker\n\n00:15:08.085 --> 00:15:09.695\nor the Harvard Business Review.\n\n00:15:10.104 --> 00:15:11.683\nWe may believe most deeply\n\n00:15:12.108 --> 00:15:14.710\nwhen we worship right here\nat the church of TED,\n\n00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:17.486\nbut we desperately want to believe,\n\n00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.056\nwe need to believe.\n\n00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:22.144\nWe speak in the tongues\nof charismatic leaders\n\n00:15:22.168 --> 00:15:24.360\nthat promise to solve all our problems.\n\n00:15:24.384 --> 00:15:28.464\nWe see suffering as a necessary act\nof the capitalism that is our god,\n\n00:15:28.488 --> 00:15:30.720\nwe take the text of technological progress\n\n00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:33.191\nto be infallible truth.\n\n00:15:33.992 --> 00:15:37.608\nAnd we hardly realize\nthe human price we pay\n\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.720\nwhen we fail to question one brick,\n\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.599\nbecause we fear it might shake\nour whole foundation.\n\n00:15:45.635 --> 00:15:47.236\nBut if you are disturbed\n\n00:15:48.038 --> 00:15:51.168\nby the unconscionable things\nthat we have come to accept,\n\n00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:54.641\nthen it must be questioning time.\n\n00:15:55.945 --> 00:15:59.992\nSo I have not a gospel\nof disruption or innovation\n\n00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:01.466\nor a triple bottom line.\n\n00:16:02.338 --> 00:16:05.943\nI do not have a gospel of faith\nto share with you today, in fact.\n\n00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:10.925\nI have and I offer a gospel of doubt.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.978\nThe gospel of doubt does not ask\nthat you stop believing,\n\n00:16:15.695 --> 00:16:17.615\nit asks that you believe a new thing:\n\n00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:20.695\nthat it is possible not to believe.\n\n00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.640\nIt is possible the answers\nwe have are wrong,\n\n00:16:23.664 --> 00:16:26.247\nit is possible the questions\nthemselves are wrong.\n\n00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:30.093\nYes, the gospel of doubt means\nthat it is possible that we,\n\n00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:32.703\non this stage, in this room,\n\n00:16:33.136 --> 00:16:34.293\nare wrong.\n\n00:16:34.737 --> 00:16:37.002\nBecause it raises the question, \"Why?\"\n\n00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.922\nWith all the power\nthat we hold in our hands,\n\n00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:44.326\nwhy are people still suffering so bad?\n\n00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:49.722\nThis doubt leads me to share\nthat we are putting my organization,\n\n00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:51.012\nMBAs Across America,\n\n00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:52.664\nout of business.\n\n00:16:52.688 --> 00:16:55.180\nWe have shed our staff\nand closed our doors\n\n00:16:55.204 --> 00:16:57.232\nand we will share our model freely\n\n00:16:57.256 --> 00:17:00.142\nwith anyone who sees\ntheir power to do this work\n\n00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:02.014\nwithout waiting for our permission.\n\n00:17:02.392 --> 00:17:04.713\nThis doubt compels me\n\n00:17:05.194 --> 00:17:06.967\nto renounce the role of savior\n\n00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:08.386\nthat some have placed on me,\n\n00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.954\nbecause our time is too short\nand our odds are too long\n\n00:17:11.978 --> 00:17:13.758\nto wait for second comings,\n\n00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:17.266\nwhen the truth is that\nthere will be no miracles here.\n\n00:17:18.263 --> 00:17:20.007\nAnd this doubt, it fuels me,\n\n00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:21.986\nit gives me hope\n\n00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:24.814\nthat when our troubles overwhelm us,\n\n00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:29.837\nwhen the paths laid out for us\nseem to lead to our demise,\n\n00:17:30.486 --> 00:17:33.514\nwhen our healers bring\nno comfort to our wounds,\n\n00:17:34.244 --> 00:17:36.575\nit will not be our blind faith --\n\n00:17:37.381 --> 00:17:39.768\nno, it will be our humble doubt\n\n00:17:40.688 --> 00:17:43.999\nthat shines a little light\ninto the darkness of our lives\n\n00:17:44.023 --> 00:17:45.256\nand of our world\n\n00:17:45.828 --> 00:17:47.997\nand lets us raise our voice to whisper\n\n00:17:48.791 --> 00:17:49.941\nor to shout\n\n00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:52.110\nor to say simply,\n\n00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:53.284\nvery simply,\n\n00:17:53.664 --> 00:17:56.180\n\"There must be another way.\"\n\n00:17:56.969 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/joe_gebbia_how_airbnb_designs_for_trust", "transcript": "I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata. It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale. And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff. And he buys a piece of art that I made. And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps. So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world.Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired. As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, \"So where are you staying tonight?\" And he makes it worse by saying, \"Actually, I don't have a place.\" And I'm thinking, \"Oh, man!\" What do you do? We've all been there, right? Do I offer to host this guy? But, I just met him \u2014 I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata. That's a small trunk!So then I hear myself saying, \"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room.\" And the voice in my head goes, \"Wait, what?\"That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, \"Oh my god, what have I done? There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room. What if he's psychotic?\" My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door.It turns out he was not psychotic. We've kept in touch ever since. And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective. Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered. The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.So now it's two years later. I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up. And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out. And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity.So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: \"Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks \u2014 turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning. Ha!\"We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born. Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor. But they loved it, and so did we. I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests. We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other. Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent?The wheels had started to turn. My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder. And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business.Here's what we pitched investors: \"We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms \u2014 the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over. And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes. It's going to be huge!\"(Laughter)We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off. It did not. No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes. Why? Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design. In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something \u2014 it's the whole experience. We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met. Could design make that happen? Is it possible to design for trust?I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve. I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone. If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up. OK, I need you to take out your phones. Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone. Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.(Laughter)That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now \u2014(Laughter)is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home. Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home. People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone? Most of us feel really responsible. That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home. And it's because of this that our company can even exist. By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?(Laughter)Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?(Laughter)(Applause)OK, you can hand your phones back now.So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way. What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment? What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog? Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, \"They're great at holding unlocked phones!\"(Laughter)Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust. And we didn't actually get it right the first time. It's hard for people to leave bad reviews. Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them.Now, here's a discovery we made just last week. We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography. The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us. The more different somebody is, the less we trust them. Now, that's a natural social bias. But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews.Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes. But if you've got more than 10, everything changes. High reputation beats high similarity. The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases.Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure. This is what happens when a guest first messages a host. If you share too little, like, \"Yo,\" acceptance rates go down. And if you share too much, like, \"I'm having issues with my mother,\"(Laughter)acceptance rates also go down. But there's a zone that's just right, like, \"Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family.\" So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure? We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias. What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption. There's three things happening here. The first, an unbelievable amount of luck. The second is the efforts of our team. And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need. Now, things have been going pretty well.Obviously, there are times when things don't work out. Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes. Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain. In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone. I was at the front lines of trust breaking. And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them. And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving.Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic. Turns out, people are justified in their trust. And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical.We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack. The host rushed him to the hospital. They donated their own blood for his operation. Let me read you his review.(Laughter)\"Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions.(Laughter)The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.(Laughter)Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you. They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass. They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read. And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you. Highly recommended!\"(Applause)Of course, not every stay is like that. But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up. How do sharing and transactions go together? So let's be clear; it is about commerce. But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete. The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection. People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything.You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food \u2014 it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic. What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences? What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed. Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation. What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up? What would that look like? What if cities embraced a culture of sharing? I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation.In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this. They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents. They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms. And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups.Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs. Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.We didn't invent anything new. Hospitality has been around forever. There's been many other websites like ours. So, why did ours eventually take off? Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that. Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias. And that's amazing to me. It blows my mind. I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems. But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2447, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.295\nI want to tell you the story\n\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.077\nabout the time I almost got kidnapped\n\n00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:21.077\nin the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.\n\n00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.063\nIt's the day after graduating\nfrom design school\n\n00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:26.572\nand I'm having a yard sale.\n\n00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:29.289\nAnd this guy pulls up in this red Mazda\n\n00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:31.426\nand he starts looking through my stuff.\n\n00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.876\nAnd he buys a piece of art that I made.\n\n00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:38.043\nAnd it turns out he's alone\nin town for the night,\n\n00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.620\ndriving cross-country on a road trip\n\n00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:42.427\nbefore he goes into the Peace Corps.\n\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.454\nSo I invite him out for a beer\n\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.581\nand he tells me all about his passion\n\n00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:49.653\nfor making a difference in the world.\n\n00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:52.044\nNow it's starting to get late,\n\n00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:54.025\nand I'm getting pretty tired.\n\n00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:56.362\nAs I motion for the tab,\n\n00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:58.533\nI make the mistake of asking him,\n\n00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:01.239\n\"So where are you staying tonight?\"\n\n00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:04.072\nAnd he makes it worse by saying,\n\n00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.676\n\"Actually, I don't have a place.\"\n\n00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.940\nAnd I'm thinking, \"Oh, man!\"\n\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.170\nWhat do you do?\n\n00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:14.242\nWe've all been there, right?\n\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.806\nDo I offer to host this guy?\n\n00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:19.441\nBut, I just met him -- I mean,\n\n00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:21.291\nhe says he's going to the Peace Corps,\n\n00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.950\nbut I don't really know if he's going\nto the Peace Corps\n\n00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:26.854\nand I don't want to end up kidnapped\nin the trunk of a Miata.\n\n00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.052\nThat's a small trunk!\n\n00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.113\nSo then I hear myself saying,\n\n00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:35.161\n\"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on\nin my living room.\"\n\n00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:37.505\nAnd the voice in my head goes,\n\n00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:38.847\n\"Wait, what?\"\n\n00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:42.473\nThat night, I'm laying in bed,\n\n00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:44.704\nI'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,\n\n00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:48.435\n\"Oh my god, what have I done?\n\n00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.614\nThere's a complete stranger\nsleeping in my living room.\n\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.273\nWhat if he's psychotic?\"\n\n00:01:54.987 --> 00:01:56.287\nMy anxiety grows so much,\n\n00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.171\nI leap out of bed,\n\n00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:00.888\nI sneak on my tiptoes to the door,\n\n00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.737\nand I lock the bedroom door.\n\n00:02:04.232 --> 00:02:06.126\nIt turns out he was not psychotic.\n\n00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.381\nWe've kept in touch ever since.\n\n00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.695\nAnd the piece of art\nhe bought at the yard sale\n\n00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.208\nis hanging in his classroom;\nhe's a teacher now.\n\n00:02:14.983 --> 00:02:16.770\nThis was my first hosting experience,\n\n00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:19.678\nand it completely changed my perspective.\n\n00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:25.918\nMaybe the people that my childhood\ntaught me to label as strangers\n\n00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:28.398\nwere actually friends waiting\nto be discovered.\n\n00:02:29.564 --> 00:02:33.445\nThe idea of hosting people on airbeds\ngradually became natural to me\n\n00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.128\nand when I moved to San Francisco,\n\n00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:36.747\nI brought the airbed with me.\n\n00:02:37.143 --> 00:02:38.700\nSo now it's two years later.\n\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.009\nI'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,\n\n00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:45.307\nmy roommate moves out,\nand then the rent goes up.\n\n00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:49.009\nAnd then I learn there's a design\nconference coming to town,\n\n00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.824\nand all the hotels are sold out.\n\n00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.328\nAnd I've always believed\nthat turning fear into fun\n\n00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.860\nis the gift of creativity.\n\n00:02:56.707 --> 00:03:02.018\nSo here's what I pitch my best friend\nand my new roommate Brian Chesky:\n\n00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:04.342\n\"Brian, thought of a way\nto make a few bucks --\n\n00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:06.849\nturning our place into 'designers\nbed and breakfast,'\n\n00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:09.652\noffering young designers who come\nto town a place to crash,\n\n00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:12.123\ncomplete with wireless Internet,\na small desk space,\n\n00:03:12.147 --> 00:03:14.163\nsleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.\n\n00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:15.358\nHa!\"\n\n00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:20.032\nWe built a basic website\nand Airbed and Breakfast was born.\n\n00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:22.903\nThree lucky guests got to stay\n\n00:03:22.927 --> 00:03:25.498\non a 20-dollar airbed\non the hardwood floor.\n\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.482\nBut they loved it, and so did we.\n\n00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:31.364\nI swear, the ham\nand Swiss cheese omelets we made\n\n00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:34.395\ntasted totally different\nbecause we made them for our guests.\n\n00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:37.758\nWe took them on adventures\naround the city,\n\n00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:40.394\nand when we said goodbye\nto the last guest,\n\n00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:41.901\nthe door latch clicked,\n\n00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:44.885\nBrian and I just stared at each other.\n\n00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.228\nDid we just discover\nit was possible to make friends\n\n00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:50.830\nwhile also making rent?\n\n00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:53.957\nThe wheels had started to turn.\n\n00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:55.632\nMy old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,\n\n00:03:55.656 --> 00:03:57.973\njoined as engineering co-founder.\n\n00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:00.577\nAnd we buckled down to see\n\n00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:02.504\nif we could turn this into a business.\n\n00:04:03.914 --> 00:04:05.644\nHere's what we pitched investors:\n\n00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:09.772\n\"We want to build a website\n\n00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:13.338\nwhere people publicly post pictures\nof their most intimate spaces,\n\n00:04:13.362 --> 00:04:15.219\ntheir bedrooms, the bathrooms --\n\n00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:18.669\nthe kinds of rooms you usually keep closed\nwhen people come over.\n\n00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:20.364\nAnd then, over the Internet,\n\n00:04:20.388 --> 00:04:23.821\nthey're going to invite complete strangers\nto come sleep in their homes.\n\n00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:25.250\nIt's going to be huge!\"\n\n00:04:25.274 --> 00:04:27.440\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.464 --> 00:04:30.721\nWe sat back, and we waited\nfor the rocket ship to blast off.\n\n00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:33.056\nIt did not.\n\n00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:37.464\nNo one in their right minds\nwould invest in a service\n\n00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:40.060\nthat allows strangers\nto sleep in people's homes.\n\n00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:41.236\nWhy?\n\n00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:45.178\nBecause we've all been taught\nas kids, strangers equal danger.\n\n00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:49.543\nNow, when you're faced with a problem,\nyou fall back on what you know,\n\n00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:51.337\nand all we really knew was design.\n\n00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.170\nIn art school, you learn\nthat design is much more\n\n00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:58.407\nthan the look and feel of something --\nit's the whole experience.\n\n00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.490\nWe learned to do that for objects,\n\n00:05:00.514 --> 00:05:04.798\nbut here, we were aiming\nto build Olympic trust\n\n00:05:04.822 --> 00:05:06.632\nbetween people who had never met.\n\n00:05:08.462 --> 00:05:10.200\nCould design make that happen?\n\n00:05:11.308 --> 00:05:13.655\nIs it possible to design for trust?\n\n00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.760\nI want to give you a sense\nof the flavor of trust\n\n00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.640\nthat we were aiming to achieve.\n\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.080\nI've got a 30-second experiment\n\n00:05:23.104 --> 00:05:25.552\nthat will push you past your comfort zone.\n\n00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:27.837\nIf you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.\n\n00:05:30.387 --> 00:05:33.612\nOK, I need you to take out your phones.\n\n00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:40.324\nNow that you have your phone out,\n\n00:05:40.348 --> 00:05:42.077\nI'd like you to unlock your phone.\n\n00:05:45.765 --> 00:05:49.582\nNow hand your unlocked phone\nto the person on your left.\n\n00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:53.311\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:01.692 --> 00:06:04.505\nThat tiny sense of panic\nyou're feeling right now --\n\n00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.204\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:09.558\nis exactly how hosts feel the first time\nthey open their home.\n\n00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.296\nBecause the only thing\nmore personal than your phone\n\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.519\nis your home.\n\n00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.848\nPeople don't just see your messages,\n\n00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:18.131\nthey see your bedroom,\n\n00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:19.745\nyour kitchen, your toilet.\n\n00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:25.439\nNow, how does it feel holding\nsomeone's unlocked phone?\n\n00:06:26.143 --> 00:06:27.891\nMost of us feel really responsible.\n\n00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:32.776\nThat's how most guests feel\nwhen they stay in a home.\n\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.743\nAnd it's because of this\nthat our company can even exist.\n\n00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:39.052\nBy the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?\n\n00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:42.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:45.155\nWould you tell Twitter\nhe's running for President?\n\n00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:47.180\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:47.204 --> 00:06:49.742\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:57.935\nOK, you can hand your phones back now.\n\n00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.798\nSo now that you've experienced\nthe kind of trust challenge\n\n00:07:06.822 --> 00:07:08.062\nwe were facing,\n\n00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:11.215\nI'd love to share a few discoveries\nwe've made along the way.\n\n00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.228\nWhat if we changed one small thing\n\n00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:16.296\nabout the design of that experiment?\n\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.103\nWhat if your neighbor had introduced\nthemselves first, with their name,\n\n00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:22.992\nwhere they're from, the name\nof their kids or their dog?\n\n00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:27.175\nImagine that they had 150 reviews\nof people saying,\n\n00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.604\n\"They're great at holding\nunlocked phones!\"\n\n00:07:29.628 --> 00:07:31.485\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:37.864\nNow how would you feel\nabout handing your phone over?\n\n00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:40.894\nIt turns out,\n\n00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:44.370\na well-designed reputation system\nis key for building trust.\n\n00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:47.919\nAnd we didn't actually\nget it right the first time.\n\n00:07:47.943 --> 00:07:50.688\nIt's hard for people to leave bad reviews.\n\n00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:55.791\nEventually, we learned to wait\nuntil both guests and hosts\n\n00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:57.919\nleft the review before we reveal them.\n\n00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:02.157\nNow, here's a discovery\nwe made just last week.\n\n00:08:02.942 --> 00:08:04.846\nWe did a joint study with Stanford,\n\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.864\nwhere we looked at people's\nwillingness to trust someone\n\n00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:12.354\nbased on how similar they are in age,\nlocation and geography.\n\n00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:16.385\nThe research showed, not surprisingly,\n\n00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:18.353\nwe prefer people who are like us.\n\n00:08:20.052 --> 00:08:22.887\nThe more different somebody is,\n\n00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:24.238\nthe less we trust them.\n\n00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.111\nNow, that's a natural social bias.\n\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.844\nBut what's interesting is what happens\n\n00:08:30.868 --> 00:08:32.826\nwhen you add reputation into the mix,\n\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.690\nin this case, with reviews.\n\n00:08:35.356 --> 00:08:37.373\nNow, if you've got\nless than three reviews,\n\n00:08:37.397 --> 00:08:38.777\nnothing changes.\n\n00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:41.604\nBut if you've got more than 10,\n\n00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:44.401\neverything changes.\n\n00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:48.653\nHigh reputation beats high similarity.\n\n00:08:50.257 --> 00:08:52.987\nThe right design can actually\nhelp us overcome\n\n00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:55.193\none of our most deeply rooted biases.\n\n00:08:57.205 --> 00:09:00.313\nNow we also learned that building\nthe right amount of trust\n\n00:09:00.337 --> 00:09:02.590\ntakes the right amount of disclosure.\n\n00:09:03.233 --> 00:09:06.495\nThis is what happens when a guest\nfirst messages a host.\n\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.710\nIf you share too little, like, \"Yo,\"\n\n00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:14.441\nacceptance rates go down.\n\n00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:16.582\nAnd if you share too much, like,\n\n00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:18.299\n\"I'm having issues with my mother,\"\n\n00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:19.473\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:19.497 --> 00:09:21.489\nacceptance rates also go down.\n\n00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.275\nBut there's a zone that's just right,\n\n00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:28.597\nlike, \"Love the artwork in your place.\nComing for vacation with my family.\"\n\n00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:31.930\nSo how do we design for just\nthe right amount of disclosure?\n\n00:09:33.128 --> 00:09:36.073\nWe use the size of the box\nto suggest the right length,\n\n00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:39.335\nand we guide them with prompts\nto encourage sharing.\n\n00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:43.214\nWe bet our whole company\n\n00:09:44.103 --> 00:09:45.747\non the hope that,\n\n00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:47.654\nwith the right design,\n\n00:09:47.678 --> 00:09:50.947\npeople would be willing to overcome\nthe stranger-danger bias.\n\n00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:53.258\nWhat we didn't realize\n\n00:09:53.282 --> 00:09:55.716\nis just how many people\n\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.115\nwere ready and waiting\nto put the bias aside.\n\n00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.532\nThis is a graph that shows\nour rate of adoption.\n\n00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:05.413\nThere's three things happening here.\n\n00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:09.754\nThe first, an unbelievable amount of luck.\n\n00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:12.919\nThe second is the efforts of our team.\n\n00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:17.540\nAnd third is the existence\nof a previously unsatisfied need.\n\n00:10:19.057 --> 00:10:21.434\nNow, things have been going pretty well.\n\n00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:24.250\nObviously, there are times\nwhen things don't work out.\n\n00:10:25.605 --> 00:10:27.569\nGuests have thrown unauthorized parties\n\n00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:28.862\nand trashed homes.\n\n00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:32.742\nHosts have left guests\nstranded in the

was at the front lines\nof trust breaking.\n\n00:10:45.454 --> 00:10:48.002\nAnd there's nothing worse\nthan those calls,\n\n00:10:48.026 --> 00:10:50.255\nit hurts to even think about them.\n\n00:10:51.071 --> 00:10:53.764\nAnd the disappointment\nin the sound of someone's voice\n\n00:10:53.788 --> 00:10:56.527\nwas and, I would say, still is\n\n00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:58.991\nour

together?\n\n00:12:44.017 --> 00:12:46.918\nSo let's be clear; it is about commerce.\n\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.114\nBut if you just called it\nthe rental economy,\n\n00:12:50.138 -->

themselves,\n\n00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:02.116\nand that changes everything.\n\n00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:05.811\nYou know how most travel today is, like,\n\n00:13:05.835 --> 00:13:07.566\nI think of it

was a central marketplace of locals\n\n00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:27.261\noffering to get you thoroughly drunk\n\n00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:31.210\non a pub crawl in neighborhoods\nyou didn't even know

procrastinator", "duration": "843", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator", "transcript": "So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know \u2014(Laughter)you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil.(Laughter)And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this.(Laughter)And that would happen every single paper.But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right?But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan.(Laughter)And then \u2014(Laughter)But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters \u2014 humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters \u2014 sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline.I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, \"Is this Tim Urban?\" And I say, \"Yeah.\" And they say, \"We need to talk about your thesis.\" And I say, \"OK.\" And they say, \"It's the best one we've ever seen.\"(Laughter)(Applause)That did not happen.(Laughter)It was a very, very bad thesis.(Laughter)I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, \"This guy is amazing!\"(Laughter)No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.(Laughter)Now ... here's my brain.(Laughter)There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, \"Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened.(Laughter)Then \u2014(Laughter)Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.(Laughter)\"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!\"(Sigh)Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun.Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success!(Laughter)And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground.(Laughter)Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred \u2014 all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments \u2014 someone called the Panic Monster.(Laughter)Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk.(Laughter)Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.(Laughter)(Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind. He was saying, \"Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now.\" And the Monkey said, \"Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India.\"(Laughter)So that's what we did that day.(Laughter)As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up?(Laughter)So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.(Laughter)And the Monkey \u2014 remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster \u2014 boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk.Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters \u2014 this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students.(Laughter)And they were all writing, saying the same thing: \"I have this problem too.\" But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place?Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter \u2014 something in the arts, something entrepreneurial \u2014 there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany \u2014 that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right \u2014 I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us,(Laughter)and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there.Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today.Well, maybe not today, but ...(Laughter)You know. Sometime soon.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2458, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:13.973\nSo in college,\n\n00:00:15.307 -->

paper,\n\n00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:23.826\nthey might spread the work out\na little like this.\n\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.001\nSo, you know --\n\n00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.682\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:28.533\nyou get started maybe a little slowly,\n\n00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:30.525\nbut you get enough done in the first week\n\n00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:32.380\nthat, with some heavier days later on,\n\n00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:34.561\neverything gets done, things stay civil.\n\n00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:35.787\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:38.082\nAnd I would want to do that like that.\n\n00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:39.300\nThat would be the plan.\n\n00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:41.814\nI would have it all ready to go,\n\n00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:44.332\nbut then, actually, the paper\nwould come along,\n\n00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:46.297\nand then I would kind of do this.\n\n00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:48.691\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.858\nAnd that would happen every single paper.\n\n00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:55.478\nBut then came my 90-page senior thesis,\n\n00:00:55.502 --> 00:00:57.789\na paper you're supposed\nto spend a year on.\n\n00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:01.432\nAnd I knew for a paper like that,\nmy normal work flow was not an option.\n\n00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:02.857\nIt was way too big a project.\n\n00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:04.034\nSo I planned things out,\n\n00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:07.263\nand I decided I kind of had\nto go something like this.\n\n00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.191\nThis is how the year would go.\n\n00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:11.182\nSo I'd start off light,\n\n00:01:11.206 --> 00:01:13.524\nand I'd bump it up in the middle months,\n\n00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:16.174\nand then at the end,\nI would kick it up into high gear\n\n00:01:16.198 --> 00:01:17.637\njust like a little staircase.\n\n00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.723\nHow hard could it be\nto walk up the stairs?\n\n00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.510\nNo big deal, right?\n\n00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:24.858\nBut then, the funniest thing happened.\n\n00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:26.193\nThose first few months?\n\n00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:27.916\nThey came and went,\n\n00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.525\nand I couldn't quite do stuff.\n\n00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.398\nSo we had an awesome new revised plan.\n\n00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:32.589\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:33.772\nAnd then --\n\n00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:35.678\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:35.702 --> 00:01:38.486\nBut then those middle months\nactually went by,\n\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.692\nand I didn't really write words,\n\n00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:42.551\nand so we were here.\n\n00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:46.034\nAnd then two months turned into one month,\n\n00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:47.683\nwhich turned into two weeks.\n\n00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.016\nAnd one day I woke up\n\n00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:52.301\nwith three days until the deadline,\n\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.391\nstill not having written a word,\n\n00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.474\nand so I did the only thing I could:\n\n00:01:57.498 --> 00:02:00.105\nI wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,\n\n00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:02.405\npulling not one but two all-nighters --\n\n00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.998\nhumans are not supposed to pull\ntwo all-nighters --\n\n00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:08.324\nsprinted across campus,\n\n00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:09.834\ndove in slow motion,\n\n00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:11.914\nand got it in just at the deadline.\n\n00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:13.962\nI thought that was the end of everything.\n\n00:02:13.986 --> 00:02:15.545\nBut a week later I get a call,\n\n00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.055\nand it's the school.\n\n00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:19.354\nAnd they say, \"Is this Tim Urban?\"\n\n00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:20.846\nAnd I say, \"Yeah.\"\n\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.210\nAnd they say, \"We need\nto talk about your thesis.\"\n\n00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:24.489\nAnd I say, \"OK.\"\n\n00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:26.648\nAnd they say,\n\n00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.084\n\"It's the best one we've ever seen.\"\n\n00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:30.813\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:34.662\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:38.205\nThat did not happen.\n\n00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.367\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:43.014\nIt was a very, very bad thesis.\n\n00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.312\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:49.436\nI just wanted to enjoy that one moment\nwhen all of you thought,\n\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.365\n\"This guy is amazing!\"\n\n00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.737\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:54.428\nNo, no, it was very, very bad.\n\n00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:58.709\nAnyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.\n\n00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.476\nI write the blog Wait But Why.\n\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.236\nAnd a couple of years ago,\nI decided to write about procrastination.\n\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.544\nMy behavior has always perplexed\nthe non-procrastinators around me,\n\n00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:11.256\nand I wanted to explain\nto the non-procrastinators of the world\n\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.387\nwhat goes on in the heads\nof procrastinators,\n\n00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:14.851\nand why we are the way we are.\n\n00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:16.031\nNow, I had a hypothesis\n\n00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:18.910\nthat the brains of procrastinators\nwere actually different\n\n00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:20.891\nthan the brains of other people.\n\n00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:23.847\nAnd to test this, I found an MRI lab\n\n00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.303\nthat actually let me scan both my brain\n\n00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:28.982\nand the brain of a proven\nnon-procrastinator,\n\n00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:30.441\nso I could compare them.\n\n00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.666\nI actually brought them here\nto show you today.\n\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.227\nI want you to take a look carefully\nto see if you can notice a difference.\n\n00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.565\nI know that if you're not\na trained brain expert,\n\n00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:40.852\nit's not that obvious,\nbut just take a look, OK?\n\n00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:43.004\nSo here's the brain\nof a non-procrastinator.\n\n00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:46.067\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.242\nNow ...\n\n00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:49.597\nhere's my brain.\n\n00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:52.964\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:57.235\nThere is a difference.\n\n00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.250\nBoth brains have a Rational\nDecision-Maker in them,\n\n00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:01.926\nbut the procrastinator's brain\n\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.936\nalso has an Instant Gratification Monkey.\n\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.262\nNow, what does this mean\nfor the procrastinator?\n\n00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:09.727\nWell, it means everything's fine\nuntil this happens.\n\n00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:12.373\n[This is a perfect time\nto get some work done.] [Nope!]\n\n00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:15.330\nSo the Rational Decision-Maker\nwill make the rational decision\n\n00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:17.250\nto do something productive,\n\n00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:19.224\nbut the Monkey doesn't like that plan,\n\n00:04:19.248 --> 00:04:20.756\nso he actually takes the wheel,\n\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.661\nand he says, \"Actually, let's read\nthe entire Wikipedia page\n\n00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:25.821\nof the Nancy Kerrigan/\nTonya Harding scandal,\n\n00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:27.976\nbecause I just remembered\nthat that happened.\n\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.016\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.198\nThen --\n\n00:04:30.222 --> 00:04:31.485\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.547\nThen we're going to go over to the fridge,\n\n00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:36.437\nto see if there's anything new\nin there since 10 minutes ago.\n\n00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:39.099\nAfter that, we're going to go\non a YouTube spiral\n\n00:04:39.123 --> 00:04:42.373\nthat starts with videos\nof Richard Feynman talking about magnets\n\n00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:45.113\nand ends much, much later\nwith us watching interviews\n\n00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:47.017\nwith Justin Bieber's mom.\n\n00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.229\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:51.016\n\"All of that's going to take a while,\n\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.542\nso we're not going to really have room\non the schedule for any work today.\n\n00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:55.729\nSorry!\"\n\n00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:56.918\n(Sigh)\n\n00:04:58.283 --> 00:05:01.652\nNow, what is going on here?\n\n00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.130\nThe Instant Gratification Monkey\ndoes not seem like a guy\n\n00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:07.408\nyou want behind the wheel.\n\n00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.377\nHe lives entirely in the present moment.\n\n00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:12.229\nHe has no memory of the past,\nno knowledge of the future,\n\n00:05:12.253 --> 00:05:13.950\nand he only cares about two things:\n\n00:05:13.974 --> 00:05:15.657\neasy and fun.\n\n00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:19.388\nNow, in the animal world, that works fine.\n\n00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:20.620\nIf you're a dog\n\n00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:24.215\nand you spend your whole life doing\nnothing other than easy and fun things,\n\n00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:25.404\nyou're a huge success!\n\n00:05:25.428 --> 00:05:27.339\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:27.363 --> 00:05:28.649\nAnd to the Monkey,\n\n00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:32.021\nhumans are just another animal species.\n\n00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:36.551\nYou have to keep well-slept, well-fed\nand propagating into the next generation,\n\n00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:38.861\nwhich in tribal times\nmight have worked OK.\n\n00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:41.735\nBut, if you haven't noticed,\nnow we're not in tribal times.\n\n00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.892\nWe're in an advanced civilization,\nand the Monkey does not know what that is.\n\n00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:48.197\nWhich is why we have\nanother guy in our brain,\n\n00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:50.586\nthe Rational Decision-Maker,\n\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.637\nwho gives us the ability to do things\nno other animal can do.\n\n00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:55.582\nWe can visualize the future.\n\n00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.358\nWe can see the big picture.\n\n00:05:57.382 --> 00:05:58.732\nWe can make long-term plans.\n\n00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:01.239\nAnd he wants to take\nall of that into account.\n\n00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:03.787\nAnd he wants to just have us do\n\n00:06:03.811 --> 00:06:06.759\nwhatever makes sense\nto be doing right now.\n\n00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.172\nNow, sometimes it makes sense\n\n00:06:08.196 --> 00:06:10.225\nto be doing things that are easy and fun,\n\n00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.400\nlike when you're having dinner\nor going to bed\n\n00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:14.252\nor enjoying well-earned leisure time.\n\n00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:15.726\nThat's why there's an overlap.\n\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.494\nSometimes they agree.\n\n00:06:17.518 --> 00:06:20.340\nBut other times, it makes much more sense\n\n00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:23.966\nto be doing things that are harder\nand less pleasant,\n\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.530\nfor the sake of the big picture.\n\n00:06:25.554 --> 00:06:27.443\nAnd that's when we have a conflict.\n\n00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:29.290\nAnd for the procrastinator,\n\n00:06:29.314 --> 00:06:31.823\nthat conflict tends to end\na certain way every time,\n\n00:06:31.847 --> 00:06:35.567\nleaving him spending a lot of time\nin this orange zone,\n\n00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:39.918\nan easy and fun place that's entirely\nout of the Makes Sense circle.\n\n00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:42.221\nI call it the Dark Playground.\n\n00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:43.869\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:47.021\nNow, the Dark Playground is a place\n\n00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:50.237\nthat all of you procrastinators\nout there know very well.\n\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.654\nIt's where leisure activities happen\n\n00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:55.988\nat times when leisure activities\nare not supposed to be happening.\n\n00:06:56.376 --> 00:06:58.266\nThe fun you have in the Dark Playground\n\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.773\nisn't actually fun,\nbecause it's completely unearned,\n\n00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:04.012\nand the air is filled with guilt,\ndread, anxiety, self-hatred --\n\n00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:06.154\nall of those good procrastinator feelings.\n\n00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:10.137\nAnd the question is, in this situation,\nwith the Monkey behind the wheel,\n\n00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:13.754\nhow does the procrastinator ever get\nhimself over here to this blue zone,\n\n00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:17.059\na less pleasant place, but where\nreally important things happen?\n\n00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:22.120\nWell, turns out the procrastinator\nhas a guardian angel,\n\n00:07:22.144 --> 00:07:25.352\nsomeone who's always looking\ndown on him and watching over him\n\n00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:26.806\nin his darkest moments --\n\n00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.925\nsomeone called the Panic Monster.\n\n00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.027\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:39.204\nNow, the Panic Monster\nis dormant most of the time,\n\n00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:43.130\nbut he suddenly wakes up\nanytime a deadline gets too close\n\n00:07:43.154 --> 00:07:45.199\nor there's danger of public embarrassment,\n\n00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:47.734\na career disaster or some other\nscary consequence.\n\n00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:51.930\nAnd importantly, he's the only thing\nthe Monkey is terrified of.\n\n00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:56.532\nNow, he became very relevant\nin my life pretty recently,\n\n00:07:56.556 --> 00:07:59.802\nbecause the people of TED\nreached out to me about six months ago\n\n00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:01.847\nand invited me to do a TED Talk.\n\n00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:04.299\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:08.923\nNow, of course, I said yes.\n\n00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:12.752\nIt's always been a dream of mine\nto have done a TED Talk in the past.\n\n00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:16.748\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:20.469\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:26.130\nBut in the middle of all this excitement,\n\n00:08:26.154 --> 00:08:29.455\nthe Rational Decision-Maker seemed\nto have something else on his mind.\n\n00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:32.027\nHe was saying, \"Are we clear\non what we just accepted?\n\n00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:35.300\nDo we get what's going to be now\nhappening one day in the future?\n\n00:08:35.324 --> 00:08:37.591\nWe need to sit down\nand work on this right now.\"\n\n00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:40.880\nAnd the Monkey said, \"Totally agree,\nbut let's just open Google Earth\n\n00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:44.064\nand zoom in to the bottom of India,\nlike 200 feet above the ground,\n\n00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:47.709\nand scroll up for two and a half hours\ntil we get to the top of the country,\n\n00:08:47.733 --> 00:08:49.711\nso we can get a better feel for India.\"\n\n00:08:49.735 --> 00:08:54.170\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:55.107 --> 00:08:56.592\nSo that's what we did that day.\n\n00:08:56.616 --> 00:08:59.286\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:04.458\nAs six months turned into four\nand then two and then one,\n\n00:09:04.482 --> 00:09:07.577\nthe people of TED decided\nto release the speakers.\n\n00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:10.213\nAnd I opened up the website,\nand there was my face\n\n00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:11.593\nstaring right back at me.\n\n00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.217\nAnd guess who woke up?\n\n00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:16.356\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:17.388 --> 00:09:19.838\nSo the Panic Monster\nstarts losing his mind,\n\n00:09:19.862 --> 00:09:22.608\nand a few seconds later,\nthe whole system's in mayhem.\n\n00:09:22.632 --> 00:09:25.078\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:30.570\nAnd the Monkey -- remember,\nhe's terrified of the Panic Monster --\n\n00:09:30.594 --> 00:09:31.752\nboom, he's up the tree!\n\n00:09:31.776 --> 00:09:32.927\nAnd finally,\n\n00:09:32.951 --> 00:09:35.547\nfinally, the Rational Decision-Maker\ncan take the wheel\n\n00:09:35.571 --> 00:09:37.289\nand I can start working on the talk.\n\n00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:39.601\nNow, the Panic Monster explains\n\n00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:43.106\nall kinds of pretty insane\nprocrastinator behavior,\n\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.464\nlike how someone like me\ncould spend two weeks\n\n00:09:45.488 --> 00:09:49.332\nunable to start the opening\nsentence of a paper,\n\n00:09:49.356 --> 00:09:52.127\nand then miraculously find\nthe unbelievable work ethic\n\n00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:55.247\nto stay up all night\nand write eight pages.\n\n00:09:56.343 --> 00:09:59.325\nAnd this entire situation,\nwith the three characters --\n\n00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.369\nthis is the procrastinator's system.\n\n00:10:02.054 --> 00:10:05.479\nIt's not pretty, but in the end, it works.\n\n00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:09.565\nThis is what I decided to write about\non the blog a couple of years ago.\n\n00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:12.560\nWhen I did, I was amazed by the response.\n\n00:10:12.584 --> 00:10:14.737\nLiterally thousands of emails came in,\n\n00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:17.538\nfrom all different kinds of people\nfrom all over the world,\n\n00:10:17.562 --> 00:10:19.300\ndoing all different kinds of things.\n\n00:10:19.324 --> 00:10:22.290\nThese are people who were nurses,\nbankers, painters, engineers\n\n00:10:22.314 --> 00:10:24.636\nand lots and lots of PhD students.\n\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.661\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:26.685 --> 00:10:28.973\nAnd they were all writing,\nsaying the same thing:\n\n00:10:28.997 --> 00:10:30.949\n\"I have this problem too.\"\n\n00:10:30.973 --> 00:10:34.802\nBut what struck me was the contrast\nbetween the light tone of the post\n\n00:10:34.826 --> 00:10:36.921\nand the heaviness of these emails.\n\n00:10:36.945 --> 00:10:40.028\nThese people were writing\nwith intense frustration\n\n00:10:40.052 --> 00:10:42.814\nabout what procrastination\nhad done to their lives,\n\n00:10:42.838 --> 00:10:44.868\nabout what this Monkey had done to them.\n\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.826\nAnd I thought about this, and I said,\n\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.962\nwell, if the procrastinator's system\nworks, then what's going on?\n\n00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.472\nWhy are all of these people\nin such a dark place?\n\n00:10:55.496 --> 00:10:58.794\nWell, it turns out that there's\ntwo kinds of procrastination.\n\n00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:02.779\nEverything I've talked about today,\nthe examples I've given,\n\n00:11:02.803 --> 00:11:03.954\nthey all have deadlines.\n\n00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:05.276\nAnd when there's deadlines,\n\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.225\nthe effects of procrastination\nare contained to the short term\n\n00:11:08.249 --> 00:11:10.162\nbecause the Panic Monster gets involved.\n\n00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:12.240\nBut there's a second kind\nof procrastination\n\n00:11:12.264 --> 00:11:14.751\nthat happens in situations\nwhen there is no deadline.\n\n00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:17.465\nSo if you wanted a career\nwhere you're a self-starter --\n\n00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:19.902\nsomething in the arts,\nsomething entrepreneurial --\n\n00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:23.451\nthere's no deadlines on those things\nat first, because nothing's happening,\n\n00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.719\nnot until you've gone out\nand done the hard work\n\n00:11:25.743 --> 00:11:27.369\nto get momentum, get things going.\n\n00:11:27.393 --> 00:11:30.471\nThere's also all kinds of important things\noutside of your career\n\n00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:32.100\nthat don't involve any deadlines,\n\n00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:35.389\nlike seeing your family or exercising\nand taking care of your health,\n\n00:11:35.413 --> 00:11:36.817\nworking on your relationship\n\n00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:39.522\nor getting out of a relationship\nthat isn't working.\n\n00:11:39.546 --> 00:11:44.694\nNow if the procrastinator's only mechanism\nof doing these hard things\n\n00:11:44.718 --> 00:11:46.603\nis the Panic Monster, that's a problem,\n\n00:11:46.627 --> 00:11:49.427\nbecause in all of these\nnon-deadline situations,\n\n00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:51.079\nthe Panic Monster doesn't show up.\n\n00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:52.555\nHe has nothing to wake up for,\n\n00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:55.277\nso the effects of procrastination,\nthey're not contained;\n\n00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.041\nthey just extend outward forever.\n\n00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.651\nAnd it's this long-term\nkind of procrastination\n\n00:12:00.675 --> 00:12:03.756\nthat's much less visible\nand much less talked about\n\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.681\nthan the funnier, short-term\ndeadline-based kind.\n\n00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:09.808\nIt's usually suffered\nquietly and privately.\n\n00:12:10.774 --> 00:12:11.928\nAnd it can be the source\n\n00:12:11.952 --> 00:12:15.687\nof a huge amount of long-term\nunhappiness, and regrets.\n\n00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:19.406\nAnd I thought, that's why\nthose people are emailing,\n\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.932\nand that's why they're\nin such a bad place.\n\n00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:24.700\nIt's not that they're cramming\nfor some project.\n\n00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:28.145\nIt's that long-term procrastination\nhas made them feel like a spectator,\n\n00:12:28.169 --> 00:12:30.208\nat times, in their own lives.\n\n00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:33.534\nThe frustration is not\nthat they couldn't achieve their dreams;\n\n00:12:33.558 --> 00:12:36.647\nit's that they weren't even\nable to start chasing them.\n\n00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:40.854\nSo I read these emails\nand I had a little bit of an epiphany --\n\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.540\nthat I don't think\nnon-procrastinators exist.\n\n00:12:45.937 --> 00:12:49.173\nThat's right -- I think all of you\nare procrastinators.\n\n00:12:49.856 --> 00:12:51.770\nNow, you might not all be a mess,\n\n00:12:51.794 --> 00:12:53.144\nlike some of us,\n\n00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:54.697\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:54.721 --> 00:12:58.037\nand some of you may have\na healthy relationship with deadlines,\n\n00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:00.585\nbut remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick\n\n00:13:00.609 --> 00:13:02.449\nis when the deadlines aren't there.\n\n00:13:03.207 --> 00:13:05.239\nNow, I want to show you one last thing.\n\n00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:07.636\nI call this a Life Calendar.\n\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.589\nThat's one box for every week\nof a 90-year life.\n\n00:13:13.303 --> 00:13:14.892\nThat's not that many boxes,\n\n00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:17.890\nespecially since we've already\nused a bunch of those.\n\n00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:23.697\nSo I think we need to all take a long,\nhard look at that calendar.\n\n00:13:24.935 --> 00:13:27.948\nWe need to think about what\nwe're really procrastinating on,\n\n00:13:27.972 --> 00:13:31.337\nbecause everyone is procrastinating\non something in life.\n\n00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.770\nWe need to stay aware\nof the Instant Gratification Monkey.\n\n00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:39.905\nThat's a job for all of us.\n\n00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:42.927\nAnd because there's not\nthat many boxes on there,\n\n00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:45.241\nit's a job that should\nprobably start today.\n\n00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:48.265\nWell, maybe not today, but ...\n\n00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:49.930\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.104\nYou know.\n\n00:13:51.534 --> 00:13:52.684\nSometime soon.\n\n00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:54.560\nThank you.\n\n00:13:54.584 --> 00:14:02.582\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The reporting system that sexual assault survivors want", "duration": "359", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_ladd_the_reporting_system_that_sexual_assault_survivors_want", "transcript": "Hannah is excited to be going to college. She couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house, to prove to them that she's an adult, and to prove to her new friends that she belongs.She heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on. Let's call him Mike. The next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache. She can only remember the night in flashes. But what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her, wanting it to stop, then shakily stumbling home. She doesn't feel good about what happened, but she thinks, \"Maybe this is just what sex in college is?\"One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the United States. Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school or to the police. And those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report.Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own. But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties, she's worried about them.After graduation, Hannah learns that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to. And this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders. But with such low reporting rates, it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported, much less anything happen if they are.In fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison. Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it. This means there's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States.Now, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training. I'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good. So this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem.So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago, it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change. And so we did. We started by talking to college survivors. And what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple; they wanted a website, one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them with clearly written information about their reporting options, with the ability to electronically report their assault, rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them. With the option to create a secure, timestamped document of what happened to them, preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet. And lastly, and perhaps most critically, with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant. You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything. It changes the way you frame your own experience, it changes the way you think about your perpetrator, it means that if you do come forward, you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.We created a website that actually does this and we launched it [...] in August, on two college campuses.And we included a unique matching system where if Mike's first victim had come forward, saved her record, entered into the matching system and named Mike, and Mike's second victim had done the same thing a few months later, they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time for investigation and follow up.If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers, it's more likely that they would have reported, that they would have been believed, and that Mike would have been kicked off campus, gone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed. And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match, survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place. We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on. And because we're creating a real deterrent to assault, for perhaps the first time, maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone.The type of system I'm describing, the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow, meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met, such as a match. The application that we built is for college campuses. But the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace.We don't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it. We can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable, where survivors get the support and justice they deserve, where the authorities get the information they need, and where there's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2457, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.478 -->

assault\n\n00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:16.278\nin the United States.\n\n00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:21.454\nNow, I'm an infectious disease\nepidemiologist by training.\n\n00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:24.574\nI'm interested in systems and networks\n\n00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:28.598\nand where we can concentrate\nour resources to do the most good.\n\n00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:34.278\nSo this, to me, is a tragic\nbut a solvable problem.\n\n00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:39.374\nSo when the issue of campus assault\nstarted hitting the news a few years ago,\n\n00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:42.774\nit felt like a unique opportunity\nto make a change.\n\n00:02:42.798 --> 00:02:43.998\nAnd so we did.\n\n00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:47.294\nWe started by talking\nto college survivors.\n\n00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.318\nAnd what they wish they'd had\nin college is pretty simple;\n\n00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:52.374\nthey wanted a website,\n\n00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:54.534\none they could use\nat the time and place\n\n00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:55.998\nthat felt safest to them\n\n00:02:56.758 --> 00:03:00.734\nwith clearly written information\nabout their reporting options,\n\n00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.894\nwith the ability to electronically\nreport their assault,\n\n00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:05.534\nrather than having the first step\n\n00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:08.438\nto go in and talk to someone\nwho may or may not believe them.\n\n00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:12.334\nWith the option to create\na secure, timestamped document\n\n00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.854\nof what happened to them,\n\n00:03:13.878 --> 00:03:16.918\npreserving evidence\neven if they don't want to report yet.\n\n00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:20.494\nAnd lastly, and perhaps most critically,\n\n00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:22.534\nwith the ability to report their assault\n\n00:03:22.558 --> 00:03:26.198\nonly if someone else\nreported the same assailant.\n\n00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:30.014\nYou see, knowing that you weren't\nthe only one changes everything.\n\n00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:32.374\nIt changes the way\nyou frame your own experience,\n\n00:03:32.398 --> 00:03:34.854\nit changes the way\nyou think about your perpetrator,\n\n00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:36.694\nit means that if you do come forward,\n\n00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:39.758\nyou'll have someone else's back\nand they'll have yours.\n\n00:03:40.798 --> 00:03:43.294\nWe created a website\nthat actually does this\n\n00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:46.334\nand we launched it [...] in August,\n\n00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:47.958\non two college campuses.\n\n00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:51.454\nAnd we included a unique matching system\n\n00:03:51.478 --> 00:03:54.414\nwhere if Mike's first victim\nhad come forward,\n\n00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:57.214\nsaved her record,\nentered into the matching system\n\n00:03:57.238 --> 00:03:58.494\nand named Mike,\n\n00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:00.894\nand Mike's second victim\nhad done the same thing\n\n00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:02.574\na few months later,\n\n00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:03.934\nthey would have matched\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.454\nand the verified contact information\nof both survivors\n\n00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:10.214\nwould have been sent\nto the authorities at the same time\n\n00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:12.278\nfor investigation and follow up.\n\n00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:17.254\nIf a system like this had existed\nfor Hannah and her peers,\n\n00:04:17.278 --> 00:04:19.814\nit's more likely\nthat they would have reported,\n\n00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:21.614\nthat they would have been believed,\n\n00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:23.894\nand that Mike would have been\nkicked off campus,\n\n00:04:23.918 --> 00:04:26.918\ngone to jail, or at least\ngotten the help that he needed.\n\n00:04:27.878 --> 00:04:31.374\nAnd if we were able to stop\nrepeat offenders like Mike\n\n00:04:31.398 --> 00:04:35.014\nafter just their second assault\nfollowing a match,\n\n00:04:35.038 --> 00:04:37.654\nsurvivors like Hannah\nwould never even be assaulted\n\n00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:38.958\nin the first place.\n\n00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:43.814\nWe could prevent\n59 percent of sexual assaults\n\n00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:46.918\njust by stopping\nrepeat perpetrators earlier on.\n\n00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.734\nAnd because we're creating\na real deterrent to assault,\n\n00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:52.894\nfor perhaps the first time,\n\n00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:56.278\nmaybe the Mikes of the world\nwould never even try to assault anyone.\n\n00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:00.574\nThe type of system I'm describing,\n\n00:05:00.598 --> 00:05:02.974\nthe type of system that survivors want\n\n00:05:02.998 --> 00:05:05.534\nis a type of information escrow,\n\n00:05:05.558 --> 00:05:08.774\nmeaning an entity that holds on\nto information for you\n\n00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:11.254\nand only releases it to a third party\n\n00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:13.854\nwhen certain pre-agreed upon\nconditions are met,\n\n00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:15.078\nsuch as a match.\n\n00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:19.294\nThe application that we built\nis for college campuses.\n\n00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:22.374\nBut the same type of system\ncould be used in the military\n\n00:05:22.398 --> 00:05:23.798\nor even the workplace.\n\n00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:28.214\nWe don't have to live in a world\n\n00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:31.398\nwhere 99 percent of rapists\nget away with it.\n\n00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:33.494\nWe can create one\n\n00:05:33.518 --> 00:05:36.454\nwhere those who do wrong\nare held accountable,\n\n00:05:36.478 --> 00:05:39.894\nwhere survivors get the support\nand justice they deserve,\n\n00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:42.814\nwhere the authorities\nget the information they need,\n\n00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:44.734\nand where there's a real deterrent\n\n00:05:44.758 --> 00:05:48.398\nto violating the rights\nof another human being.\n\n00:05:49.078 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_brooks_a_conservative_s_plea_let_s_work_together", "transcript": "I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States, Seattle, Washington. And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites. My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I am truly grateful for my upbringing, because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit.And in point of fact, I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind. When I was 19, I dropped out of college \u2014 dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.(Laughter)And I went on the road as a professional French horn player, which was my lifelong dream. I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe, and I toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird. And by the end of my 20s, I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain. What a great life.And you know, my parents never complained. They supported me all the way through it. It wasn't their dream. They used to tell their neighbors and friends, \"Our son, he's taking a gap decade.\"(Laughter)And \u2014 There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about. I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona, and I was visiting my parents for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen. And she was quiet, too quiet. Something was wrong. And so I said, \"Mom, what's on your mind?\" And she said, \"Your dad and I are really worried about you.\" And I said, \"What?\" I mean, what could it be, at this point? And she said, \"I want you to be completely honest with me: have you been voting for Republicans?\"(Laughter)Now, the truth is, I wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player. But I had a bit of an epiphany, and they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion. You see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism, and I want to tell you why that is. It stems from a lifelong interest of mine in, believe it or not, poverty.See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty. We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty. That's not even close. The first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face, was when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s. And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite. It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine of a kid who was my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a distended belly. And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless. Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, one just like it. It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world. Well, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dropped out and dropped in and started my family. And I wondered, what happened to that kid? Or to people just like him all over the world? And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for the answer: what happened to the world's poorest people? Has it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?And I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.See \u2014 most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children, since they saw that vision. If you ask Americans, \"Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?\", 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s. But here's the truth. Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking. From 1970 until today, the percentage of the world's population living in starvation levels, living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation, that percentage has declined by 80 percent. There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a kid. And I didn't even know about it. This, my friends, that's a miracle. That's something we ought to celebrate. It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind, and it happened in our lifetimes.(Applause)So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible? Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again. If you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid, two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters, have been pulled out of poverty. I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why. And I went in search of an answer. And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care. You know what, I still don't care. I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists left, right and center.And here it is. Here are the reasons. There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid. Number one: globalization. Number two: free trade. Number three: property rights. Number four: rule of law. Number five: entrepreneurship. It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after 1970 that did that.Now, I'm not naive. I know that free enterprise isn't perfect, and I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need to build a better world. But that is great. And that's beyond politics. Here's what I learned. This is the epiphany. Capitalism is not just about accumulation. At its best, it's about aspiration, which is what so many people on this stage talk about, is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system. And we've got to share it with more people.Now, I want to tell you about a second epiphany that's related to that first one that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world, but right here at home. The best quote I've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that I've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows: \"Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history. They have lifted billions out of poverty.\"Who said it? It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan. Wrong. President Barack Obama said that. Why do I know it by heart? Because he said it to me. Crazy. And I said, \"Hallelujah.\" But more than that, I said, \"What an opportunity.\"You know what I was thinking? It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Georgetown University in May of 2015. And I thought, this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What? It's coming together around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help people who need us the most.Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world with political polarization. It's risen to critical, crisis levels. It's unpleasant. It's not right. There was an article last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the West. And it was an article in 2014 on political motive asymmetry. What's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents' ideology is based in hate. It's common in world conflict. You expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example. What the authors of this article found was that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry. A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate. Think about it. Think about it. Most people are walking around saying, \"You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence, I want to help people, but the other guys, they're evil and out to get me.\" You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry. It's impossible.How do we solve it? Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences. Let's not minimize the differences. That would be really na\u00efve. There's a lot of good research on this. A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt. He's a psychology professor at New York University. He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ. And he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals have a very different emphasis on what they think is important. For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic liberty. And conservatives care about economic liberty 28 percent more than they care about poverty.Irreconcilable differences, right? We'll never come together. Wrong. That is diversity in which lies our strength. Remember what pulled up the poor. It was the obsession with poverty, accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world. We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty. There's no other way.Hmm. How are we going to get that? It's a tricky thing, isn't it. We need innovative thinking. A lot of it's on this stage. Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal. We need investment overseas in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.But you know what we really need? We need a new day in flexible ideology. We need to be less predictable. Don't we? Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable? Kinda conventional? Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you? Why is that dangerous? Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, conservatives, you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government. And on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality. Right? Now those are important things, really important to me, really important to you. But when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today, those are distractions. We need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets. That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country, if we choose to take it.So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together? I've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me. Number one. Action item number one: remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree. It's not good enough. We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools. Now, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that? Where does this start? It starts here. You know, all of us in this room, we're blessed. We're blessed with people who listen to us. We're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership. When people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology, then maybe people will listen. Maybe progress will start at that point. That's number one. Number two. Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me to be the person specifically who blurs the lines, who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify. If you're a conservative, be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor. And if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly.If we do that, we get two things. Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get. And the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect. And then maybe, just maybe, we'll all realize that our big differences aren't really that big after all.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2456, "subtitle":

voting for Republicans?\"\n\n00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:09.798\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:14.014\nNow, the truth is,\n\n00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:18.414\nI wasn't really political,\nI was just a French horn player.\n\n00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:21.973\nBut I had a bit of an epiphany,\n\n00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:24.854\nand they had detected it,\nand it was causing some confusion.\n\n00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:29.558\nYou see, I had become\nan enthusiast for capitalism,\n\n00:02:30.158 --> 00:02:32.774\nand I want to tell you why that is.\n\n00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:36.934\nIt stems from a lifelong interest of mine\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.918\nin, believe it or not, poverty.\n\n00:02:39.878 --> 00:02:42.214\nSee, when I was a kid\ngrowing up in Seattle,\n\n00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:45.854\nI remember the first time\nI saw real poverty.\n\n00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:50.254\nWe were a lower middle class family,\nbut that's of course not real poverty.\n\n00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:52.014\nThat's not even close.\n\n00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:55.454\nThe first time I saw poverty,\nand poverty's face,\n\n00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:58.294\nwas when I was six\nor seven years old, early 1970s.\n\n00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:02.854\nAnd it was like a lot of you,\nkind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.\n\n00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:06.254\nIt was a picture in the National\nGeographic Magazine\n\n00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:10.574\nof a kid who was my age in East Africa,\n\n00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:13.174\nand there were flies on his face\nand a distended belly.\n\n00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:18.118\nAnd he wasn't going to make it,\nand I knew that, and I was helpless.\n\n00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:20.654\nSome of you remember that picture,\n\n00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:22.694\nnot exactly that picture,\none just like it.\n\n00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:27.518\nIt introduced the West\nto grinding poverty around the world.\n\n00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:32.974\nWell, that vision kind of haunted me\nas I grew up and I went to school\n\n00:03:32.998 --> 00:03:34.774\nand I dropped out and dropped in\n\n00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.758\nand started my family.\n\n00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:39.454\nAnd I wondered, what happened to that kid?\n\n00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:42.158\nOr to people just like him\nall over the world?\n\n00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:45.934\nAnd so I started to study,\neven though I wasn't in college,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.374\nI was looking for the answer:\n\n00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:49.494\nwhat happened to the world's\npoorest people?\n\n00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:51.774\nHas it gotten worse?\nHas it gotten better? What?\n\n00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:54.574\nAnd I found the answer,\nand it changed my life,\n\n00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:56.158\nand I want to share it with you.\n\n00:03:56.998 --> 00:03:58.198\nSee --\n\n00:03:59.718 --> 00:04:03.974\nmost Americans believe\nthat poverty has gotten worse\n\n00:04:03.998 --> 00:04:07.134\nsince we were children,\nsince they saw that vision.\n\n00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.814\nIf you ask Americans, \"Has poverty\ngotten worse or better around the world?\",\n\n00:04:10.838 --> 00:04:14.174\n70 percent will say that hunger\nhas gotten worse since the early 1970s.\n\n00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:15.694\nBut here's the truth.\n\n00:04:15.718 --> 00:04:19.414\nHere's the epiphany that I had\nthat changed my thinking.\n\n00:04:19.438 --> 00:04:22.198\nFrom 1970 until today,\n\n00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:25.694\nthe percentage of the world's population\n\n00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:27.734\nliving in starvation levels,\n\n00:04:27.758 --> 00:04:31.414\nliving on a dollar a day or less,\nobviously adjusted for inflation,\n\n00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.654\nthat percentage has declined\n\n00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:36.358\nby 80 percent.\n\n00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:40.014\nThere's been an 80 percent decline\nin the world's worst poverty\n\n00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:41.254\nsince I was a kid.\n\n00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:42.854\nAnd I didn't even know about it.\n\n00:04:42.878 --> 00:04:44.758\nThis, my friends, that's a miracle.\n\n00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:47.574\nThat's something we ought to celebrate.\n\n00:04:47.598 --> 00:04:51.854\nIt's the greatest antipoverty achievement\nin the history of mankind,\n\n00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:54.414\nand it happened in our lifetimes.\n\n00:04:54.438 --> 00:04:57.974\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:02.854\nSo when I learned this, I asked,\nwhat did that? What made it possible?\n\n00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:05.694\nBecause if you don't know why,\nyou can't do it again.\n\n00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:07.054\nIf you want to replicate it\n\n00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:09.614\nand get the next two billion\npeople out of poverty,\n\n00:05:09.638 --> 00:05:12.414\nbecause that's what we're talking about:\nsince I was a kid,\n\n00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:15.254\ntwo billion of the least of these,\nour brothers and sisters,\n\n00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:16.814\nhave been pulled out of poverty.\n\n00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:19.324\nI want the next two billion,\nso I've got to know why.\n\n00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:20.974\nAnd I went in search of an answer.\n\n00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:23.654\nAnd it wasn't a political answer,\nbecause I didn't care.\n\n00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:25.334\nYou know what, I still don't care.\n\n00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:30.174\nI wanted the best answer\nfrom mainstream economists\n\n00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:32.318\nleft, right and center.\n\n00:05:32.838 --> 00:05:34.038\nAnd here it is.\n\n00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:35.774\nHere are the reasons.\n\n00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:39.534\nThere are five reasons that two billion\nof our brothers and sisters\n\n00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:41.934\nhave been pulled out of poverty\nsince I was a kid.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.478\nNumber one: globalization.\n\n00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:47.134\nNumber two: free trade.\n\n00:05:47.158 --> 00:05:49.494\nNumber three: property rights.\n\n00:05:49.518 --> 00:05:52.054\nNumber four: rule of law.\n\n00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:55.054\nNumber five: entrepreneurship.\n\n00:05:55.078 --> 00:05:59.334\nIt was the free enterprise system\nspreading around the world\n\n00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.134\nafter 1970 that did that.\n\n00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:03.574\nNow, I'm not naive.\n\n00:06:03.598 --> 00:06:06.054\nI know that free enterprise isn't perfect,\n\n00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:09.214\nand I know that free enterprise\nisn't everything we need\n\n00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.454\nto build a better world.\n\n00:06:10.478 --> 00:06:13.014\nBut that is great.\n\n00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:14.374\nAnd that's beyond politics.\n\n00:06:14.398 --> 00:06:16.494\nHere's what I learned.\nThis is the epiphany.\n\n00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:19.534\nCapitalism is not just about accumulation.\n\n00:06:19.558 --> 00:06:22.094\nAt its best, it's about aspiration,\n\n00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:24.814\nwhich is what so many people\non this stage talk about,\n\n00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:28.054\nis the aspiration that comes from dreams\n\n00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:30.334\nthat are embedded\nin the free enterprise system.\n\n00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:32.534\nAnd we've got to share it\nwith more people.\n\n00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.774\nNow, I want to tell you\nabout a second epiphany\n\n00:06:35.798 --> 00:06:38.294\nthat's related to that first one\n\n00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:41.374\nthat I think can bring us progress,\nnot just around the world,\n\n00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:42.638\nbut right here at home.\n\n00:06:43.798 --> 00:06:45.814\nThe best quote I've ever heard\n\n00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:49.414\nto summarize the thoughts\nthat I've just given you\n\n00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:51.494\nabout pulling people out of poverty\n\n00:06:51.518 --> 00:06:53.614\nis as follows:\n\n00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:58.494\n\"Free markets have created more wealth\nthan any system in history.\n\n00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:01.318\nThey have lifted billions out of poverty.\"\n\n00:07:02.358 --> 00:07:03.614\nWho said it?\n\n00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:07.038\nIt sounds like Milton Friedman\nor Ronald Reagan.\n\n00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:08.958\nWrong.\n\n00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:11.678\nPresident Barack Obama said that.\n\n00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.998\nWhy do I know it by heart?\n\n00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:16.358\nBecause he said it to me.\n\n00:07:17.598 --> 00:07:19.094\nCrazy.\n\n00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:21.798\nAnd I said, \"Hallelujah.\"\n\n00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:25.254\nBut more than that, I said,\n\n00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.974\n\"What an opportunity.\"\n\n00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:28.494\nYou know what I was thinking?\n\n00:07:28.518 --> 00:07:30.974\nIt was at an event\nthat we were doing on the subject\n\n00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:32.934\nat Georgetown University in May of 2015.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.734\nAnd I thought, this is the solution\n\n00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:39.254\nto the biggest problem\nfacing America today. What?\n\n00:07:39.278 --> 00:07:42.054\nIt's coming together around these ideas,\n\n00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:43.814\nliberals and conservatives,\n\n00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.918\nto help people who need us the most.\n\n00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:50.734\nNow, I don't have to tell anybody\nin this room that we're in a crisis,\n\n00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:54.334\nin America and many countries around\nthe world with political polarization.\n\n00:07:54.358 --> 00:07:56.254\nIt's risen to critical, crisis levels.\n\n00:07:56.278 --> 00:07:58.678\nIt's unpleasant. It's not right.\n\n00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.934\nThere was an article last year\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.574\nin the Proceedings\nof the National Academy of Sciences,\n\n00:08:03.598 --> 00:08:07.078\nwhich is one of the most\nprestigious scientific journals\n\n00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:09.294\npublished in the West.\n\n00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:11.774\nAnd it was an article in 2014\n\n00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:14.214\non political motive asymmetry.\n\n00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:16.953\nWhat's that?

Think about it.\n\n00:08:50.918 --> 00:08:53.093\nMost people are walking around saying,\n\n00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:56.294\n\"You know, my ideology\nis based on basic benevolence,\n\n00:08:56.318 --> 00:08:57.534\nI want to help people,\n\n00:08:57.558 --> 00:09:00.358\nbut the other guys,\nthey're evil and out to get me.\"\n\n00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:06.454\nYou can't progress as a society\nwhen you have this kind of asymmetry.\n\n00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:07.678\nIt's impossible.\n\n00:09:08.518 --> 00:09:09.774\nHow do we solve it?\n\n00:09:09.798 --> 00:09:13.454\nWell, first, let's be honest:\nthere are differences.\n\n00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:17.174\nLet's not minimize the differences.\nThat would be really na\u00efve.\n\n00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:19.254\nThere's a lot of good research on this.\n\n00:09:19.278 --> 00:09:22.414\nA veteran of the TED stage\nis my friend Jonathan Haidt.\n\n00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:25.494\nHe's a psychology professor\nat New York University.\n\n00:09:25.518 --> 00:09:30.454\nHe does work on the ideology\nand values and morals of different people\n\n00:09:30.478 --> 00:09:31.718\nto see how they differ.\n\n00:09:32.318 --> 00:09:35.128\nAnd he's shown, for example,\nthat conservatives and liberals\n\n00:09:35.152 --> 00:09:38.168\nhave a very different emphasis\non what they think is important.\n\n00:09:38.192 --> 00:09:41.494\nFor example, Jon Haidt has shown\n\n00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:44.494\nthat liberals care about poverty\n\n00:09:44.518 --> 00:09:47.398\n59 percent more than they care\nabout economic liberty.\n\n00:09:48.238 --> 00:09:50.734\nAnd conservatives\ncare about economic liberty\n\n00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:53.918\n28 percent more\nthan they care about poverty.\n\n00:09:54.878 --> 00:09:56.934\nIrreconcilable differences, right?\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWe'll never come together.

Yes.\n\n00:10:44.998 --> 00:10:46.814\nBut you know what we really need?\n\n00:10:46.838 --> 00:10:51.454\nWe need a new day in flexible ideology.\n\n00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:54.038\nWe need to be less predictable.\n\n00:10:54.638 --> 00:10:55.854\nDon't we?\n\n00:10:55.878 --> 00:11:00.454\nDo you ever feel like your own ideology\nis starting to get predictable?\n\n00:11:00.478 --> 00:11:02.214\nKinda conventional?\n\n00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:06.374\nDo you ever feel like you're always\nlistening to people who agree with you?\n\n00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:08.134\nWhy is that dangerous?\n\n00:11:08.158 --> 00:11:11.734\nBecause when we talk\nin this country about economics,\n\n00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.414\non the right, conservatives,\n\n00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:18.078\nyou're always talking about taxes\nand regulations and big government.\n\n00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:21.574\nAnd on the left, liberals,\nyou're talking about economics,\n\n00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.854\nit's always about income inequality.\n\n00:11:23.878 --> 00:11:27.294\nRight? Now those are important things,\n\n00:11:27.318 --> 00:11:29.574\nreally important to me,\nreally important to you.\n\n00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:32.134\nBut when it comes to lifting people up\n\n00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:36.614\nwho are starving and need us today,\nthose are distractions.\n\n00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:40.054\nWe need to come together\naround the best ways\n\n00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:43.414\nto mitigate poverty\nusing the best tools at our disposal,\n\n00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:47.934\nand that comes only when conservatives\nrecognize that they need liberals\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.574\nand their obsession with poverty,\n\n00:11:49.598 --> 00:11:54.718\nand liberals need conservatives\nand their obsession with free markets.\n\n00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:59.694\nThat's the diversity in which lies\nthe future strength of this country,\n\n00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:01.678\nif we choose to take it.\n\n00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:05.774\nSo how are we going to do it?\nHow are we going to do it together?\n\n00:12:05.798 --> 00:12:08.958\nI've got to have some action items,\nnot just for you but for me.\n\n00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:12.254\nNumber one. Action item number one:\n\n00:12:12.278 --> 00:12:17.494\nremember, it's not good enough\njust to tolerate people who disagree.\n\n00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:19.214\nIt's not good enough.\n\n00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:23.134\nWe have to remember that we need\npeople who disagree with us,\n\n00:12:23.158 --> 00:12:25.494\nbecause there are people\nwho need all of us\n\n00:12:25.518 --> 00:12:27.958\nwho are still waiting for these tools.\n\n00:12:28.638 --> 00:12:31.934\nNow, what are you going to do?\nHow are you going to express that?\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.894\nWhere does this start? It starts here.\n\n00:12:33.918 --> 00:12:37.174\nYou know, all of us\nin this room, we're blessed.\n\n00:12:37.198 --> 00:12:39.254\nWe're blessed with people\nwho listen to us.\n\n00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:42.174\nWe're blessed with prosperity.\nWe're blessed with leadership.\n\n00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:46.598\nWhen people hear us,\nwith the kind of unpredictable ideology,\n\n00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:49.574\nthen maybe people will listen.\n\n00:12:49.598 --> 00:12:51.774\nMaybe progress will start at that point.\n\n00:12:51.798 --> 00:12:53.558\nThat's number one. Number two.\n\n00:12:54.118 --> 00:12:57.918\nNumber two: I'm asking you\nand I'm asking me\n\n00:12:58.638 --> 00:13:03.014\nto be the person specifically\nwho blurs the lines,\n\n00:13:03.038 --> 00:13:06.318\nwho is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.\n\n00:13:07.118 --> 00:13:08.374\nIf you're a conservative,\n\n00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:11.934\nbe the conservative\nwho is always going on about poverty\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.774\nand the moral obligation\nto be a warrior for the poor.\n\n00:13:14.798 --> 00:13:18.494\nAnd if you're a liberal,\nbe a liberal who is always talking\n\n00:13:18.518 --> 00:13:23.094\nabout the beauty of free markets\nto solve our problems\n\n00:13:23.118 --> 00:13:24.718\nwhen we use them responsibly.\n\n00:13:25.278 --> 00:13:28.014\nIf we do that, we get two things.\n\n00:13:28.038 --> 00:13:32.614\nNumber one: we get to start\nto work on the next two billion\n\n00:13:32.638 --> 00:13:36.174\nand be the solution\nthat we've seen so much of in the past\n\n00:13:36.198 --> 00:13:39.094\nand we need to see more of in the future.\nThat's what we get.\n\n00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:42.094\nAnd the second is\nthat we might just be able\n\n00:13:42.118 --> 00:13:46.774\nto take the ghastly holy war of ideology\nthat we're suffering under in this country\n\n00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:51.054\nand turn it into a competition of ideas\n\n00:13:51.078 --> 00:13:54.054\nbased on solidarity and mutual respect.\n\n00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:57.934\nAnd then maybe, just maybe,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.638\nwe'll all realize that our big differences\n\n00:14:02.318 --> 00:14:04.438\naren't really that big after all.\n\n00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:06.574\nThank you.\n\n00:14:06.598 --> 00:14:13.426\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A glimpse of the future through an augmented reality headset", "duration": "654", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/meron_gribetz_a_glimpse_of_the_future_through_an_augmented_reality_headset", "transcript": "Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are. I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.First, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011 that had a profound impact on me. I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University, where I studied computer science and neuroscience, and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers. And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation, of course, his phone lights up. And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing. And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes, \"Keep going. I'm with you.\" But of course his eyes were glazed over, and the moment was dead.Meanwhile across the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time towards a group. He was swiping through pictures on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically. And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology, really got me thinking. And the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here, it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together.See, they were connected around something, just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire. And that's exactly what tools should do, I think. They should extend our bodies. And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite. Whether you're sending an email to your wife or you're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend, you're doing it in pretty much the same way. You're hunched over these rectangles, fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles. And I think this is the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine. We should use machines that bring our work back into the world. We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them.Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here. It's called the Meta 2. Let's try it out. Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience, and I can see my very hands. And in three, two, one, we're going to see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appear in front of me, of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now. And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for or learning from, and I can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control. And I think Iron Man would be proud. We're going to come back to this in just a bit.(Applause)Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology, so let's look at a few.My mom is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was laying out a building in 3D space instead of having to use these 2D floor plans. She's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor. This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.And this next use case is very personal to me, it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project, courtesy of UCSF. As a neuroscience student, I would always fantasize about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine, where I could touch and play with the various brain structures.Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but to me, it's part of a much more important story \u2014 a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices, instead of the other way around.Now ... in the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think. We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world. Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today. And what I think we need to do as a community, is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information. And that's what I'm very passionate about.Now, I want to tell you a little secret. In about five years \u2014 this is not the smallest device \u2014 in about five years, these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms. And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware \u2014 we buy it for the operating system \u2014 as a neuroscientist, I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will. And it's very, very important that we get this right, because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we've lived with the Windows graphical user interface. And I don't know about you, but living inside of Windows scares me.(Laughter)To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity, we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines, instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom. And the principle we all revolve around is what's called the \"Neural Path of Least Resistance.\"At every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain on, for the first time, our brain's terms. In other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer. We're building a system that you've always known how to use.Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this brand-new form of user experience. First and foremost, you are the operating system. Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they take your brain extra steps to decode them. We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance. Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here, and your holographic email on the other side of the desk, and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them. You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for \u2014 or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.(Laughter)Perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.The second interface guideline we call \"touch to see.\" What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest? They try and reach out and touch it. And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well. Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception \u2014 that's the sense of our body parts in space. So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better, we're also going to understand it much more deeply. Hence, touch to see.But it's not enough to experience things ourselves. We're inherently these social primates. And this leads me to our third guideline, the holographic campfire from our first story.Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D. So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around this thing, instead of being distracted by external devices.Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind. So again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind. I'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk. I'm now with you, I'm in the moment, we're connecting. My spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here, reminding me that I am the operating system. And now my proprioception is working, and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.But it's not enough to see things alone, so in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call \u2014 Ray?(Ringing)Hey Ray, how's it going? Guys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D. And he is photo-realistic.(Applause)Thank you.My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long. Ray, how's it going?Ray: Great. We're live today.(Applause)MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier. Guys, this is not only going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we collaborate.Thank you so much.Thanks, Ray.Ray: You're welcome.(Applause)MG: So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens. It's right here, inside of us.(Applause)So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today, it's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future, it's right here in 2016. Which is why all hundred of us at Meta, including the administrative staff, the executives, the designers, the engineers \u2014 before TED2017, we're all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.Thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks, guys.Chris Anderson: So help me out on one thing, because there've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there. And there's sometimes a debate among technologists about, are we really seeing the real thing on-screen? There's this issue of field of view, that somehow the technology is showing a broader view than you would actually see wearing the glasses. Were we seeing the real deal there?MG: Absolutely the real deal. Not only that, we took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens in the various videos that you've seen here. We want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we're actually seeing through the glasses, and not cut any corners.CA: Thank you so much for showing us that.MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.", "id": 2459, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.744\nToday's computers are so amazing\n\n00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:20.889\nthat we fail to notice\nhow terrible they really are.\n\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.528\nI'd like to talk to you today\nabout this problem,\n\n00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:27.223\nand how we can fix it with neuroscience.\n\n00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:32.031\nFirst, I'd like to take you back\nto a frosty night in Harlem in 2011\n\n00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:33.842\nthat had a profound impact on me.\n\n00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:37.569\nI was sitting in a dive bar\noutside of Columbia University,\n\n00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:40.501\nwhere I studied computer science\nand neuroscience,\n\n00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.593\nand I was having this great conversation\nwith a fellow student\n\n00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:46.920\nabout the power of holograms\nto one day replace computers.\n\n00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:50.437\nAnd just as we were getting\nto the best part of the conversation,\n\n00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.023\nof course, his phone lights up.\n\n00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.004\nAnd he pulls it towards himself,\nand he looks down and he starts typing.\n\n00:00:57.028 --> 00:01:00.211\nAnd then he forces his eyeballs\nback up to mine and he goes,\n\n00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:02.338\n\"Keep going.

glasses I'm wearing\non my head right now.\n\n00:02:52.853 --> 00:02:55.694\nAnd of course this could be\nanything that we're shopping for\n\n00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:56.869\nor learning from,\n\n00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:58.236\nand I can use my hands\n\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.368\nto very nicely kind of move\nit around with fine control.\n\n00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:05.587\nAnd I think Iron Man would be proud.\n\n00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:08.979\nWe're going to come back\nto this in just a bit.\n\n00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:11.905\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.840\nNow if you're anything like me,\nyour mind is already reeling\n\n00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:18.165\nwith the possibilities of what we can do\nwith this kind of technology,\n\n00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.347\nso let's look at a few.\n\n00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:20.521\nMy mom is an architect,\n\n00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:22.450\nso naturally the first thing I imagined\n\n00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:24.955\nwas laying out a building in 3D space\n\n00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.371\ninstead of having to use\nthese 2D floor plans.\n\n00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:29.860\nShe's actually touching graphics right now\n\n00:03:29.884 --> 00:03:31.661\nand selecting an interior decor.\n\n00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.049\nThis was all shot through a GoPro\nthrough our very glasses.\n\n00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:37.688\nAnd this next use case\nis very personal to me,\n\n00:03:37.712 --> 00:03:41.126\nit's Professor Adam Gazzaley's\nglass brain project,\n\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.041\ncourtesy of UCSF.\n\n00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.760\nAs a neuroscience student,\n\n00:03:44.784 --> 00:03:46.181\nI would always fantasize\n\n00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:51.644\nabout the ability to learn and memorize\nthese complex brain structures\n\n00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:52.835\nwith an actual machine,\n\n00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.161\nwhere I could touch and play\nwith the various brain structures.\n\n00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:00.019\nNow what you're seeing\nis called augmented reality,\n\n00:04:00.043 --> 00:04:02.994\nbut to me, it's part\nof a much more important story --\n\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.161\na story of how we can begin\nto extend our bodies with digital devices,\n\n00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:12.669\ninstead of the other way around.\n\n00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:15.161\nNow ...\n\n00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:18.547\nin the next few years, humanity's\ngoing to go through a shift, I think.\n\n00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:21.784\nWe're going to start putting\nan entire layer of digital information\n\n00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:23.243\non the real world.\n\n00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:25.276\nJust imagine for a moment\n\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.560\nwhat this could mean for storytellers,\n\n00:04:27.584 --> 00:04:28.899\nfor painters,\n\n00:04:28.923 --> 00:04:31.081\nfor brain surgeons,\n\n00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.922\nfor interior decorators\n\n00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.057\nand maybe for all of us here today.\n\n00:04:35.502 --> 00:04:37.669\nAnd what I think we need\nto do as a community,\n\n00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:39.685\nis really try and make an effort\n\n00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.600\nto imagine how we can\ncreate this new reality\n\n00:04:42.624 --> 00:04:45.322\nin a way that extends\nthe human experience,\n\n00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:47.314\ninstead of gamifying our reality\n\n00:04:47.338 --> 00:04:49.401\nor cluttering it with digital information.\n\n00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:51.547\nAnd that's what I'm very passionate about.\n\n00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:54.437\nNow, I want to tell you a little secret.\n\n00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.628\nIn about five years --\n\n00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:57.278\nthis is not the smallest device --\n\n00:04:57.302 --> 00:04:58.470\nin about five years,\n\n00:04:58.494 --> 00:05:01.422\nthese are all going to look like\nstrips of glass on our eyes\n\n00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:02.765\nthat project holograms.\n\n00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:06.694\nAnd just like we don't care so much\nabout which phone we buy\n\n00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:10.139\nin terms of the hardware -- we buy it\nfor the operating system --\n\n00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:11.322\nas a neuroscientist,\n\n00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:15.389\nI always dreamt of building\nthe iOS of the mind, if you will.\n\n00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:19.375\nAnd it's very, very important\nthat we get this right,\n\n00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:21.693\nbecause we might be living\ninside of these things\n\n00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:23.405\nfor at least as long as we've lived\n\n00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:26.070\nwith the Windows graphical user interface.\n\n00:05:26.094 --> 00:05:27.411\nAnd I don't know about you,\n\n00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:29.943\nbut living inside of Windows scares me.\n\n00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:31.287\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:35.201\nTo isolate the single most intuitive\ninterface out of infinity,\n\n00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:37.905\nwe use neuroscience to drive\nour design guidelines,\n\n00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:41.519\ninstead of letting a bunch of designers\nfight it out in the boardroom.\n\n00:05:41.543 --> 00:05:44.192\nAnd the principle we all revolve around\n\n00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:47.224\nis what's called the \"Neural Path\nof Least Resistance.\"\n\n00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:51.379\nAt every turn, we're connecting\nthe iOS of the brain with our brain\n\n00:05:51.403 --> 00:05:53.789\non, for the first time, our brain's terms.\n\n00:05:53.813 --> 00:05:58.205\nIn other words, we're trying to create\na zero learning-curve computer.\n\n00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:02.031\nWe're building a system\nthat you've always known how to use.\n\n00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:04.948\nHere are the first three\ndesign guidelines that we employ\n\n00:06:04.972 --> 00:06:07.303\nin this brand-new form of user experience.\n\n00:06:07.327 --> 00:06:10.721\nFirst and foremost,\nyou are the operating system.\n\n00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.452\nTraditional file systems\nare complex and abstract,\n\n00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:16.067\nand they take your brain\nextra steps to decode them.\n\n00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:18.896\nWe're going against the Neural Path\nof Least Resistance.\n\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.118\nMeanwhile, in augmented reality,\n\n00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:26.117\nyou can of course place\nyour holographic TED panel over here,\n\n00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:29.692\nand your holographic email\non the other side of the desk,\n\n00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:35.539\nand your spatial memory evolved just fine\nto go ahead and retrieve them.\n\n00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:38.591\nYou could put your holographic Tesla\nthat you're shopping for --\n\n00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:42.120\nor whatever model my legal team\ntold me to put in right before the show.\n\n00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:43.146\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.902\nPerfect. And your brain knows\nexactly how to get it back.\n\n00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:49.174\nThe second interface guideline\nwe call \"touch to see.\"\n\n00:06:49.928 --> 00:06:54.258\nWhat do babies do when they see\nsomething that grabs their interest?\n\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.386\nThey try and reach out and touch it.\n\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.477\nAnd that's exactly how the natural\nmachine should work as well.\n\n00:07:00.397 --> 00:07:02.885\nTurns out the visual system\ngets a fundamental boost\n\n00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:05.318\nfrom a sense we call proprioception --\n\n00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.587\nthat's the sense\nof our body parts in space.\n\n00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.421\nSo by touching our work directly,\nwe're not only going to control it better,\n\n00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:14.023\nwe're also going to understand\nit much more deeply.\n\n00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:16.257\nHence, touch to see.\n\n00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:18.676\nBut it's not enough\nto experience things ourselves.\n\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.927\nWe're inherently these social primates.\n\n00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:23.063\nAnd this leads me to our third guideline,\n\n00:07:23.087 --> 00:07:25.884\nthe holographic campfire\nfrom our first story.\n\n00:07:26.495 --> 00:07:28.409\nOur mirror-neuron subsystem suggests\n\n00:07:28.433 --> 00:07:31.981\nthat we can connect with each other\nand with our work much better\n\n00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:34.990\nif we can see each other's\nfaces and hands in 3D.\n\n00:07:35.014 --> 00:07:36.851\nSo if you look at the video behind me,\n\n00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:41.184\nyou can see two Meta users\nplaying around with the same hologram,\n\n00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:43.923\nmaking eye contact,\nconnected around this thing,\n\n00:07:43.947 --> 00:07:46.638\ninstead of being distracted\nby external devices.\n\n00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:52.582\nLet's go ahead and try this again\nwith neuroscience in mind.\n\n00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:59.429\nSo again, our favorite interface,\nthe iOS of the mind.\n\n00:08:00.273 --> 00:08:02.184\nI'm going to now take a step further\n\n00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:04.958\nand go ahead and grab this pair of glasses\n\n00:08:04.982 --> 00:08:06.702\nand leave it right here by the desk.\n\n00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.448\nI'm now with you, I'm in the moment,\n\n00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:09.624\nwe're connecting.\n\n00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:12.566\nMy spatial memory kicks in,\nand I can go ahead and grab it\n\n00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.691\nand bring it right back here, reminding me\n\n00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:16.601\nthat I am the operating system.\n\n00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:19.005\nAnd now my proprioception is working,\n\n00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:22.825\nand I can go ahead and explode\nthese glasses into a thousand parts\n\n00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:27.239\nand touch the very sensor\nthat is currently scanning my hand.\n\n00:08:27.263 --> 00:08:29.224\nBut it's not enough to see things alone,\n\n00:08:29.248 --> 00:08:32.220\nso in a second, my co-founder Ray\nis going to make a 3D call --\n\n00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:33.402\nRay?\n\n00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:34.912\n(Ringing)\n\n00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:36.841\nHey Ray, how's it going?\n\n00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:40.293\nGuys, I can see this guy\nin front me in full 3D.\n\n00:08:40.317 --> 00:08:42.614\nAnd he is photo-realistic.\n\n00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:43.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.110\nThank you.\n\n00:08:45.134 --> 00:08:49.115\nMy mirror-neuron subsystem suggests\nthat this is going to replace phones\n\n00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:50.535\nin not too long.\n\n00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.377\nRay, how's it going?\n\n00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:54.766\nRay: Great.

I believe in law and order. I am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser. I believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities. I love my job and the people that do it. I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better.By a show of hands, how many of you, by the age of 25, had either acted up in school, went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of, or drank alcohol before your legal age?(Laughter)All right.How many of you shoplifted, tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight \u2014 yes, even with a sibling? Now, how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions? How many of you sitting here today think that you're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?(Laughter)Point taken.When we talk about criminal justice reform, we often focus on a few things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today. But first I'm going to \u2014 since you shared with me, I'm going to give you a confession on my part. I went to law school to make money. I had no interest in being a public servant, I had no interest in criminal law, and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court. I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston, plagued by gun violence and drug crime. My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship. I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only: \"Not guilty.\" They were predominately black and brown. And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input. They were predominately white. As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom, I couldn't stop but think: How did they get here? I wanted to know their stories. And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case, I was thinking to myself, we could have predicted that. That seems so preventable... not because I was an expert in criminal law, but because it was common sense.Over the course of the internship, I began to recognize people in the auditorium, not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any.My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney, and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder. Even in our \"worst,\" I saw human stories. And they all contained childhood trauma, victimization, poverty, loss, disengagement from school, early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system, all leading to a seat in a courtroom. Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison, and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years when we could have reinvested it up front, and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.(Applause)My third year of law school, I defended people accused of small street crimes, mostly mentally ill, mostly homeless, mostly drug-addicted, all in need of help. They would come to us, and we would send them away without that help. They were in need of our assistance. But we weren't giving them any. Prosecuted, adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them.The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work. The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender. The power dynamic that I came to understand made me become a prosecutor.I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem. We know the criminal justice system needs reform, we know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons, making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet. We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole, we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color, particularly poor people of color. And we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms. But what we do not discuss is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them. When we talk about criminal justice reform, we, as a society, focus on three things. We complain, we tweet, we protest about the police, about sentencing laws and about prison. We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.In the fall of 2009, a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department. He was 18 years old, he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school. He had his sights set on college but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school. In a series of bad decisions, he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet. This led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges. The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most. But what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future.I was standing in arraignments that day when Christopher's case came across my desk. And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment, I had Christopher's life in my hands. I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor, and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christopher's life. Christopher's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such, but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer.For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions, regardless of our intent. Despite our broad discretion, we learn to avoid risk at all cost, rendering our discretion basically useless. History has conditioned us to believe that somehow, the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety, despite evidence to the contrary. We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins, so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative at our case dispositions, or to take risks on people we might not otherwise. We stick to an outdated method, counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want, and that's safer communities.Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher. They have little appreciation for what we can do. Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record, making it harder for him to get a job, setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today. With a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing. Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime. The more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system, the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again \u2014 all at tremendous social cost to his children, to his family and to his peers. And, ladies and gentlemen, it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us.When I came out of law school, I did the same thing as everybody else. I came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice, but I never learned what justice was in my classes \u2014 none of us do. None of us do.And yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system. Our power is virtually boundless. In most cases, not the judge, not the police, not the legislature, not the mayor, not the governor, not the President can tell us how to prosecute our cases. The decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record was exclusively mine. I would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony, for a misdemeanor, or at all. I would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial, and ultimately, I would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail. These are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered, and we are unaware and untrained of the grave consequences of those decisions.One night this past summer, I was at a small gathering of professional men of color from around the city. As I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth, as you do as public servant \u2014(Laughter)I noticed across the room, a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me. And I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where, and before I knew it, this young man was hugging me. And thanking me. \"You cared about me, and you changed my life.\" It was Christopher.See, I never arraigned Christopher. He never faced a judge or a jail, he never had a criminal record. Instead, I worked with Christopher; first on being accountable for his actions, and then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend. We recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to Best Buy, and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we couldn't recover. Christopher did community service. He wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community. He applied to college, he obtained financial aid, and he went on to graduate from a four-year school.(Applause)After we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag, to learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston. Christopher had accomplished \u2014 and making a lot more money than me \u2014(Laughter)He had accomplished all of this in the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court. I can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success, but I certainly did my part to keep him on the path.There are thousands of Christophers out there, some locked in our jails and prisons. We need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that and to protect them. An employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one. It's a bigger win for all of us. In retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher makes perfect sense. When I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court, I didn't see a criminal standing there. I saw myself \u2014 a young person in need of intervention. As an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens, I knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system. Along the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney, my supervisor and judges, I learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ruining them.And that's how we do it in Boston. We helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids get a job. Instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail for punching another teenager, we secured mental health treatment and community supervision. A runaway girl who was arrested for prostituting, to survive on the streets, needed a safe place to live and grow \u2014 something we could help her with. I even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school, that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack, he put a loaded 9-millimeter. We would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented.Which is the better way to spend our time? How would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs? Why are we spending 80 billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing, when we could take that money and reallocate it into education, into mental health treatment, into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?(Applause)So why should this matter to you? Well, one, we're spending a lot of money. Our money. It costs 109,000 dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year, with a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system. That is a terrible return on investment.Number two: it's the right thing to do. If prosecutors were a part of creating the problem, it's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us.And number three: your voice and your vote can make that happen. The next time there's a local district attorney's election in your jurisdiction, ask candidates these questions. One: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer? Two: What data are you collecting, and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it's working? And number three: If it's not working for everybody, what are you doing to fix it? If they can't answer the questions, they shouldn't be doing the job.Each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity, of intervention, of support and of love. While each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever malfeasances you committed, barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today \u2014 some of the greatest minds on the planet.Every day, thousands of times a day, prosecutors around the United States wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring about opportunity, intervention, support and yes, even love. Those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community, and a strong community is a safe one. If our communities are broken, don't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated, inefficient, expensive methods.Demand more; vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail, not putting them in.Demand better. You deserve it, your children deserve it, the people who are tied up in the system deserve it, but most of all, the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it.We must, we must do better.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you very much.", "id": 2453, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:14.620\nThe following

00:02:06.855\nin the Roxbury Division\nof Boston Municipal Court.\n\n00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:10.399\nI knew of Roxbury as an impoverished\nneighborhood in Boston,\n\n00:02:10.423 -->

00:06:09.723\nhe stole 30 laptops from a store\nand sold them on the Internet.\n\n00:06:10.382 --> 00:06:11.871\nThis led to his arrest\n\n00:06:11.895 --> 00:06:16.151\nand a criminal complaint\nof 30 felony charges.\n\n00:06:17.635 --> 00:06:21.183\nThe potential jail time he faced is what\nstressed Christopher out the most.\n\n00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:23.301\nBut what he had little understanding of\n\n00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:26.635\nwas the impact a criminal record\nwould have on his future.\n\n00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:30.162\nI was standing in arraignments that day\n\n00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:32.282\nwhen Christopher's case\ncame across my desk.\n\n00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:34.822\nAnd at the risk of sounding\ndramatic, in that moment,\n\n00:06:34.846 --> 00:06:36.797\nI had Christopher's life in my hands.\n\n00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.714\nI was 29 years old,\na brand-new prosecutor,\n\n00:06:39.738 --> 00:06:42.834\nand I had little appreciation\nfor how the decisions I would make\n\n00:06:42.858 --> 00:06:45.444\nwould impact Christopher's life.\n\n00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:48.680\nChristopher's case was a serious one\n\n00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:50.585\nand it needed to be dealt with as such,\n\n00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:53.648\nbut I didn't think branding him\na felon for the rest of his life\n\n00:06:53.672 --> 00:06:54.830\nwas the right answer.\n\n00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:58.621\nFor the most part,\nprosecutors step onto the job\n\n00:06:58.645 --> 00:07:01.296\nwith little appreciation\nof the impact of our decisions,\n\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.629\nregardless of our intent.\n\n00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:04.168\nDespite our broad discretion,\n\n00:07:04.192 --> 00:07:07.364\nwe learn to avoid risk at all cost,\n\n00:07:07.388 --> 00:07:09.126\nrendering our discretion\n\n00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.434\nbasically useless.\n\n00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:14.321\nHistory has conditioned us\nto believe that somehow,\n\n00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:17.132\nthe criminal justice system\nbrings about accountability\n\n00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:18.486\nand improves public safety,\n\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.217\ndespite evidence to the contrary.\n\n00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:24.702\nWe're judged internally and externally\nby our convictions and our trial wins,\n\n00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:28.224\nso prosecutors aren't really\nincentivized to be creative\n\n00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:30.355\nat our case dispositions,\n\n00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:33.526\nor to take risks on people\nwe might not otherwise.\n\n00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:36.121\nWe stick to an outdated method,\n\n00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:39.276\ncounterproductive to achieving\nthe very goal that we all want,\n\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.255\nand that's safer communities.\n\n00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.773\nYet most prosecutors standing in my space\nwould have arraigned Christopher.\n\n00:07:46.855 --> 00:07:50.233\nThey have little appreciation\nfor what we can do.\n\n00:07:50.257 --> 00:07:53.367\nArraigning Christopher\nwould give him a criminal record,\n\n00:07:54.384 --> 00:07:56.494\nmaking it harder for him to get a job,\n\n00:07:56.978 --> 00:07:58.667\nsetting in motion a cycle\n\n00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:01.547\nthat defines the failing\ncriminal justice system today.\n\n00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:06.016\nWith a criminal record and without a job,\n\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.561\nChristopher would be unable to find\nemployment, education or stable housing.\n\n00:08:10.585 --> 00:08:12.704\nWithout those protective\nfactors in his life,\n\n00:08:12.728 --> 00:08:16.098\nChristopher would be more likely\nto commit further, more serious crime.\n\n00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:19.247\nThe more contact Christopher had\nwith the criminal justice system,\n\n00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.815\nthe more likely it would be\nthat he would return again\n\n00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.808\nand again and again --\n\n00:08:23.832 --> 00:08:27.636\nall at tremendous social cost\nto his children, to his family\n\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.811\nand to his peers.\n\n00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:30.140\nAnd, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n00:08:30.164 --> 00:08:33.639\nit is a terrible public safety\noutcome for the rest of us.\n\n00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:38.742\nWhen I came out of law school,\n\n00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:40.972\nI did the same thing as everybody else.\n\n00:08:41.504 --> 00:08:43.960\nI came out as a prosecutor\nexpected to do justice,\n\n00:08:43.984 --> 00:08:46.487\nbut I never learned what\njustice was in my classes --\n\n00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:47.661\nnone of us do.\n\n00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:49.311\nNone of us do.\n\n00:08:50.918 --> 00:08:53.405\nAnd yet, prosecutors\nare the most powerful actors\n\n00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:55.039\nin the criminal justice system.\n\n00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:57.880\nOur power is virtually boundless.\n\n00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.357\nIn most cases, not the judge,\n\n00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:01.111\nnot the police, not the legislature,\n\n00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:03.508\nnot the mayor, not the governor,\nnot the President\n\n00:09:03.532 --> 00:09:05.468\ncan tell us how to prosecute our cases.\n\n00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:10.080\nThe decision to arraign Christopher\nand give him a criminal record\n\n00:09:10.104 --> 00:09:11.333\nwas exclusively mine.\n\n00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.787\nI would choose whether to prosecute\nhim for 30 felonies, for one felony,\n\n00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:16.962\nfor a misdemeanor,\n\n00:09:16.986 --> 00:09:18.163\nor at all.\n\n00:09:18.187 --> 00:09:21.163\nI would choose whether to leverage\nChristopher into a plea deal\n\n00:09:21.187 --> 00:09:23.216\nor take the case to trial, and ultimately,\n\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.231\nI would be in a position to ask\nfor Christopher to go to jail.\n\n00:09:27.878 --> 00:09:31.547\nThese are decisions that prosecutors\nmake every day unfettered,\n\n00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.380\nand we are unaware and untrained\n\n00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:38.318\nof the grave consequences\nof those decisions.\n\n00:09:40.456 --> 00:09:41.778\nOne night this past summer,\n\n00:09:41.802 --> 00:09:45.704\nI was at a small gathering\nof professional men of color\n\n00:09:45.728 --> 00:09:47.315\nfrom around the city.\n\n00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:50.296\nAs I stood there stuffing\nfree finger sandwiches into my mouth,\n\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.803\nas you do as public servant --\n\n00:09:51.827 --> 00:09:52.843\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:54.430\nI noticed across the room,\n\n00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:58.253\na young man waving and smiling\nat me and approaching me.\n\n00:09:59.485 --> 00:10:02.509\nAnd I recognized him,\nbut I couldn't place from where,\n\n00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:06.121\nand before I knew it,\nthis young man was hugging me.\n\n00:10:07.092 --> 00:10:08.479\nAnd thanking me.\n\n00:10:09.724 --> 00:10:12.025\n\"You cared about me,\nand you changed my life.\"\n\n00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:14.787\nIt was Christopher.\n\n00:10:15.794 --> 00:10:17.480\nSee, I never arraigned Christopher.\n\n00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:19.104\nHe never faced a judge or a jail,\n\n00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:20.707\nhe never had a criminal record.\n\n00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:22.849\nInstead, I worked with Christopher;\n\n00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:25.592\nfirst on being accountable\nfor his actions,\n\n00:10:25.616 --> 00:10:28.705\nand then, putting him in a position\nwhere he wouldn't re-offend.\n\n00:10:29.623 --> 00:10:32.576\nWe recovered 75 percent\nof the computers that he sold\n\n00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.103\nand gave them back to Best Buy,\n\n00:10:34.127 --> 00:10:35.731\nand came up with a financial plan\n\n00:10:35.755 --> 00:10:37.970\nto repay for the computers\nwe couldn't recover.\n\n00:10:37.994 --> 00:10:39.709\nChristopher did community service.\n\n00:10:39.733 --> 00:10:43.012\nHe wrote an essay reflecting on how\nthis case could impact his future\n\n00:10:43.036 --> 00:10:44.387\nand that of the community.\n\n00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:45.618\nHe applied to college,\n\n00:10:45.642 --> 00:10:46.902\nhe obtained financial aid,\n\n00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:49.487\nand he went on to graduate\nfrom a four-year school.\n\n00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:56.965\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.972\nAfter we finished hugging,\nI looked at his name tag,\n\n00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:03.245\nto learn that Christopher was the manager\nof a large bank in Boston.\n\n00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:06.569\nChristopher had accomplished --\nand making a lot more money than me --\n\n00:11:06.593 --> 00:11:07.594\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:07.618 --> 00:11:09.124\nHe had accomplished all of this\n\n00:11:09.148 --> 00:11:12.243\nin the six years since I had first\nseen him in Roxbury Court.\n\n00:11:12.867 --> 00:11:15.934\nI can't take credit for Christopher's\njourney to success,\n\n00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:19.847\nbut I certainly did my part\nto keep him on the path.\n\n00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.029\nThere are thousands\nof Christophers out there,\n\n00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.332\nsome locked in our jails and prisons.\n\n00:11:26.356 --> 00:11:28.221\nWe need thousands of prosecutors\n\n00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:31.069\nto recognize that and to protect them.\n\n00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:35.982\nAn employed Christopher is better\nfor public safety than a condemned one.\n\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.063\nIt's a bigger win for all of us.\n\n00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:43.477\nIn retrospect, the decision not\nto throw the book at Christopher\n\n00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:44.652\nmakes perfect sense.\n\n00:11:44.676 --> 00:11:46.888\nWhen I saw him that first day\nin Roxbury Court,\n\n00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:48.784\nI didn't see a criminal standing there.\n\n00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.603\nI saw myself -- a young person\nin need of intervention.\n\n00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:55.940\nAs an individual caught selling a large\nquantity of drugs in my late teens,\n\n00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:58.889\nI knew firsthand the power of opportunity\n\n00:11:58.913 --> 00:12:01.799\nas opposed to the wrath\nof the criminal justice system.\n\n00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:08.210\nAlong the way, with the help\nand guidance of my district attorney,\n\n00:12:08.234 --> 00:12:11.207\nmy supervisor and judges,\n\n00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.758\nI learned the power of the prosecutor\n\n00:12:13.782 --> 00:12:16.504\nto change lives instead of ruining them.\n\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.137\nAnd that's how we do it in Boston.\n\n00:12:21.164 --> 00:12:24.709\nWe helped a woman who was arrested\nfor stealing groceries to feed her kids\n\n00:12:24.733 --> 00:12:25.883\nget a job.\n\n00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:29.507\nInstead of putting an abused\nteenager in adult jail\n\n00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:30.984\nfor punching another teenager,\n\n00:12:31.008 --> 00:12:33.898\nwe secured mental health treatment\nand community supervision.\n\n00:12:34.246 --> 00:12:35.893\nA runaway girl who was arrested\n\n00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:38.020\nfor prostituting, to survive\non the streets,\n\n00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:40.785\nneeded a safe place to live and grow --\n\n00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:42.812\nsomething we could help her with.\n\n00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:44.312\nI even helped a young man\n\n00:12:44.336 --> 00:12:47.439\nwho was so afraid of the older gang kids\nshowing up after school,\n\n00:12:47.463 --> 00:12:50.138\nthat one morning instead\nof a lunchbox into his backpack,\n\n00:12:50.162 --> 00:12:51.787\nhe put a loaded 9-millimeter.\n\n00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:57.461\nWe would spend our time that we'd\nnormally take prepping our cases\n\n00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.652\nfor months and months\nfor trial down the road\n\n00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:03.577\nby coming up with real solutions\nto the problems as they presented.\n\n00:13:04.657 --> 00:13:06.943\nWhich is the better way to spend our time?\n\n00:13:07.927 --> 00:13:10.661\nHow would you prefer\nyour prosecutors to spend theirs?\n\n00:13:11.859 --> 00:13:14.227\nWhy are we spending 80 billion dollars\n\n00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:16.693\non a prison industry\nthat we know is failing,\n\n00:13:16.717 --> 00:13:20.281\nwhen we could take that money\nand reallocate it into education,\n\n00:13:20.305 --> 00:13:21.714\ninto mental health treatment,\n\n00:13:21.738 --> 00:13:23.235\ninto substance abuse treatment\n\n00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:26.317\nand to community investment\nso we can develop our neighborhoods?\n\n00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:32.857\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:33.574 --> 00:13:35.178\nSo why should this matter to you?\n\n00:13:35.202 --> 00:13:38.320\nWell, one, we're spending a lot of money.\n\n00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:40.489\nOur money.\n\n00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:43.427\nIt costs 109,000 dollars in some states\n\n00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:45.041\nto lock up a teenager for a year,\n\n00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:49.517\nwith a 60 percent chance that that person\nwill return to the very same system.\n\n00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:52.964\nThat is a terrible return on investment.\n\n00:13:54.664 --> 00:13:56.938\nNumber two: it's the right thing to do.\n\n00:13:56.962 --> 00:13:59.917\nIf prosecutors were a part\nof creating the problem,\n\n00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:02.170\nit's incumbent on us to create a solution\n\n00:14:02.194 --> 00:14:04.241\nand we can do that using other disciplines\n\n00:14:04.265 --> 00:14:06.781\nthat have already done the data\nand research for us.\n\n00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:07.974\nAnd number three:\n\n00:14:07.998 --> 00:14:10.599\nyour voice and your vote\ncan make that happen.\n\n00:14:10.623 --> 00:14:13.303\nThe next time there's a local\ndistrict attorney's election\n\n00:14:13.327 --> 00:14:14.479\nin your jurisdiction,\n\n00:14:14.503 --> 00:14:15.997\nask candidates these questions.\n\n00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:19.208\nOne: What are you doing to make\nme and my neighbors safer?\n\n00:14:19.232 --> 00:14:21.612\nTwo: What data are you collecting,\n\n00:14:21.636 --> 00:14:23.857\nand how are you training your prosecutors\n\n00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:25.552\nto make sure that it's working?\n\n00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:26.741\nAnd number three:\n\n00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:28.621\nIf it's not working for everybody,\n\n00:14:28.645 --> 00:14:30.199\nwhat are you doing to fix it?\n\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.232\nIf they can't answer the questions,\n\n00:14:32.256 --> 00:14:34.143\nthey shouldn't be doing the job.\n\n00:14:35.438 --> 00:14:38.655\nEach one of you that raised your hand\nat the beginning of this talk\n\n00:14:38.679 -->

returning to work after a career break: I call them relaunchers. These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care, for childcare reasons, pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue. Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds: veterans, military spouses, retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats. Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers. Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition, and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers, especially if they've been out for a long time. This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve.Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field. This is Sami Kafala. He's a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children. The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks. And speaking of long career breaks, this is Mimi Kahn. She's a social worker in Orange County, California, who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break. That's the longest career break that I'm aware of. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took a five-year career break early in her career.And this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break. Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it. Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home, but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work, plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working. Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search. She was looking for a finance or accounting role, and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results.I met Tracy in June of 2011, when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around. The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house. I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. I also told her, \"You are going to have a lot of conversations that don't go anywhere. Expect that, and don't be discouraged by it. There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity.\"I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit, but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce. And that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time. What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past, the people with whom you worked or went to school, they are going to remember you as you were before your career break. And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time, as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities. So for example, you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this. This is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan. Or here I am in the kitchen. But those people from the past, they don't know about any of this. They only remember you as you were, and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work.There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break. And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news. My background is in finance, and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children. So I was afraid I'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore. So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again.I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce, and here's why. Think about our life stage: for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons, we have fewer or no maternity leaves. We did that already. We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations. We're in a more settled time of life. We have great work experience. We have a more mature perspective. We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense. Plus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we've been away from it for a while.On the flip side, I speak with employers, and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers.The first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete. Now, I can tell you, having been technologically obsolete myself at one point, that it's a temporary condition. I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3. I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far, but I had to relearn it on Excel. It actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same. I found PowerPoint much more challenging, but now I use PowerPoint all the time. I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software. And if they're not up to speed, then it's their responsibility to get there. And they do.The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do. I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break. That's not the employer's job. It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value.Back in 2010 I started noticing something. I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008, and in 2010, I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity, whether it was called an internship or not, but an internship-like experience, as a way for professionals to return to work. I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs. I saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate, apply for an entry-level internship program in the military, and then get a permanent job afterward. I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs.So I wrote a report about what I was seeing, and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called \"The 40-Year-Old Intern.\" I have to thank the editors there for that title, and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns. And then, courtesy of Fox Business News, they called the concept \"The 50-Year-Old Intern.\"(Laughter)So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals. And at this point, hundreds of people have participated. These internships are paid, and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries. And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers. Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship? Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews, and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over. This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers, and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires.Think about how far we have come. Before this, most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all. But now, not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind, but you can't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.This is the mark of real change, of true institutional shift, because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers, we can solve it for other career transitioners too. In fact, an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program. And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program. Different pool, same concept.So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro. Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department. But it was a temp job. The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more, but no guarantees. This was in the fall of 2011. Tracy loved this company, and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house. So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role, she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best. Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012, but they made it even more interesting and challenging, because they knew what Tracy could handle.Fast forward to 2015, Tracy's been promoted. They've paid for her to get her MBA at night. She's even hired another relauncher to work for her. Tracy's temp job was a tryout, just like an internship, and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers. But in the meantime, if you are returning to work after a career break, don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program. Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2469, "subtitle":

ourselves\nat an employer's expense.\n\n00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:27.854\nPlus we have an energy,\nan enthusiasm about returning to work\n\n00:05:27.878 --> 00:05:30.798\nprecisely because we've been\naway from it for a while.\n\n00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:34.174\nOn the flip side, I speak with employers,\n\n00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:36.734\nand here are two concerns\nthat employers have\n\n00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:38.654\nabout hiring relaunchers.\n\n00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:41.734\nThe first one is, employers\nare worried that relaunchers\n\n00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.798\nare technologically obsolete.\n\n00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:45.614\nNow, I can tell you,\n\n00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:49.214\nhaving been technologically\nobsolete myself at one point,\n\n00:05:49.238 --> 00:05:50.918\nthat it's a temporary condition.\n\n00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:57.614\nI had done my financial analysis\nso long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.\n\n00:05:57.638 --> 00:06:00.574\nI don't know if anyone\ncan even remember back that far,\n\n00:06:00.598 --> 00:06:02.814\nbut I had to relearn it on Excel.\n\n00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:05.918\nIt actually wasn't that hard.\nA lot of the commands are the same.\n\n00:06:06.558 --> 00:06:08.774\nI found PowerPoint much more challenging,\n\n00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:10.958\nbut now I use PowerPoint all the time.\n\n00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:16.574\nI tell relaunchers that employers\nexpect them to come to the table\n\n00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:20.094\nwith a working knowledge\nof basic office management software.\n\n00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:21.854\nAnd if they're not up to speed,\n\n00:06:21.878 --> 00:06:24.254\nthen it's their\nresponsibility to get there.\n\n00:06:24.278 --> 00:06:25.478\nAnd they do.\n\n00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.534\nThe second area of concern\nthat employers have about relaunchers\n\n00:06:29.558 --> 00:06:32.758\nis they're worried that relaunchers\ndon't know what they want to do.\n\n00:06:33.398 --> 00:06:36.614\nI tell relaunchers that they need\nto do the hard work\n\n00:06:36.638 --> 00:06:40.134\nto figure out whether their interests\nand skills have changed\n\n00:06:40.158 --> 00:06:41.734\nor have not changed\n\n00:06:41.758 --> 00:06:43.574\nwhile they have been on career break.\n\n00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:45.854\nThat's not the employer's job.\n\n00:06:45.878 --> 00:06:50.454\nIt's the relauncher's responsibility\nto demonstrate to the employer\n\n00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:52.398\nwhere they can add the most value.\n\n00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:57.798\nBack in 2010 I started noticing something.\n\n00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:02.494\nI had been tracking\nreturn to work programs since 2008,\n\n00:07:02.518 --> 00:07:05.814\nand in 2010, I started noticing\n\n00:07:05.838 --> 00:07:09.734\nthe use of a short-term\npaid work opportunity,\n\n00:07:09.758 --> 00:07:12.214\nwhether it was called\nan internship or not,\n\n00:07:12.238 --> 00:07:14.574\nbut an internship-like experience,\n\n00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:17.734\nas a way for professionals\nto return to work.\n\n00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:20.534\nI saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee\n\n00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:23.854\nstart corporate reentry\ninternship programs.\n\n00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:28.318\nI saw a returning engineer,\na nontraditional reentry candidate,\n\n00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:32.894\napply for an entry-level\ninternship program in the military,\n\n00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:35.278\nand then get a permanent job afterward.\n\n00:07:35.838 --> 00:07:39.534\nI saw two universities\nintegrate internships\n\n00:07:39.558 --> 00:07:42.598\ninto mid-career executive\neducation programs.\n\n00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:45.974\nSo I wrote a report\nabout what I was seeing,\n\n00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.974\nand it became this article\nfor Harvard Business Review\n\n00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:50.894\ncalled \"The 40-Year-Old Intern.\"\n\n00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:53.534\nI have to thank the editors\nthere for that title,\n\n00:07:53.558 --> 00:07:54.934\nand also for this artwork\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:59.294\nwhere you can see the 40-year-old intern\nin the midst of all the college interns.\n\n00:07:59.318 --> 00:08:02.494\nAnd then, courtesy of Fox Business News,\n\n00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:05.694\nthey called the concept\n\"The 50-Year-Old Intern.\"\n\n00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:09.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:13.414\nSo five of the biggest\nfinancial services companies\n\n00:08:13.438 --> 00:08:17.574\nhave reentry internship programs\nfor returning finance professionals.\n\n00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:20.894\nAnd at this point,\nhundreds of people have participated.\n\n00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:22.694\nThese internships are paid,\n\n00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:25.454\nand the people who move on\nto permanent roles\n\n00:08:25.478 --> 00:08:28.158\nare commanding competitive salaries.\n\n00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:32.094\nAnd now, seven of the biggest\nengineering companies\n\n00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:36.414\nare piloting reentry internship programs\nfor returning engineers\n\n00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:40.158\nas part of an initiative\nwith the Society of Women Engineers.\n\n00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:45.358\nNow, why are companies embracing\nthe reentry internship?\n\n00:08:46.398 --> 00:08:49.374\nBecause the internship allows the employer\n\n00:08:49.398 --> 00:08:53.414\nto base their hiring decision\non an actual work sample\n\n00:08:53.438 --> 00:08:55.493\ninstead of a series of interviews,\n\n00:08:55.517 --> 00:08:59.254\nand the employer does not have to make\nthat permanent hiring decision\n\n00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:02.078\nuntil the internship period is over.\n\n00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:06.494\nThis testing out period\nremoves the perceived risk\n\n00:09:06.518 --> 00:09:10.094\nthat some managers attach\nto hiring relaunchers,\n\n00:09:10.118 --> 00:09:12.774\nand they are attracting\nexcellent candidates\n\n00:09:12.798 --> 00:09:14.638\nwho are turning into great hires.\n\n00:09:15.198 --> 00:09:17.158\nThink about how far we have come.\n\n00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:20.494\nBefore this, most employers\nwere not interested\n\n00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.854\nin engaging with relaunchers at all.\n\n00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:26.374\nBut now, not only\nare programs being developed\n\n00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:28.934\nspecifically with relaunchers in mind,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.454\nbut you can't even apply\nfor these programs\n\n00:09:31.478 --> 00:09:34.158\nunless you have a gap on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:36.894\nThis is the mark of real change,\n\n00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:39.174\nof true institutional shift,\n\n00:09:39.198 --> 00:09:42.734\nbecause if we can solve\nthis problem for relaunchers,\n\n00:09:42.758 --> 00:09:46.054\nwe can solve it for other\ncareer transitioners too.\n\n00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:48.014\nIn fact, an employer just told me\n\n00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:50.534\nthat their veterans return to work program\n\n00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:53.934\nis based on their reentry\ninternship program.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:58.974\nAnd there's no reason why there can't be\na retiree internship program.\n\n00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:01.478\nDifferent pool, same concept.\n\n00:10:02.358 --> 00:10:04.814\nSo let me tell you\nwhat happened with Tracy Shapiro.\n\n00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:07.414\nRemember that she had to tell\neveryone she knew\n\n00:10:07.438 --> 00:10:09.438\nabout her interest in returning to work.\n\n00:10:09.758 --> 00:10:13.934\nWell, one critical conversation\nwith another parent in her community\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.054\nled to a job offer for Tracy,\n\n00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:18.854\nand it was an accounting job\nin a finance department.\n\n00:10:18.878 --> 00:10:20.198\nBut it was a temp job.\n\n00:10:20.758 --> 00:10:23.214\nThe company told her\nthere was a possibility\n\n00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:26.774\nit could turn into something more,\nbut no guarantees.\n\n00:10:26.798 --> 00:10:29.158\nThis was in the fall of 2011.\n\n00:10:29.678 --> 00:10:32.694\nTracy loved this company,\nand she loved the people\n\n00:10:32.718 --> 00:10:35.774\nand the office was less\nthan 10 minutes from her house.\n\n00:10:35.798 --> 00:10:38.014\nSo even though she had a second job offer\n\n00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:40.934\nat another company\nfor a permanent full-time role,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.174\nshe decided to take her chances\nwith this internship\n\n00:10:44.198 --> 00:10:45.958\nand hope for the best.\n\n00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:50.334\nWell, she ended up blowing away\nall of their expectations,\n\n00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.854\nand the company not only\nmade her a permanent offer\n\n00:10:52.878 --> 00:10:54.974\nat the beginning of 2012,\n\n00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:57.614\nbut they made it even more\ninteresting and challenging,\n\n00:10:57.638 --> 00:10:59.758\nbecause they knew what Tracy could handle.\n\n00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:02.814\nFast forward to 2015,\n\n00:11:02.838 --> 00:11:04.414\nTracy's been promoted.\n\n00:11:04.438 --> 00:11:06.854\nThey've paid for her\nto get her MBA at night.\n\n00:11:06.878 --> 00:11:10.198\nShe's even hired another relauncher\nto work for her.\n\n00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:15.174\nTracy's temp job was a tryout,\n\n00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:16.854\njust like an internship,\n\n00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:22.118\nand it ended up being a win\nfor both Tracy and her employer.\n\n00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:27.934\nNow, my goal is to bring\nthe reentry internship concept\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.694\nto more and more employers.\n\n00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:32.534\nBut in the meantime,\n\n00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:35.774\nif you are returning to work\nafter a career break,\n\n00:11:35.798 --> 00:11:41.814\ndon't hesitate to suggest an internship\nor an internship-like arrangement\n\n00:11:41.838 --> 00:11:47.454\nto an employer that does not have\na formal reentry internship program.\n\n00:11:47.478 --> 00:11:49.774\nBe their first success story,\n\n00:11:49.798 --> 00:11:53.438\nand you can be the example\nfor more relaunchers to come.\n\n00:11:53.878 --> 00:11:55.094\nThank you.\n\n00:11:55.118 --> 00:12:00.283\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "You have no idea where camels really come from", "duration": "747", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/latif_nasser_you_have_no_idea_where_camels_really_come_from", "transcript": "So, this is a story about how we know what we know.It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybczynski. She's a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me \"Dr. Dead Things.\"Latif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up, way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.Now, one summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.(Audio) NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting, because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.LN: And at some point, she noticed something.(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored, about the size of the palm of my hand. It was just lying on the surface.LN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood, because that's the sort of thing people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before \u2014 prehistoric plant parts. But that night, back at camp ...(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens, I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings. Maybe it's a preservation thing, but it looks really like ... bone.LN: Huh. So over the next four years, she went to that spot over and over, and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone, most of them really tiny.(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Ziploc bag.LN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle. But it was challenging.(Audio) NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces, I'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good. So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.LN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?(Laughter)LN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.LN: How certain were you that you had it right, that you had put it together in the right way? Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way and have, like, a parakeet or something?(Laughter)(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this.LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep. But it couldn't have been either of those. It was just too big.(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, it was huge. It's a really big animal.LN: So what animal could it be? Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado, and they had an idea.(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it, and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh. It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab: collagen. Collagen is what gives structure to our bones. And usually, after so many years, it breaks down. But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called \"collagen fingerprinting.\" It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen, so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a match.So she shipped him one of the fragments, FedEx.(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.(Laughter)LN: And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species. And he found a match. It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ... a camel.(Laughter)(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing \u2014 if it's true.LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments, and they got the same result for each one. However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels. So this camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton.(Audience reacts)Yeah. Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.(Laughter)Now, when you hear the word \"camel,\" what may come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia. But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these, the dromedary, quintessential desert creature \u2014 hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara, has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks, has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes. So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are actually originally American.(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)(Laughter)They started here. For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes. You'll have some with really long necks, so they're actually functionally like giraffes.LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.(Audio) NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits.LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?(Audio) NR: The earliest ones. So those ones you probably would not recognize.LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.(Audio) NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?(Laughter)LN: And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa. And then around the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north. Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara. Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now. So it would have been boreal forest, so more like the Yukon or Siberia today. But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over. You'd have blizzards. You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness. Like, how ... How? How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions?(Laughter)Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer. And it's kind of brilliant. What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it get through the winter? What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes? What if that hump \u2014 which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat \u2014(Laughter)was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce? And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment? Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body. So it helps heat dissipate easier. It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story. Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change. But I love it for a totally different reason. For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes.So I was trained as a historian. And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too. They make sense of the past. They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet. And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.(Audio) NR: We make up stories and we stick with it, like the camel in the desert, right? That's a great story! It's totally adapted for that. Clearly, it always lived there.LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence. You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew. Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature looks the way it does. And for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel. It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment, to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara, and could end up virtually anywhere.(Applause)This is Azuri. Azuri, hi, how are you doing? OK, here, I've got one of these for you here.(Laughter)So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig at the Radio City Music Hall.(Laughter)That's not even a joke. Anyway \u2014But really, Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one. It requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.(Laughter)Right, Azuri?And, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2455, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.838 --> 00:00:14.838\nSo, this is a story\n\n00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:16.791\nabout how we know what we know.\n\n00:00:17.648 --> 00:00:19.783\nIt's a story about this woman,\n\n00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:22.505\nNatalia Rybczynski.\n\n00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.918\nShe's a paleobiologist,\n\n00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:28.771\nwhich means she specializes\nin digging up really old dead stuff.\n\n00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.297\n(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah,\nI had someone call me \"Dr. Dead Things.\"\n\n00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.950\nLatif Nasser: And I think\nshe's particularly interesting\n\n00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:36.888\nbecause of where she digs that stuff up,\n\n00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:41.107\nway above the Arctic Circle\nin the remote Canadian tundra.\n\n00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.914\nNow, one summer day in 2006,\n\n00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:48.129\nshe was at a dig site called\nthe Fyles Leaf Bed,\n\n00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:52.731\nwhich is less than 10 degrees latitude\naway from the magnetic north pole.\n\n00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:55.482\n(Audio) NR: Really, it's not\ngoing to sound very exciting,\n\n00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:59.536\nbecause it was a day of walking\nwith your backpack and your GPS\n\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.638\nand notebook and just picking up\nanything that might be a fossil.\n\n00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:06.337\nLN: And at some point,\nshe noticed something.\n\n00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:08.528\n(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,\n\n00:01:08.552 --> 00:01:10.487\nabout the size of the palm of my hand.\n\n00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.805\nIt was just lying on the surface.\n\n00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.281\nLN: And at first she thought\nit was just a splinter of wood,\n\n00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.598\nbecause that's the sort of thing\npeople had found\n\n00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:22.041\nat the Fyles Leaf Bed before --\nprehistoric plant parts.\n\n00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:24.533\nBut that night, back at camp ...\n\n00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:26.827\n(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,\n\n00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:29.248\nI'm looking a little bit\nmore closely and realizing\n\n00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.676\nit doesn't quite look\nlike this has tree rings.\n\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.264\nMaybe it's a preservation thing,\n\n00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:35.562\nbut it looks really like ...\n\n00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:36.787\nbone.\n\n00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.700\nLN: Huh. So over the next four years,\n\n00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:42.658\nshe went to that spot over and over,\n\n00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:48.218\nand eventually collected 30 fragments\nof that exact same bone,\n\n00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:49.903\nmost of them really tiny.\n\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.916\n(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot.\nIt fits in a small Ziploc bag.\n\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.297\nLN: And she tried to piece them\ntogether like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\n00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.344\nBut it was challenging.\n\n00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:03.188\n(Audio) NR: It's broken up\ninto so many little tiny pieces,\n\n00:02:03.212 --> 00:02:07.470\nI'm trying to use sand and putty,\nand it's not looking good.\n\n00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:12.661\nSo finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.\n\n00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:14.274\nLN: Ooh!\nNR: Yeah, right?\n\n00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:15.738\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:18.505\nLN: It turns out it was way easier\nto do it virtually.\n\n00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.299\n(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical\nwhen it all fits together.\n\n00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:23.522\nLN: How certain were you\nthat you had it right,\n\n00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:25.691\nthat you had put it together\nin the right way?\n\n00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.729\nWas there a potential that you'd\nput it together a different way\n\n00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:30.695\nand have, like, a parakeet or something?\n\n00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.084\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:35.748\n(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no.\nNo, we got this.\n\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.041\nLN: What she had, she discovered,\nwas a tibia, a leg bone,\n\n00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:44.065\nand specifically, one that belonged\nto a cloven-hoofed mammal,\n\n00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.938\nso something like a cow or a sheep.\n\n00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:49.422\nBut it couldn't have been either of those.\n\n00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.229\nIt was just too big.\n\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.844\n(Audio) NR: The size of this thing,\nit was huge. It's a really big animal.\n\n00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:58.726\nLN: So what animal could it be?\n\n00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.829\nHaving hit a wall, she showed\none of the fragments\n\n00:03:01.853 --> 00:03:04.425\nto some colleagues of hers in Colorado,\n\n00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.709\nand they had an idea.\n\n00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:11.249\n(Audio) NR: We took a saw,\nand we nicked just the edge of it,\n\n00:03:11.273 --> 00:03:17.664\nand there was this really interesting\nsmell that comes from it.\n\n00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.242\nLN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.\n\n00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:23.899\nIt was a smell that Natalia recognized\n\n00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:27.866\nfrom cutting up skulls\nin her gross anatomy lab:\n\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.054\ncollagen.\n\n00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:31.735\nCollagen is what gives\nstructure to our bones.\n\n00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.917\nAnd usually, after so many years,\n\n00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.092\nit breaks down.\n\n00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:39.464\nBut in this case, the Arctic had acted\nlike a natural freezer and preserved it.\n\n00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:43.771\nThen a year or two later,\nNatalia was at a conference in Bristol,\n\n00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:46.989\nand she saw that a colleague\nof hers named Mike Buckley\n\n00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:52.853\nwas demoing this new process\nthat he called \"collagen fingerprinting.\"\n\n00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:56.885\nIt turns out that different species\nhave slightly different structures\n\n00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.061\nof collagen,\n\n00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:00.901\nso if you get a collagen profile\nof an unknown bone,\n\n00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:03.119\nyou can compare it\nto those of known species,\n\n00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:05.681\nand, who knows, maybe you get a match.\n\n00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:09.783\nSo she shipped him one of the fragments,\n\n00:04:09.807 --> 00:04:11.101\nFedEx.\n\n00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:14.935\n(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it.\nIt's kind of important.\n\n00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.212\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:17.427\nLN: And he processed it,\n\n00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:21.813\nand compared it to 37 known\nand modern-day mammal species.\n\n00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:23.909\nAnd he found a match.\n\n00:04:24.782 --> 00:04:29.394\nIt turns out that\nthe 3.5 million-year-old bone\n\n00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:33.048\nthat Natalia had dug\nout of the High Arctic\n\n00:04:33.687 --> 00:04:34.881\nbelonged to ...\n\n00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:37.306\na camel.\n\n00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.061\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:43.383\n(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what?\nThat's amazing -- if it's true.\n\n00:04:43.407 --> 00:04:45.459\nLN: So they tested\na bunch of the fragments,\n\n00:04:45.483 --> 00:04:47.727\nand they got the same result for each one.\n\n00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:53.575\nHowever, based on the size\nof the bone that they found,\n\n00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.962\nit meant that this camel was 30 percent\nlarger than modern-day camels.\n\n00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:03.176\nSo this camel would have been\nabout nine feet tall,\n\n00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.398\nweighed around a ton.\n\n00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:05.473\n(Audience reacts)\n\n00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:06.546\nYeah.\n\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.063\nNatalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.\n\n00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:12.229\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:16.672\nNow, when you hear the word \"camel,\"\n\n00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:20.621\nwhat may come to mind is one of these,\n\n00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:24.829\nthe Bactrian camel\nof East and Central Asia.\n\n00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:28.338\nBut chances are the postcard image\nyou have in your brain\n\n00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:31.917\nis one of these, the dromedary,\n\n00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:34.369\nquintessential desert creature --\n\n00:05:34.393 --> 00:05:38.712\nhangs out in sandy, hot places\nlike the Middle East and the Sahara,\n\n00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:40.216\nhas a big old hump on its back\n\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.757\nfor storing water\nfor those long desert treks,\n\n00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:46.162\nhas big, broad feet to help it\ntromp over sand dunes.\n\n00:05:46.876 --> 00:05:52.888\nSo how on earth would one of these guys\nend up in the High Arctic?\n\n00:05:53.677 --> 00:05:56.464\nWell, scientists have known\nfor a long time, turns out,\n\n00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:59.050\neven before Natalia's discovery,\n\n00:05:59.074 --> 00:06:04.692\nthat camels are actually\noriginally American.\n\n00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:10.416\n(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)\n\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.899\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:11.923 --> 00:06:13.454\nThey started here.\n\n00:06:13.478 --> 00:06:18.312\nFor nearly 40 of the 45 million years\nthat camels have been around,\n\n00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.495\nyou could only find them in North America,\n\n00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:24.772\naround 20 different species, maybe more.\n\n00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:28.041\n(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup,\nwould they look different?\n\n00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:30.500\nNR: Yeah, you're going to have\ndifferent body sizes.\n\n00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:32.436\nYou'll have some with really long necks,\n\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.705\nso they're actually\nfunctionally like giraffes.\n\n00:06:35.303 --> 00:06:38.375\nLN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.\n\n00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:41.983\n(Audio) NR: The really primitive,\nearly ones would have been really small,\n\n00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:44.510\nalmost like rabbits.\n\n00:06:44.534 --> 00:06:47.381\nLN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?\n\n00:06:47.405 --> 00:06:48.842\n(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.\n\n00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:51.101\nSo those ones you probably\nwould not recognize.\n\n00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.315\nLN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.\n\n00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.383\n(Audio) NR: I know,\nwouldn't that be great?\n\n00:06:55.407 --> 00:06:56.579\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:59.262\nLN: And then about three\nto seven million years ago,\n\n00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:02.094\none branch of camels\nwent down to South America,\n\n00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:05.072\nwhere they became llamas and alpacas,\n\n00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:08.018\nand another branch crossed over\nthe Bering Land Bridge\n\n00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:09.478\ninto Asia and Africa.\n\n00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:11.923\nAnd then around the end\nof the last ice age,\n\n00:07:11.947 --> 00:07:15.046\nNorth American camels went extinct.\n\n00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:18.271\nSo, scientists knew all of that already,\n\n00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:24.371\nbut it still doesn't fully explain\nhow Natalia found one so far north.\n\n00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:29.069\nLike, this is, temperature-wise,\nthe polar opposite of the Sahara.\n\n00:07:29.093 --> 00:07:31.594\nNow to be fair,\n\n00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.301\nthree and a half million years ago,\n\n00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:37.424\nit was on average 22 degrees Celsius\nwarmer than it is now.\n\n00:07:37.448 --> 00:07:40.383\nSo it would have been boreal forest,\n\n00:07:40.407 --> 00:07:44.321\nso more like the Yukon or Siberia today.\n\n00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:48.517\nBut still, like, they would have\nsix-month-long winters\n\n00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:50.764\nwhere the ponds would freeze over.\n\n00:07:50.788 --> 00:07:52.256\nYou'd have blizzards.\n\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.891\nYou'd have 24 hours a day\nof straight darkness.\n\n00:07:55.915 --> 00:07:58.896\nLike, how ... How?\n\n00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.078\nHow is it that one of these\nSaharan superstars\n\n00:08:03.102 --> 00:08:06.333\ncould ever have survived\nthose arctic conditions?\n\n00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:09.333\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:13.045\nNatalia and her colleagues\nthink they have an answer.\n\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.600\nAnd it's kind of brilliant.\n\n00:08:16.658 --> 00:08:23.191\nWhat if the very features that we imagine\nmake the camel so well-suited\n\n00:08:23.215 --> 00:08:25.183\nto places like the Sahara,\n\n00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:28.619\nactually evolved to help it\nget through the winter?\n\n00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:34.103\nWhat if those broad feet were meant\nto tromp not over sand,\n\n00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:37.147\nbut over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?\n\n00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.551\nWhat if that hump --\nwhich, huge news to me,\n\n00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:42.949\ndoes not contain water, it contains fat --\n\n00:08:42.973 --> 00:08:44.552\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:48.177\nwas there to help the camel\nget through that six-month-long winter,\n\n00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:49.878\nwhen food was scarce?\n\n00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:53.615\nAnd then, only later, long after\nit crossed over the land bridge\n\n00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:58.057\ndid it retrofit those winter features\nfor a hot desert environment?\n\n00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:02.155\nLike, for instance, the hump\nmay be helpful to camels in hotter climes\n\n00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:04.651\nbecause having all your fat in one place,\n\n00:09:04.675 --> 00:09:07.416\nlike a, you know, fat backpack,\n\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.968\nmeans that you don't have\nto have that insulation\n\n00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:11.751\nall over the rest of your body.\n\n00:09:11.775 --> 00:09:14.025\nSo it helps heat dissipate easier.\n\n00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:17.354\nIt's this crazy idea,\n\n00:09:17.378 --> 00:09:22.925\nthat what seems like proof of the camel's\nquintessential desert nature\n\n00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:26.649\ncould actually be proof\nof its High Arctic past.\n\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.500\nNow, I'm not the first person\nto tell this story.\n\n00:09:31.524 --> 00:09:36.474\nOthers have told it as a way\nto marvel at evolutionary biology\n\n00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:39.851\nor as a keyhole into the future\nof climate change.\n\n00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.050\nBut I love it for a totally\ndifferent reason.\n\n00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:46.471\nFor me, it's a story about us,\n\n00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:48.463\nabout how we see the world\n\n00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.791\nand about how that changes.\n\n00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:54.988\nSo I was trained as a historian.\n\n00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:59.265\nAnd I've learned that, actually,\na lot of scientists are historians, too.\n\n00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:00.838\nThey make sense of the past.\n\n00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:06.187\nThey tell the history of our universe,\nof our planet, of life on this planet.\n\n00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:08.176\nAnd as a historian,\n\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.571\nyou start with an idea in your mind\nof how the story goes.\n\n00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.639\n(Audio) NR: We make up stories\nand we stick with it,\n\n00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:17.385\nlike the camel in the desert, right?\n\n00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.855\nThat's a great story!\nIt's totally adapted for that.\n\n00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:22.108\nClearly, it always lived there.\n\n00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:26.434\nLN: But at any moment, you could\nuncover some tiny bit of evidence.\n\n00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:28.657\nYou could learn some tiny thing\n\n00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:32.640\nthat forces you to reframe\neverything you thought you knew.\n\n00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:36.442\nLike, in this case, this one scientist\nfinds this one shard\n\n00:10:36.466 --> 00:10:38.213\nof what she thought was wood,\n\n00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:43.275\nand because of that, science has a totally\nnew and totally counterintuitive theory\n\n00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:46.914\nabout why this absurd\nDr. Seuss-looking creature\n\n00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.470\nlooks the way it does.\n\n00:10:48.494 --> 00:10:53.898\nAnd for me, it completely upended\nthe way I think of the camel.\n\n00:10:53.922 --> 00:10:58.304\nIt went from being\nthis ridiculously niche creature\n\n00:10:58.328 --> 00:11:00.677\nsuited only to this\none specific environment,\n\n00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:05.989\nto being this world traveler\nthat just happens to be in the Sahara,\n\n00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:09.138\nand could end up virtually anywhere.\n\n00:11:09.838 --> 00:11:15.813\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:27.812\nThis is Azuri.\n\n00:11:28.547 --> 00:11:31.427\nAzuri, hi, how are you doing?\n\n00:11:31.451 --> 00:11:33.999\nOK, here, I've got\none of these for you here.\n\n00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:36.069\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:36.093 --> 00:11:40.276\nSo Azuri is on a break\nfrom her regular gig\n\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.523\nat the Radio City Music Hall.\n\n00:11:42.547 --> 00:11:44.696\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.302\nThat's not even a joke.\n\n00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:48.412\nAnyway --\n\n00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:52.793\nBut really, Azuri is here\nas a living reminder\n\n00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:57.064\nthat the story of our world\nis a dynamic one.\n\n00:11:57.088 --> 00:12:01.795\nIt requires our willingness\nto readjust, to reimagine.\n\n00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:06.096\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.571\nRight, Azuri?\n\n00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:14.011\nAnd, really, that we're all\njust one shard of bone away\n\n00:12:14.035 -->

Twitter", "duration": "862", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/siyanda_mohutsiwa_how_young_africans_found_a_voice_on_twitter", "transcript": "It began with one question: If Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing? I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa, which wasn't exactly according to the rules because South Africa's not my country. But alluding to the country's continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid, I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach.And then I waited. And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line. So, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country and a few other African countries I'm familiar with. And then I waited again, but this time I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted to convince myself, no, to remind myself that I'm really funny and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.But luckily, I didn't have to do that for very long. Very soon, people were participating. In fact, by the end of that week in July, the hashtag #ifafricawasabar would have garnered around 60,000 tweets, lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world.People were using the hashtag to do many different things. To poke fun at their stereotypes: [#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee, all he needs is the bouncer's account details.](Laughter)To criticize government spending: [#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce running a tab it won't be able to pay]To make light of geopolitical tensions: [#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy with serious anger management issues.]To remind us that even in Africa there are some countries we don't know exist: [#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.]And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa: [#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco be like \"What the hell are we doing here?!!\"](Laughter)And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround: [#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]But most importantly, people were using the hashtag to connect. People were connecting over their Africanness. So for one week in July, Twitter became a real African bar. And I was really thrilled, mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work, that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other.My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa, I'm 22 years old and I am Pan-Africanist by birth. Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth because my parents are from two different African countries. My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa. It's only slightly bigger than Germany. This year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy. And it has some very progressive social policies. My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland. It's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa. It is Africa's last complete monarchy. So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition, for a very long time.On paper, these countries seem very different. And when I was a kid, I could see the difference. It rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other. But outside of that, I didn't really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places. But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me. You see, I was born in one country and raised in the other.When we moved to Botswana, I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati and nothing else. So I was being introduced to my new home, my new cultural identity, as a complete outsider, incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward. But very soon, I would shed SiSwati. And when I would go back to Swaziland, I would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system, whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you, and I would have a very peculiar adolescence. But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here, in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously. I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity.Since then, I have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean. I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies. When I began to read, I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon, who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness. And when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas, I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Congo's Patrice Lumumba. I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on.So when Twitter came, I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff.The year was 2011 and all over southern Africa and the whole continent, affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get. So my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity. On long commutes to work, in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to, on our lunch breaks, we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and African.But of course, this luxury was not available to everybody. So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet, one, you had to tweet in English. Two, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online. You had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians. And suddenly, your whole world opened up. And my whole world did open up.I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent, taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag #myafrica. Because at that time, if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media, you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts.(Laughter)But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors. It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria. It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi.And these were the same Africans that I began to meet in my own travels around the continent. We would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy. But almost invariably, every single time, we would end up discussing Twitter. And that's when I realized what this was. We were standing in the middle of something amazing, because for the first time ever young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time, without the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments.Because the little known truth is many Africans know a lot less about other African countries than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole. This is by accident, but sometimes, it's by design. For example, in apartheid South Africa, black South Africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure. And this was done to convince them that they were much better off under crushing white rule than they were living in a black and free nation. Add to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system, which has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s \u2014 and at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years, but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country. And to me, this doesn't make any sense because whether we like it or not, the fates of African people are deeply intertwined.When disaster hits, when turmoil hits, we share the consequences. When Burundians flee political turmoil, they go to us, to other African countries. Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers. What was once a Burundian problem becomes an African problem. So to me, there are no Sudanese problems or South African problems or Kenyan problems, only African problems because eventually, we share the turmoil.So if we share the problems, why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes? How can we do that? Well, in the long term, we can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade, removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed. But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes is to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism.Now, political Pan-Africanism already exists, so I'm not inventing anything totally new here. But political Pan-Africanism is usually the African unity of the political elite. And who does that benefit? Well, African leaders, almost exclusively. No, what I'm talking about is the Pan-Africanism of the ordinary African. Young Africans like me, we are bursting with creative energy, with innovative ideas. But with bad governance and shaky institutions, all of this potential could go to waste. On a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive, we are in desperate need of something new, something that works. And I think that thing is social Pan-Africanism.My dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation. My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant, they don't say, \"Well, this wouldn't work in my country,\" and then give up. My dream is that young Africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas, is our home. Using the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively, we can begin to innovate together. In Africa, we say, \"If you want to go fast, you go alone, but if you want to go far, you go together.\" And I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together.And this is already happening. Access to these online networks has given young Africans something we've always had to violently take: a voice. We now have a platform. Before now, if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa, you waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth \u2014(Laughter)to wake up in the morning, take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in 20 years time. Before now, if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government, you were pushed to protest, suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care. But now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before.We support South African students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees. We support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament. We support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained. For the first time ever, African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most: other Africans.I believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking and using the Internet as a tool, we can begin to rescue each other, and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2462, "subtitle":

other.\n\n00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:15.254\nBut outside of that,\nI didn't really realize\n\n00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:19.158\nwhy it mattered that my parents\nwere from two different places.\n\n00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:23.854\nBut it would go on\nto have a very peculiar effect on me.\n\n00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:26.614\nYou see, I was born in one country\n\n00:04:26.638 --> 00:04:28.037\nand raised in the other.\n\n00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:30.614\nWhen we moved to Botswana,\n\n00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.574\nI was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati\n\n00:04:33.598 --> 00:04:35.174\nand nothing else.\n\n00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:37.894\nSo I was being introduced to my new home,\n\n00:04:37.918 --> 00:04:40.174\nmy new cultural identity,\n\n00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:42.214\nas a complete outsider,\n\n00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:46.494\nincapable of comprehending\nanything that was being said to me\n\n00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:50.934\nby the family and country whose traditions\nI was meant to move forward.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:55.174\nBut very soon, I would shed SiSwati.\n\n00:04:55.198 --> 00:04:57.454\nAnd when I would go back to Swaziland,\n\n00:04:57.478 --> 00:05:02.078\nI would be constantly confronted\nby how very non-Swazi I was becoming.\n\n00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:06.454\nAdd to that my entry\ninto Africa's private school system,\n\n00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:10.118\nwhose entire purpose\nis to beat the Africanness out of you,\n\n00:05:10.798 --> 00:05:13.638\nand I would have\na very peculiar adolescence.\n\n00:05:14.198 --> 00:05:20.054\nBut I think that my interest\nin ideas of identity was born here,\n\n00:05:20.078 --> 00:05:24.334\nin the strange intersection\nof belonging to two places at once\n\n00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:27.454\nbut not really belonging\nto either one very well\n\n00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:32.678\nand belonging to this vast space\nin between and around simultaneously.\n\n00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:39.718\nI became obsessed with the idea\nof a shared African identity.\n\n00:05:40.518 --> 00:05:43.294\nSince then, I have continued\nto read about politics\n\n00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:46.734\nand geography and identity\nand what all those things mean.\n\n00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:51.494\nI've also held on to a deep curiosity\nabout African philosophies.\n\n00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.774\nWhen I began to read,\n\n00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:56.214\nI gravitated towards the works\nof black intellectuals\n\n00:05:56.238 --> 00:05:58.694\nlike Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,\n\n00:05:58.718 --> 00:06:00.534\nwho tackled complex ideas\n\n00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:03.614\nlike decolonization\nand black consciousness.\n\n00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:07.854\nAnd when I thought, at 14,\nthat I had digested these grand ideas,\n\n00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:11.934\nI moved on to the speeches\nof iconic African statesmen\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.974\nlike Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara\n\n00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:17.414\nand Congo's Patrice Lumumba.\n\n00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:21.814\nI read every piece of African fiction\nthat I could get my hands on.\n\n00:06:21.838 --> 00:06:23.494\nSo when Twitter came,\n\n00:06:23.518 --> 00:06:27.694\nI hopped on with the enthusiasm\nof a teenage girl\n\n00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:33.198\nwhose friends are super, super bored\nof hearing about all this random stuff.\n\n00:06:34.238 --> 00:06:35.574\nThe year was 2011\n\n00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:38.654\nand all over southern Africa\nand the whole continent,\n\n00:06:38.678 --> 00:06:42.574\naffordable data packages\nfor smartphones and Internet surfing\n\n00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:45.414\nbecame much easier to get.\n\n00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:50.894\nSo my generation, we were sending\nmessages to each other on this platform\n\n00:06:50.918 --> 00:06:55.374\nthat just needed 140 characters\nand a little bit of creativity.\n\n00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:57.814\nOn long commutes to work,\n\n00:06:57.838 --> 00:07:01.294\nin lectures that some of us\nshould have been paying attention to,\n\n00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:02.894\non our lunch breaks,\n\n00:07:02.918 --> 00:07:04.934\nwe would communicate as much as we could\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.158\nabout the everyday realities\nof being young and African.\n\n00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:12.334\nBut of course, this luxury\nwas not available to everybody.\n\n00:07:12.358 --> 00:07:16.054\nSo this meant that if you were\na teenage girl in Botswana\n\n00:07:16.078 --> 00:07:18.134\nand you wanted\nto have fun on the Internet,\n\n00:07:18.158 --> 00:07:20.814\none, you had to tweet in English.\n\n00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:25.614\nTwo, you had to follow more than just\nthe three other people you knew online.\n\n00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:30.694\nYou had to follow South Africans,\nZimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.\n\n00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:33.494\nAnd suddenly, your whole world opened up.\n\n00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:35.854\nAnd my whole world did open up.\n\n00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:39.694\nI followed vibrant Africans\nwho were travelling around the continent,\n\n00:07:39.718 --> 00:07:41.174\ntaking pictures of themselves\n\n00:07:41.198 --> 00:07:44.294\nand posting them\nunder the hashtag #myafrica.\n\n00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:45.774\nBecause at that time,\n\n00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.854\nif you were to search Africa\non Twitter or on Google\n\n00:07:48.878 --> 00:07:51.134\nor any kind of social media,\n\n00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.934\nyou would think that the entire continent\nwas just pictures of animals\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.454\nand white guys drinking cocktails\nin hotel resorts.\n\n00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.734\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:00.758 --> 00:08:03.294\nBut Africans were using this platform\n\n00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:07.374\nto take some kind of ownership\nof the tourism sectors.\n\n00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:11.414\nIt was Africans taking selfies\non the beaches of Nigeria.\n\n00:08:11.438 --> 00:08:14.398\nIt was Africans\nin cocktail bars in Nairobi.\n\n00:08:14.998 --> 00:08:17.475\nAnd these were the same Africans\nthat I began to meet\n\n00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:19.934\nin my own travels around the continent.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.934\nWe would discuss African literature,\npolitics, economic policy.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.094\nBut almost invariably, every single time,\n\n00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:31.478\nwe would end up discussing Twitter.\n\n00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:34.558\nAnd that's when I realized what this was.\n\n00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:38.374\nWe were standing in the middle\nof something amazing,\n\n00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:40.694\nbecause for the first time ever\n\n00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:45.774\nyoung Africans could discuss\nthe future of our continent in real time,\n\n00:08:45.798 --> 00:08:50.198\nwithout the restriction of borders,\nfinances and watchful governments.\n\n00:08:50.678 --> 00:08:52.613\nBecause the little known truth is\n\n00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:56.494\nmany Africans know a lot less\nabout other African countries\n\n00:08:56.518 --> 00:08:59.598\nthan some Westerners\nmight know about Africa as a whole.\n\n00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:01.694\nThis is by accident,\n\n00:09:01.718 --> 00:09:03.854\nbut sometimes, it's by design.\n\n00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:06.814\nFor example, in apartheid South Africa,\n\n00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:10.334\nblack South Africans\nwere constantly being bombarded\n\n00:09:10.358 --> 00:09:13.454\nwith this message that any country\nruled by black people\n\n00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:15.454\nwas destined for failure.\n\n00:09:15.478 --> 00:09:18.014\nAnd this was done to convince them\n\n00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:21.694\nthat they were much better off\nunder crushing white rule\n\n00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:25.078\nthan they were living\nin a black and free nation.\n\n00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:30.814\nAdd to that Africa's colonial,\narchaic education system,\n\n00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:34.814\nwhich has been unthinkingly\ncarried over from the 1920s --\n\n00:09:34.838 --> 00:09:39.134\nand at the age of 15,\nI could name all the various causes\n\n00:09:39.158 --> 00:09:43.214\nof the wars that had happened\nin Europe in the past 200 years,\n\n00:09:43.238 --> 00:09:46.078\nbut I couldn't name the president\nof my neighboring country.\n\n00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:49.454\nAnd to me, this doesn't make any sense\n\n00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:51.494\nbecause whether we like it or not,\n\n00:09:51.518 --> 00:09:55.158\nthe fates of African people\nare deeply intertwined.\n\n00:09:55.638 --> 00:09:59.134\nWhen disaster hits, when turmoil hits,\n\n00:09:59.158 --> 00:10:01.294\nwe share the consequences.\n\n00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:04.294\nWhen Burundians flee political turmoil,\n\n00:10:04.318 --> 00:10:05.654\nthey go to us,\n\n00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:07.694\nto other African countries.\n\n00:10:07.718 --> 00:10:11.478\nAfrica has six of the world's\nlargest refugee centers.\n\n00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.934\nWhat was once a Burundian problem\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.974\nbecomes an African problem.\n\n00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:20.574\nSo to me, there are no Sudanese problems\n\n00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:23.014\nor South African problems\nor Kenyan problems,\n\n00:10:23.038 --> 00:10:24.614\nonly African problems\n\n00:10:24.638 --> 00:10:26.958\nbecause eventually, we share the turmoil.\n\n00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:29.294\nSo if we share the problems,\n\n00:10:29.318 --> 00:10:32.558\nwhy aren't we doing a better job\nof sharing the successes?\n\n00:10:33.158 --> 00:10:34.374\nHow can we do that?\n\n00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:35.654\nWell, in the long term,\n\n00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:38.534\nwe can shoot towards\nincreasing inter-African trade,\n\n00:10:38.558 --> 00:10:41.094\nremoving borders\nand putting pressure on leaders\n\n00:10:41.118 --> 00:10:44.518\nto fulfill regional agreements\nthey've already signed.\n\n00:10:45.158 --> 00:10:50.294\nBut I think that the biggest way\nfor Africa to share its successes\n\n00:10:50.318 --> 00:10:54.758\nis to foster something\nI like to call social Pan-Africanism.\n\n00:10:55.278 --> 00:10:58.134\nNow, political Pan-Africanism\nalready exists,\n\n00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.758\nso I'm not inventing anything\ntotally new here.\n\n00:11:01.318 --> 00:11:02.894\nBut political Pan-Africanism\n\n00:11:02.918 --> 00:11:06.454\nis usually the African unity\nof the political elite.\n\n00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:07.814\nAnd who does that benefit?\n\n00:11:07.838 --> 00:11:10.598\nWell, African leaders, almost exclusively.\n\n00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:14.134\nNo, what I'm talking about\n\n00:11:14.158 --> 00:11:17.238\nis the Pan-Africanism\nof the ordinary African.\n\n00:11:17.798 --> 00:11:19.854\nYoung Africans like me,\n\n00:11:19.878 --> 00:11:22.854\nwe are bursting with creative energy,\n\n00:11:22.878 --> 00:11:25.374\nwith innovative ideas.\n\n00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:28.774\nBut with bad governance\nand shaky institutions,\n\n00:11:28.798 --> 00:11:31.454\nall of this potential could go to waste.\n\n00:11:31.478 --> 00:11:34.014\nOn a continent where more\nthan a handful of leaders\n\n00:11:34.038 --> 00:11:35.894\nhave been in power longer\n\n00:11:35.918 --> 00:11:39.318\nthan the majority\nof the populations has been alive,\n\n00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:43.118\nwe are in desperate need of something new,\n\n00:11:43.718 --> 00:11:45.438\nsomething that works.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:50.918\nAnd I think that thing\nis social Pan-Africanism.\n\n00:11:51.518 --> 00:11:54.654\nMy dream is that young Africans\n\n00:11:54.678 --> 00:12:00.214\nstop allowing borders and circumstance\nto suffocate our innovation.\n\n00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:04.574\nMy dream is that when a young African\ncomes up with something brilliant,\n\n00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:08.014\nthey don't say, \"Well,\nthis wouldn't work in my country,\"\n\n00:12:08.038 --> 00:12:09.454\nand then give up.\n\n00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:13.134\nMy dream is that young Africans\nbegin to realize\n\n00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:17.478\nthat the entire continent\nis our canvas, is our home.\n\n00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:23.214\nUsing the Internet,\nwe can begin to think collaboratively,\n\n00:12:23.238 --> 00:12:25.814\nwe can begin to innovate together.\n\n00:12:25.838 --> 00:12:29.414\nIn Africa, we say,\n\"If you want to go fast, you go alone,\n\n00:12:29.438 --> 00:12:32.294\nbut if you want to go far,\nyou go together.\"\n\n00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:38.078\nAnd I believe that social Pan-Africanism\nis how we can go far together.\n\n00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:41.454\nAnd this is already happening.\n\n00:12:41.478 --> 00:12:44.454\nAccess to these online networks\nhas given young Africans\n\n00:12:44.478 --> 00:12:48.854\nsomething we've always\nhad to violently take: a voice.\n\n00:12:48.878 --> 00:12:50.774\nWe now have a platform.\n\n00:12:50.798 --> 00:12:54.734\nBefore now, if you wanted\nto hear from the youth in Africa,\n\n00:12:54.758 --> 00:12:58.494\nyou waited for the 65-year-old\nminister of youth --\n\n00:12:58.518 --> 00:12:59.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:01.358\nto wake up in the morning,\n\n00:13:01.918 --> 00:13:03.998\ntake his heartburn medication\n\n00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:08.214\nand then tell you the plans\nhe has for your generation\n\n00:13:08.238 --> 00:13:09.718\nin 20 years time.\n\n00:13:10.358 --> 00:13:16.294\nBefore now, if you wanted to be heard\nby your possibly tyrannical government,\n\n00:13:16.318 --> 00:13:19.694\nyou were pushed to protest,\nsuffer the consequences\n\n00:13:19.718 --> 00:13:21.374\nand have your fingers crossed\n\n00:13:21.398 --> 00:13:24.918\nthat some Western paper somewhere\nmight make someone care.\n\n00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:28.334\nBut now we have opportunities\nto back each other up\n\n00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:30.574\nin ways we never could before.\n\n00:13:30.598 --> 00:13:32.334\nWe support South African students\n\n00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:35.974\nwho are marching against\nridiculously high tertiary fees.\n\n00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:39.334\nWe support Zimbabwean women\nwho are marching to parliament.\n\n00:13:39.358 --> 00:13:42.798\nWe support Angolan journalists\nwho are being illegally detained.\n\n00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:45.654\nFor the first time ever,\n\n00:13:45.678 --> 00:13:50.134\nAfrican pain and African aspiration\n\n00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:53.454\nhas the ability to be witnessed\n\n00:13:53.478 --> 00:13:57.094\nby those who can empathize\nwith it the most:\n\n00:13:57.118 --> 00:13:58.398\nother Africans.\n\n00:13:58.878 --> 00:14:02.814\nI believe that with\na social Pan-Africanist thinking\n\n00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:04.878\nand using the Internet as a tool,\n\n00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:08.734\nwe can begin to rescue each other,\n\n00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:12.334\nand ultimately, to rescue ourselves.\n\n00:14:12.358 --> 00:14:13.574\nThank you.\n\n00:14:13.598 --> 00:14:21.506\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A futuristic vision of the age of holograms", "duration": "1145", "url":

where humans communicated, were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen.Today, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens. What happened to interacting with each other? I don't know about you, but I feel limited inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels. And it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator. Put simply: I want to create a new reality, a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other, a reality where people, not devices, are the center of everything.I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel; a reality where technology no longer gets in our way, but instead embraces who we are. I dream of technology on a human path. We have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people, products that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics.This is the next step in the evolution. This is Microsoft HoloLens, the first fully untethered holographic computer. Devices like this will bring 3D holographic content right into our world, enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions. Now, I'm not thinking about a distant future. I'm talking about today. We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with HoloLens; universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn; and my personal favorite, NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically.Now, this is important. By bringing holograms into our world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines of traditional computing.Put it this way: temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms. We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave. Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day. And now for the next few minutes, I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us.Now, as I put this HoloLens on, let me explain the setup a little bit. It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with HoloLens, and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED. Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage, just as clearly as I can see all of you. Now at the same time, we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors.So let's start our journey. And what better place to begin our journey, than in the computer cave of 2D. Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens, and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective.The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive. It's a universe based on causality. As developers, we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects. Double click on an icon, that's a cause. Open an application, that's an effect. Now when we compare this to our physical universe, it is overly constraining, because our universe is not digital. Our universe is analog. Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one, true or false, or black or white. We exist in a world governed by quantum physics, a universe of zero and one both at the same time, a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray. You can see how these two worlds collide.So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life? We see screens from the moment we wake up, to the moment we fall asleep. Why?I think it's because computers give us superpowers. Within the digital universe, we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time. It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment, productivity or communication. Think of it this way: let's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television. This is theater \u2014 time and space displaced. As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk, I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle. That's displacement of space. Now, these are such great superpowers that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations of our current digital world. But what if we didn't have to? What if we could have these same digital powers in our world? You can already see glimmers of this, but I believe our children's children will grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology. It's remarkable to dream of this world, a world where technology truly understands us \u2014 where we live, work and communicate \u2014 with tools that enhance the human experience, not machines that limit our humanity.So how do we get there? For me, the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective. It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine. If you're a machine trying to sense our world, how would you actually break the problem down? You'd probably try to classify things as a human, an environment or an object. But how would that machine then interact with reality? And I can think of three ways.First, as a machine, I would observe or I would input reality. Speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective. Secondly, as a machine, I could place digital information, or output information, into reality. Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective. Finally, as a machine, I could exchange energy with the world via haptics. Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object, or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force.With this perspective, we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix. Now here's a secret: as an engineer, I get really excited anytime I can reduce something to the matrix. From self-driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head, machines are becoming capable of understanding our world. And they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways.Now, imagine having granular control over everything in the world. Move the dial one way, and you get reality. Move the dial the other way, and you get virtual reality. Now, imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds. I love it down here. Now, imagine if I could look at all of you and dial from real humans into elves. When technology truly understands our world, it will again transform the ways we interact, the ways we work and the ways we play.Less than half a century ago, two courageous men landed on the moon, using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets. Six hundred million humans watched them on grainy, black-and-white televisions. And the world? The world was mesmerized.Now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands this world. We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist. And I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence in our near future. In fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far, let's try doing something else even more crazy. I invite you to experience, for the first time anywhere in the world, here on the TED stage, a real-life holographic teleportation, between me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff?(Applause)JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?JN: Well, I'm actually in three places. I'm standing in a room across the street, while I'm standing on this stage with you, while I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away.AK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy! Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from Mars is coming from?JN: Absolutely. This is a precise holographic replica of Mars, built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover, that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth. Humans are natural explorers. We can instantly understand an environment, just by being present in it. We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach. But for decades, we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards. Now, we're leaping over all of that, over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there. Today, a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before \u2014 an alien world made a little more familiar, because they're finally exploring it as humans should.But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there. When we dial this real world to the virtual, we can do magical things. We can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain. Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it. We're taking the first steps. But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next, because this is not a journey for a few, but for all of us.AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing. Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today.(Applause)JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.AK: Bye, Jeff.(Applause)I dream about this future every single day. I take inspiration from our ancestors. We used to live in tribes where we interacted, communicated and worked together. We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today \u2014 technology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels, and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3D world. It's a phenomenal time to be human.Thank you.(Applause)Helen Walters: Thanks so much. I have some questions.AK: OK.HW: So there's been some talk in the press. And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer. There's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product. Talk about this field of view issue. Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?AK: It's a great question, Or, said better, this is a question we've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year. If you do your research, I haven't answered that question. I've purposely ignored it, because ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask. That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time, and you then saying, \"What's the size of your television?\" The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant. What we should be talking about is the density of lights, or radiance, that shows up. Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see. So from that perspective, what you saw \u2014 you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens. So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.HW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right?AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it. It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is. So if you think about the points of light that show up radially from the vision of the camera, which is the thing that matters: how many points of light can I get in a given volume? That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one. Now, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?HW: Jesus Christ!(Laughter)AK: He did show up! I told you he'd show up. Come this way.(Laughter)HW: Oh, shit.AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.HW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what.AK: So in short: to be super crisp, the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye. But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see, the points of light per unit of area, are actually the same.HW: So you spent \u2014 Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute \u2014 so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage \u2014AK: That's right.HW: So help me out here: if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home, I don't need to map my apartment, right?AK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second, with this technology that we call spatial mapping. So in your home, as soon as you put it on, holograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them and they'll start learning your home. In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down, we don't take the risk of trying to do this live. So what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial-mapping technology that you'll use with the product at home, and then we store it, so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this, between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head, we don't have things disappear. Because ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens, and that one is just viewing the HoloLens. So if I lose connectivity, you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen.HW: And it was beautiful. Um ... Jeff?JN: Yes?HW: Hi.AK: I'll take a step back.HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars, you were here, you were in a room across the street. Tell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight but you don't have touch, you don't have smell. Is this scientifically useful now? That's my question for a hologram.JN: Thanks for the question. Absolutely, I believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now, and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA. So we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars. We're also using it for our astronauts on the space station. We're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft.HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much.(Laughter)Alex, really, that was amazing. Thank you so much.AK: Thank you.HW: Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2461, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:14.418\nThousands of years from now,\n\n00:00:15.046 -->

00:05:36.292\nWhy?\n\n00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:39.779\nI think it's because computers\ngive us superpowers.\n\n00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:44.057\nWithin the digital universe,\nwe have the power to displace space\n\n00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:45.832\nand the power to displace time.\n\n00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.675\nIt doesn't matter if you're using\ntechnology for entertainment,\n\n00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.924\nproductivity or communication.\n\n00:05:52.658 --> 00:05:53.819\nThink of it this way:\n\n00:05:53.843 --> 00:05:55.223\nlet's all go home tonight\n\n00:05:55.247 --> 00:05:57.913\nand watch our favorite show on television.\n\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.962\nThis is theater -- time\nand space displaced.\n\n00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.692\nAs soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,\n\n00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:08.033\nI'm going to immediately call\nmy lovely family in Seattle.\n\n00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.100\nThat's displacement of space.\n\n00:06:14.046 --> 00:06:16.269\nNow, these are such great superpowers\n\n00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:19.242\nthat we put up with\nthe two-dimensional limitations\n\n00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:21.055\nof our current digital world.\n\n00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.594\nBut what if we didn't have to?\n\n00:06:23.138 --> 00:06:26.318\nWhat if we could have\nthese same digital powers\n\n00:06:27.126 --> 00:06:28.963\nin our world?\n\n00:06:29.924 --> 00:06:32.320\nYou can already see glimmers of this,\n\n00:06:32.344 --> 00:06:34.996\nbut I believe our children's children\n\n00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.963\nwill grow up in a world\ndevoid of 2D technology.\n\n00:06:40.037 --> 00:06:42.452\nIt's remarkable to dream of this world,\n\n00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:46.665\na world where technology\ntruly understands us --\n\n00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.219\nwhere we live, work and communicate --\n\n00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:52.365\nwith tools that enhance\nthe human experience,\n\n00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:56.576\nnot machines that limit our humanity.\n\n00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.854\nSo how do we get there?\n\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.230\nFor me, the answer required\nlooking at the problem\n\n00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:06.729\nfrom a different perspective.\n\n00:07:08.888 --> 00:07:12.694\nIt required sensing the world\nfrom the perspective of a machine.\n\n00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.989\nIf you're a machine trying\nto sense our world,\n\n00:07:18.013 --> 00:07:20.317\nhow would you actually\nbreak the problem down?\n\n00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:23.790\nYou'd probably try to classify things\n\n00:07:23.814 --> 00:07:24.979\nas a human,\n\n00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:27.338\nan environment\n\n00:07:28.957 --> 00:07:30.147\nor an object.\n\n00:07:31.931 --> 00:07:36.160\nBut how would that machine\nthen interact with reality?\n\n00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:38.646\nAnd I can think of three ways.\n\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.836\nFirst, as a machine,\n\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.778\nI would observe or I would input reality.\n\n00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:48.487\nSpeech recognition\nand biometric authentication\n\n00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:51.771\nare great examples of a machine\ninteracting with humans\n\n00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:53.510\nfrom an input perspective.\n\n00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.730\nSecondly, as a machine,\n\n00:07:56.754 --> 00:08:01.865\nI could place digital information,\nor output information,\n\n00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.054\ninto reality.\n\n00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:08.569\nHolograms are examples of a machine\ninteracting with an environment\n\n00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:10.053\nfrom an output perspective.\n\n00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:13.044\nFinally, as a machine,\n\n00:08:13.068 --> 00:08:16.600\nI could exchange energy\nwith the world via haptics.\n\n00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:22.350\nNow, imagine being able to feel\nthe temperature of a virtual object,\n\n00:08:22.374 --> 00:08:25.593\nor better yet, imagine pushing a hologram\n\n00:08:25.617 --> 00:08:28.450\nand having it push you back\nwith equal force.\n\n00:08:29.413 --> 00:08:30.634\nWith this perspective,\n\n00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:36.106\nwe are able to collapse reality\ninto a simple matrix.\n\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.281\nNow here's a secret:\n\n00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:39.363\nas an engineer, I get really excited\n\n00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:42.241\nanytime I can reduce\nsomething to the matrix.\n\n00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:44.780\nFrom self-driving cars\n\n00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:46.393\nto smartphones\n\n00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:48.739\nto this holographic computer on my head,\n\n00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:52.545\nmachines are becoming capable\nof understanding our world.\n\n00:08:53.251 --> 00:08:55.786\nAnd they are starting to interact with us\n\n00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.925\nin significantly more personal ways.\n\n00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:03.780\nNow, imagine having granular control\n\n00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:05.640\nover everything in the world.\n\n00:09:06.738 --> 00:09:08.423\nMove the dial one way,\n\n00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:12.103\nand you get reality.\n\n00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:15.309\nMove the dial the other way,\n\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.061\nand you get virtual reality.\n\n00:09:21.706 --> 00:09:26.797\nNow, imagine dialing\nyour entire environment\n\n00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:29.954\nbetween virtual and real worlds.\n\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.835\nI love it down here.\n\n00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:40.088\nNow, imagine if I could look at all of you\n\n00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:43.522\nand dial from real humans into elves.\n\n00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:47.482\nWhen technology truly\nunderstands our world,\n\n00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:51.153\nit will again transform\nthe ways we interact,\n\n00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:54.105\nthe ways we work and the ways we play.\n\n00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:00.907\nLess than half a century ago,\n\n00:10:01.756 --> 00:10:03.835\ntwo courageous men landed on the moon,\n\n00:10:04.654 --> 00:10:08.465\nusing computers that were less powerful\nthan the phones in your pockets.\n\n00:10:09.068 --> 00:10:12.179\nSix hundred million humans watched them\n\n00:10:12.203 --> 00:10:14.966\non grainy, black-and-white televisions.\n\n00:10:15.537 --> 00:10:16.695\nAnd the world?\n\n00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:19.449\nThe world was mesmerized.\n\n00:10:19.988 --> 00:10:24.314\nNow imagine how our children\nand their children\n\n00:10:24.944 --> 00:10:28.481\nwill experience the continued\nexploration of space\n\n00:10:28.505 --> 00:10:32.456\nwith technology\nthat understands this world.\n\n00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:37.647\nWe already live in a world where\nreal-time universal translators exist.\n\n00:10:38.132 --> 00:10:43.267\nAnd I can squint, and I can already\nsee holographic telepresence\n\n00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.465\nin our near future.\n\n00:10:45.037 --> 00:10:48.116\nIn fact, since we've been lucky\nwith our demo so far,\n\n00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.449\nlet's try doing something else\neven more crazy.\n\n00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:53.864\nI invite you to experience,\n\n00:10:53.888 --> 00:10:56.925\nfor the first time anywhere in the world,\n\n00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:59.434\nhere on the TED stage,\n\n00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:02.776\na real-life holographic teleportation,\n\n00:11:03.911 --> 00:11:07.618\nbetween me and my friend,\nDr. Jeffrey Norris,\n\n00:11:07.642 --> 00:11:10.440\nfrom NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n00:11:10.464 --> 00:11:12.498\nFinger crossed. Hi, Jeff.\n\n00:11:14.472 --> 00:11:15.638\nJeff Norris: Hey, Alex.\n\n00:11:15.662 --> 00:11:18.765\nAlex Kipman: Phew! That worked.\nHow are you doing today, Jeff?\n\n00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:20.892\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:20.916 --> 00:11:22.980\nJN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.\n\n00:11:23.004 --> 00:11:26.456\nAK: So, can you tell us a little bit,\nJeff, about where you are?\n\n00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:31.156\nJN: Well, I'm actually in three places.\n\n00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.061\nI'm standing in a room across the street,\n\n00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:37.089\nwhile I'm standing on this stage with you,\n\n00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:41.915\nwhile I'm standing on Mars,\na hundred million miles away.\n\n00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:45.631\nAK: Wow, a hundred million\nmiles away. This is crazy!\n\n00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:48.441\nCan you tell us a little bit more\nabout where all this data\n\n00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:50.154\nfrom Mars is coming from?\n\n00:11:51.963 --> 00:11:53.415\nJN: Absolutely.\n\n00:11:53.439 --> 00:11:57.525\nThis is a precise\nholographic replica of Mars,\n\n00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:00.729\nbuilt from data captured\nby the Curiosity Mars Rover,\n\n00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:03.808\nthat I can explore as easily\nas a place on Earth.\n\n00:12:05.014 --> 00:12:08.268\nHumans are natural explorers.\n\n00:12:08.292 --> 00:12:10.853\nWe can instantly\nunderstand an environment,\n\n00:12:10.877 --> 00:12:12.624\njust by being present in it.\n\n00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:15.751\nWe've built tools like our Mars Rover\n\n00:12:15.775 --> 00:12:19.375\nto extend our vision\nand lengthen our reach.\n\n00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:21.510\nBut for decades,\n\n00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:25.499\nwe've explored from a seat\nbehind screens and keyboards.\n\n00:12:26.737 --> 00:12:29.586\nNow, we're leaping over all of that,\n\n00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.813\nover the giant antennas\nand the relay satellites\n\n00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:35.112\nand the vastness between worlds\n\n00:12:35.136 --> 00:12:40.244\nto take our first steps on this landscape\nas if we were truly there.\n\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.048\nToday, a group of scientists\non our mission\n\n00:12:44.072 --> 00:12:47.456\nare seeing Mars as never before --\n\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.797\nan alien world made\na little more familiar,\n\n00:12:50.821 --> 00:12:54.376\nbecause they're finally exploring it\nas humans should.\n\n00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:59.869\nBut our dreams don't have to end\nwith making it just like being there.\n\n00:12:59.893 --> 00:13:02.307\nWhen we dial this real world\nto the virtual,\n\n00:13:02.331 --> 00:13:04.630\nwe can do magical things.\n\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.441\nWe can see in invisible wavelengths\n\n00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:10.250\nor teleport to the top of a mountain.\n\n00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.405\nPerhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals\nin a rock just by touching it.\n\n00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:18.619\nWe're taking the first steps.\n\n00:13:19.135 --> 00:13:22.885\nBut we want the whole world\nto join us in taking the next,\n\n00:13:22.909 --> 00:13:25.672\nbecause this is not a journey for a few,\n\n00:13:25.696 --> 00:13:27.211\nbut for all of us.\n\n00:13:28.318 --> 00:13:30.183\nAK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.\n\n00:13:30.207 --> 00:13:32.944\nThank you so much for joining us\non the TED stage today.\n\n00:13:32.968 --> 00:13:39.681\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:42.417\nJN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.\n\n00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:43.614\nAK: Bye, Jeff.\n\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.824\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:57.866 --> 00:14:01.079\nI dream about this future\n\n00:14:01.103 --> 00:14:02.831\nevery single day.\n\n00:14:04.038 --> 00:14:06.789\nI take inspiration from our ancestors.\n\n00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:09.338\nWe used to live in tribes\nwhere we interacted,\n\n00:14:09.362 --> 00:14:11.758\ncommunicated and worked together.\n\n00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:17.460\nWe are all beginning to build technology\nthat will enable us to return\n\n00:14:17.484 --> 00:14:20.807\nto the humanity that brought us\nwhere we are today --\n\n00:14:21.377 --> 00:14:26.494\ntechnology that will let us stop living\ninside this 2D world\n\n00:14:26.518 --> 00:14:28.526\nof monitors and pixels,\n\n00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:33.297\nand let us start remembering\nwhat it feels like\n\n00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:36.907\nto live in our 3D world.\n\n00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:41.484\nIt's a phenomenal time to be human.\n\n00:14:42.105 --> 00:14:43.278\nThank you.\n\n00:14:43.302 --> 00:14:48.371\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:50.892\nHelen Walters: Thanks so much.\nI have some questions.\n\n00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:52.067\nAK: OK.\n\n00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:54.513\nHW: So there's been\nsome talk in the press.\n\n00:14:54.537 --> 00:14:57.563\nAnd I'll just ask you straight,\nthen we have a straight answer.\n\n00:14:57.587 --> 00:15:00.269\nThere's been talk about the difference\nbetween the demos\n\n00:15:00.293 --> 00:15:02.475\nand the reality of the commercial product.\n\n00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:04.450\nTalk about this field of view issue.\n\n00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:08.793\nIs this type of experience what someone\nwho buys the product will get?\n\n00:15:08.817 --> 00:15:10.776\nAK: It's a great question,\n\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.451\nOr, said better, this is a question\nwe've been receiving\n\n00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.138\nin the media for possibly the last year.\n\n00:15:16.162 --> 00:15:18.909\nIf you do your research,\nI haven't answered that question.\n\n00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:20.339\nI've purposely ignored it,\n\n00:15:20.363 --> 00:15:22.877\nbecause ultimately,\nit's the wrong question to ask.\n\n00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:29.917\nThat's the equivalent of me showing\nholograms to someone for the first time,\n\n00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:33.751\nand you then saying,\n\"What's the size of your television?\"\n\n00:15:33.775 --> 00:15:36.469\nThe field of view for the product\nis almost irrelevant.\n\n00:15:36.493 --> 00:15:39.991\nWhat we should be talking about\nis the density of lights,\n\n00:15:40.015 --> 00:15:41.801\nor radiance, that shows up.\n\n00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:45.196\nBetter said, what the angular resolution\nis of the things that you see.\n\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.220\nSo from that perspective, what you saw --\n\n00:15:47.244 --> 00:15:49.307\nyou know, the camera\nis wearing a HoloLens.\n\n00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:51.315\nSo even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.\n\n00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:54.905\nHW: But the camera has a different lens\non it than

But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression, but a lasting one that remains.I was born in a family full of colors. My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone. He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents. The matriarch, my grandma, has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair. My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone, like my uncle and my cousin. My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian, with a pinch of hazel and honey, and a man [who is] a mix of coffee with milk, but with a lot of coffee. She has two sisters. One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other, also adopted, more on the beige side, like a pancake.(Laughter)Growing up in this family, color was never important for me. Outside home, however, things were different soon. Color had many other meanings.I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings. It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil. I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink. My skin was brown, and people said I was black. I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head.Later, when I took my cousin to school, I was usually taken for the nanny. By helping in the kitchen at a friend's party, people thought I was the maid. I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends. And many times, visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings, I was invited not to use the main elevator. Because in the end, with this color and this hair, I cannot belong to some places.In some way, I get to used to it and accept part of it. However, something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling.Years later I married a Spaniard. But not any Spaniard. I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt.(Laughter)Since then, a new question started to chase me. What will be the color of your children? As you can understand, this is my last concern. But thinking about it, with my previous background, my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer. And that is how Humanae was born.Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors, rather than the untrue white, red, black or yellow associated with race. It's a kind of game to question our codes. It's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history.I portray the subjects in a white background. Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose, paint the background, and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone.I started with my family and friends, then more and more people joined the adventure, thanks to public calls coming through the social media.I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain.The snowball started to roll. The project had a great welcome \u2014 invitations, exhibitions, physical formats, galleries and museums ... just happened. And among them, my favorite: when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street, it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community.I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries, 19 different cities around the world. Just to mention some of them \u2014 from someone included in the Forbes list, to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat. In Paris, from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter. And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.All kinds of beliefs, gender identities or physical impairments, a newborn or terminally ill. We all together build Humanae.Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other. When modern science is questioning the race concept, what does it mean for us to be black, white, yellow, red? Is it the eye, the nose, the mouth, the hair? Or does it have to do with our origin, nationality or bank account?This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery. Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people. It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label.It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me. I have hundreds of that, I will share with you, too.A mother of 11 years \u2014 A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me, \"Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence, as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway. So your work has a very special place in my heart and it's very important for me.\"A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote, \"All my life, people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group, a stereotype, a box. Perhaps we should stop. Instead of framing, ask the individual, 'How would you label yourself?' Then I would say, 'Hi. I'm Massiel. I'm a Dominican-Dutch, I grew up in a mixed family and I'm a bisexual woman.' \"Besides these unexpected and touching reactions, Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields. Just to show you some examples, illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies. It's a collection of faces.Researchers in the fields of anthropology, physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity, optophysiology, face recognition or Alzheimer's.One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs, one of the most relevant political publications. And talking about foreign affairs, I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ... teachers. They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes. Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes, but this time as a teacher myself.My students, both adults and kids, paint their self-portraits, trying to discover their own unique color.As a photographer, I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate. As an individual, as Ang\u00e9lica, every time I take a picture, I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist. All the frustration, fear and loneliness that I once felt ... becomes love.The last country \u2014 the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born, Brazil. We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination. That remains a common practice worldwide, and that will not disappear by itself.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.", "id": 2463, "subtitle":

make us rethink\nhow we see each other.\n\n00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:37.934\nWhen modern science\nis questioning the race concept,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:43.838\nwhat does it mean for us\nto be black,

00:07:09.814\nSuddenly I realized that Humanae\nwas useful for many people.\n\n00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:12.094\nIt represents a sort of mirror\n\n00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:16.678\nfor those who cannot find\nthemselves reflected in any label.\n\n00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:18.574\nIt was amazing\n\n00:07:18.598 --> 00:07:21.958\nthat people started to share\ntheir thoughts about the work with

I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons, paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows, trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head. Ultimately, that led me to my dream job. I became a partner at a big New York ad agency.But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997, when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare, being told that my brother was going to die, actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him, then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted, for Matt, to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury. He is definitely my hero.But as much as (Applause) \u2014 yeah, deserves it \u2014(Applause)But as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family, I often think about how much worse it could have been; in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day who aren't as fortunate, who lose loved ones \u2014 brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents. They don't all make national headlines. In fact, most of them don't. They go largely unnoticed, in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal.So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic, because I came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising, which is to try to figure out how to engage people. Only instead of doing it to sell products, doing it to save lives. And that comes down to finding common ground, where what I want overlaps with what you want. And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence, just how much common ground there is.Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt, a sport enjoyed by millions across the US. It's a proud tradition. Families. In some places, the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday. What do hunters want? Well, they want to hunt. They love their guns. They believe deeply in the Second Amendment right to own those guns. But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.In fact, there's a lot of it, starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands. This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people. It's about keeping all guns away from certain people, and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns: convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill. We can all appreciate how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands. In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked 2.4 million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.(Applause)And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those Brady background checks, just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane \u2014 one with security and one with no security. And \u2014(Applause)And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public: 90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales \u2014 including 90 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA members. This is not a controversial idea. In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees. That's about the percentage of the American public that believes the moon landing was a fake.(Laughter)And it's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals. That's the extent to which we agree about background checks.But what about the 300 million guns already out there in homes across America? Well first, it's important to realize that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes of decent, law-abiding people like you and me, who want what we all want \u2014 including keeping our families safe. In fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns. Ten years ago, 42 percent of the American public believed \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that a gun makes your home safer. Today, that number is 63 percent.Why? I kind of hate to say it, because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising, which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times, eventually that lie becomes the truth. And that's exactly what's happened here. The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic of gun violence; blocking pediatricians from talking to parents about the dangers of guns in the home; blocking smart-gun technology and other technology that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns and would save lives. They're desperate to hide the truth, because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.And every day, people are dying as a result. And a lot of those people are children. Every day in the US, nine kids are just shot unintentionally. 900 children and teens take their own lives every year. And here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun. Even two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home, including the terrible tragedy at Sandy Hook. I meet so many of these parents; it's the most heartbreaking part of my job. These are not bad people. They're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision, made based on very bad information that was put into their minds by very bad people, who know good and well the misery that they're causing, but just don't care. And the result is a nightmare \u2014 not only for families like mine, but for, really, at the end of the day, all of us.But I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence. I'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share, which is the dream of a better, safer, future. For my organization, for the Brady Campaign, that dream is reflected in the bold goal to cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025. And I hope to leave all of you here tonight with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach. Because folks, for every great movement around the world, there's a moment where you can look back and say, \"That's when things really started to change.\" And I'm here to say that for the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here.(Applause)We are so clearly at a tipping point, because the American public has come together by the millions like never before, based on that common ground, to say, \"Enough.\" Enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters and churches and schools. Enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets that's claimed the lives of women and young black men in staggering proportions. Enough of easy access to guns by the people that we all agree shouldn't have them. And enough of a small group of craven politicians putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby ahead of the people they have been elected to represent. Enough.(Applause)And the really exciting thing is, it's not just the usual suspects like me that are saying it anymore. It's so much bigger than that. And if you want proof, let's start where most conversations in the US seem to start \u2014 with Kim Kardashian.(Laughter)And here's the thing: it's not really a joke. I mean, think about when issues change. It's when they go from being political and advocacy issues to being part of pop culture, voices coming from everywhere, celebrities using their platforms, musicians, athletes. The NBA has come forward. Conservative pundits that you never would have imagined have come forward. There's real cultural change \u2014 I even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year. That's the extent to which this cultural change is happening. And yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal to her 35 million Twitter followers for expanded background checks.Let's look at the political elections that are heating up. This used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats. Couldn't run from it fast enough. Now candidates are running on it. Some are being forced to reverse very bad positions they defended very comfortably, until very recently. For somebody like me, watching people wave around their negative NRA ratings \u2014 it's almost surreal to watch. We're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby, and ultimately that needs to change. But you know what? We're smarter and we're scrappier, and we have the truth on our side. And we're on offense.You know, they say that the Internet democratizes information. Social media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it have democratized activism. It's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like. Sometimes I think of it \u2014 you know, we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions, kind of like white blood cells. It's enabled us to start to really close \u2014 and this is the bottom line \u2014 close that disgraceful disconnect between what the American public wants and what our elected leaders are doing about it.Until recently, the narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side, from that six percent, outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one. We're flipping that narrative on its head. After that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino, we jammed Congressional switchboards. We put 15,000 calls into Congress in 24 hours. And you know what? We got a vote on a bill that nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon. We're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil, ugly gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade. The stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken. We've seen President Obama's historic executive actions. They don't go all the way, but they are going to save lives, because they expand Brady background checks to thousands of gun sales that didn't have them previously. And we're marching across the country \u2014 we're not just waiting for Congress to act; that would almost be the definition of insanity. We're marching across the country, state by state, marriage-equality style.And you know what? We're winning. Congress is almost always the last to wake up and realize that it's on the wrong side of history. And when they do, it's always because the American public shakes them. And that's exactly what we're doing right now, as we're in this tipping point.You know, recently I was flying cross-country to give a speech to a large group like this, although far less intimidating, and the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge-watching one of my all-time favorite TV shows, \"Mad Men,\" a period TV show about advertising in the 1960s. And as I was trying to think about how to end my remarks, I'd glance up at her screen every now and then, and it seemed that every time I did, I'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children or while pregnant or drinking and driving or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker.And ultimately it dawned on me: what tremendous inspiration to those of us who have this dream to end gun violence. I mean, think about how much the world has changed in a relatively short period of time, how all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal \u2014 some even glamorous or sexy \u2014 have become stigmatized in just a generation or two, once they became conversations about our common ground. That is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create around gun violence.And that's my dream, that maybe someday, some period TV show will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence, and a future generation of children might only be able to imagine how terrible it must have been.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2472, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.436\nOK, so, confession:\n\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.061\nI've always been weirdly\nobsessed with advertising.\n\n00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:23.264\nI remember watching\nSaturday morning cartoons,\n\n00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:25.421\npaying more attention to the commercials\n\n00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:26.752\nthan to the shows,\n\n00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.866\ntrying to figure out how they were trying\nto get inside my head.\n\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.969\nUltimately, that led me to my dream job.\n\n00:00:31.993 --> 00:00:35.271\nI became a partner\nat a big New York ad agency.\n\n00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:41.484\nBut then, all of that suddenly changed\non February 23, 1997,\n\n00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.856\nwhen my little brother Matt\nwas shot in the head\n\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.705\nin a shooting that happened\non the observation deck\n\n00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.845\nof the Empire State Building.\n\n00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:55.031\nSuddenly, my family was thrown\ninto the middle of a nightmare,\n\n00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:59.185\nbeing told that my brother\nwas going to die,\n\n00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.885\nactually being given the opportunity\nto say goodbye to him,\n\n00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.259\nthen several emergency brain surgeries\n\n00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.934\nand now what's amounted, for Matt,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:14.204\nto a lifetime spent courageously\nrecovering from a traumatic brain injury.\n\n00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:16.242\nHe is definitely my hero.\n\n00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:19.401\nBut as much as (Applause) --\nyeah, deserves it --\n\n00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:24.531\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:30.158\nBut as much as this tragedy\nwas a nightmare for my family,\n\n00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:32.733\nI often think about how much worse\nit could have been;\n\n00:01:32.757 --> 00:01:37.816\nin fact, how much worse\nit is for the 90 families every day\n\n00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.720\nwho aren't as fortunate,\n\n00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:45.952\nwho lose loved ones -- brothers,\nsisters, sons, daughters, parents.\n\n00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:48.477\nThey don't all make national headlines.\n\n00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:50.143\nIn fact, most of them don't.\n\n00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:52.239\nThey go largely unnoticed,\n\n00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:58.862\nin a nation that's kind of come to accept\na disgraceful national epidemic\n\n00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:02.284\nas some kind of new normal.\n\n00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:05.104\nSo I quit my job in advertising\n\n00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:10.230\nto try and do something about\nthis disgraceful national epidemic,\n\n00:02:10.254 --> 00:02:11.451\nbecause I came to realize\n\n00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:14.588\nthat the challenges\nto preventing gun violence\n\n00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:18.277\nare actually the same ones\nthat made me love advertising,\n\n00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.784\nwhich is to try to figure out\nhow to engage people.\n\n00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.411\nOnly instead of doing it to sell products,\n\n00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.215\ndoing it to save lives.\n\n00:02:25.684 --> 00:02:30.607\nAnd that comes down to\nfinding common ground,\n\n00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.640\nwhere what I want overlaps\nwith what you want.\n\n00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:37.870\nAnd you might be surprised to learn,\nwhen it comes to gun violence,\n\n00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:39.941\njust how much common ground there is.\n\n00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:42.950\nLet's look, for example,\nat people who love to hunt,\n\n00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:46.156\na sport enjoyed by millions across the US.\n\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.820\nIt's a proud tradition. Families.\n\n00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:49.998\nIn some places,\n\n00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:53.274\nthe first day of hunting season\nis actually a school holiday.\n\n00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.219\nWhat do hunters want?\n\n00:02:55.243 --> 00:02:57.591\nWell, they want to hunt.\nThey love their guns.\n\n00:02:57.615 --> 00:02:58.815\nThey believe deeply\n\n00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.331\nin the Second Amendment right\nto own those guns.\n\n00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:03.634\nBut that doesn't mean\nthere isn't common ground.\n\n00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:05.086\nIn fact, there's a lot of it,\n\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.514\nstarting with the basic idea\nof keeping guns out of dangerous hands.\n\n00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:15.352\nThis isn't about taking\ncertain guns away from all people.\n\n00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:18.252\nIt's about keeping all guns\naway from certain people,\n\n00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:21.741\nand it's the people that, it turns out,\nwe all agree shouldn't have guns:\n\n00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:24.245\nconvicted violent criminals,\ndomestic abusers,\n\n00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.139\nthe dangerously mentally ill.\n\n00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:28.314\nWe can all appreciate\n\n00:03:28.338 --> 00:03:31.245\nhow Brady background checks\nhave been incredibly effective\n\n00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.537\nin keeping guns\nout of those dangerous hands.\n\n00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:37.968\nIn 20 years, Brady background checks\nat federally licensed firearm dealers\n\n00:03:37.992 --> 00:03:41.757\nhave blocked 2.4 million gun sales\n\n00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:44.946\nto those people that we all agree\nshouldn't have guns.\n\n00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:49.344\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:49.368 --> 00:03:53.565\nAnd whether you love guns or hate guns,\nyou probably also appreciate\n\n00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.765\nthat there shouldn't be thousands\nof gun sales every day\n\n00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:58.635\nat guns shows or online\n\n00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.518\nwithout those Brady background checks,\n\n00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:03.542\njust like there shouldn't be two lines\nto get on an airplane --\n\n00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.190\none with security\nand one with no security.\n\n00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:07.365\nAnd --\n\n00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.891\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:14.678\nAnd the numbers show the overwhelming\nagreement among the American public:\n\n00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:18.985\n90 percent of Americans support\nexpanding Brady background checks\n\n00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.643\nto all gun sales -- including\n90 percent of Republicans,\n\n00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.587\nmore than 80 percent of gun owners,\n\n00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:25.863\nmore than 70 percent of NRA members.\n\n00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:27.801\nThis is not a controversial idea.\n\n00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:31.401\nIn fact, only six percent\nof the American public disagrees.\n\n00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:33.790\nThat's about the percentage\nof the American public\n\n00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:36.003\nthat believes the moon landing was a fake.\n\n00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:37.392\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:40.388\nAnd it's also about the percentage\nthat believes the government\n\n00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:44.371\nis putting mind-controlling technology\nin our TV broadcast signals.\n\n00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:47.222\nThat's the extent to which we agree\nabout background checks.\n\n00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:50.794\nBut what about the 300 million guns\n\n00:04:50.818 --> 00:04:53.214\nalready out there in homes across America?\n\n00:04:53.238 --> 00:04:55.008\nWell first, it's important to realize\n\n00:04:55.032 --> 00:04:59.370\nthat those guns are mostly\nin the hands and homes\n\n00:04:59.394 --> 00:05:02.334\nof decent, law-abiding people\nlike you and me,\n\n00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:06.629\nwho want what we all want --\nincluding keeping our families safe.\n\n00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:10.638\nIn fact, that's why more and more people\nare choosing to own guns.\n\n00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:14.997\nTen years ago, 42 percent\nof the American public\n\n00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:19.298\nbelieved -- incorrectly -- that a gun\nmakes your home safer.\n\n00:05:19.322 --> 00:05:22.965\nToday, that number is 63 percent.\n\n00:05:23.742 --> 00:05:24.894\nWhy?\n\n00:05:24.918 --> 00:05:26.116\nI kind of hate to say it,\n\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.730\nbecause it gets to the dark\nunderbelly of advertising,\n\n00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:31.182\nwhich is if you tell\na big enough lie enough times,\n\n00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.047\neventually that lie becomes the truth.\n\n00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.018\nAnd that's exactly what's happened here.\n\n00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:37.584\nThe corporate gun lobby\nhas spent billions of dollars\n\n00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:40.933\nblocking the CDC from doing research\ninto the public health epidemic\n\n00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:42.618\nof gun violence;\n\n00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.802\nblocking pediatricians\nfrom talking to parents\n\n00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:46.637\nabout the dangers of guns in the home;\n\n00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:49.030\nblocking smart-gun technology\nand other technology\n\n00:05:49.054 --> 00:05:51.725\nthat would prevent kids\nfrom firing parents' guns\n\n00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.312\nand would save lives.\n\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.039\nThey're desperate to hide the truth,\n\n00:05:56.063 --> 00:06:00.341\nbecause they view the truth\nas a threat to their bottom line.\n\n00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:01.526\nAnd every day,\n\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.145\npeople are dying as a result.\n\n00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.660\nAnd a lot of those people are children.\n\n00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.403\nEvery day in the US,\n\n00:06:08.427 --> 00:06:11.616\nnine kids are just shot unintentionally.\n\n00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:17.410\n900 children and teens\ntake their own lives every year.\n\n00:06:17.434 --> 00:06:21.184\nAnd here's the thing:\nthey're almost all with a parent's gun.\n\n00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:28.193\nEven two-thirds of school shootings\nhappen with a gun taken from the home,\n\n00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:29.902\nincluding the terrible tragedy\n\n00:06:29.926 --> 00:06:31.202\nat Sandy Hook.\n\n00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.483\nI meet so many of these parents;\n\n00:06:33.507 --> 00:06:35.887\nit's the most heartbreaking\npart of my job.\n\n00:06:36.337 --> 00:06:38.871\nThese are not bad people.\n\n00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:44.649\nThey're just living with the unimaginable\nconsequences of a very bad decision,\n\n00:06:44.673 --> 00:06:47.544\nmade based on very bad information\n\n00:06:47.568 --> 00:06:50.456\nthat was put into their minds\nby very bad people,\n\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.685\nwho know good and well\nthe misery that they're causing,\n\n00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.066\nbut just don't care.\n\n00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:58.997\nAnd the result is a nightmare --\n\n00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:01.591\nnot only for families like mine,\n\n00:07:01.615 --> 00:07:04.984\nbut for, really, at the end\nof the day, all of us.\n\n00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.344\nBut I'm not here to talk\nabout the nightmare of gun violence.\n\n00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:11.404\nI'm here to talk about our dream,\nand it's a dream we all share,\n\n00:07:11.428 --> 00:07:13.904\nwhich is the dream\nof a better, safer, future.\n\n00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:16.630\nFor my organization,\nfor the Brady Campaign,\n\n00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:19.242\nthat dream is reflected in the bold goal\n\n00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:24.036\nto cut the number of gun deaths\nin the US in half by 2025.\n\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.562\nAnd I hope to leave\nall of you here tonight\n\n00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:32.459\nwith a strong sense of exactly why\nthat dream is so absolutely within reach.\n\n00:07:32.483 --> 00:07:33.849\nBecause folks,\n\n00:07:33.873 --> 00:07:36.685\nfor every great movement around the world,\n\n00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:39.496\nthere's a moment\nwhere you can look back and say,\n\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.404\n\"That's when things\nreally started to change.\"\n\n00:07:43.023 --> 00:07:44.247\nAnd I'm here to say\n\n00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.192\nthat for the movement\nto end gun violence in America,\n\n00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:49.798\nthat moment is here.\n\n00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:55.927\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:58.832\nWe are so clearly at a tipping point,\n\n00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:01.967\nbecause the American public\nhas come together by the millions\n\n00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:04.205\nlike never before,\nbased on that common ground,\n\n00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:05.624\nto say, \"Enough.\"\n\n00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:08.855\nEnough of the mass shootings\nin malls and movie theaters\n\n00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.785\nand churches and schools.\n\n00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:15.702\nEnough of the daily terror\nof gun violence in homes and streets\n\n00:08:15.726 --> 00:08:18.933\nthat's claimed the lives of women\nand young black men\n\n00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.379\nin staggering proportions.\n\n00:08:20.403 --> 00:08:22.186\nEnough of easy access to guns\n\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.686\nby the people that we all agree\nshouldn't have them.\n\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.745\nAnd enough of a small group\nof craven politicians\n\n00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:30.058\nputting the interests\nof the corporate gun lobby\n\n00:08:30.082 --> 00:08:33.081\nahead of the people\nthey have been elected to represent.\n\n00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:34.256\nEnough.\n\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.434\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:44.362\nAnd the really exciting thing is,\nit's not just the usual suspects like me\n\n00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:45.918\nthat are saying it anymore.\n\n00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.846\nIt's so much bigger than that.\n\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.021\nAnd if you want proof,\n\n00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:52.597\nlet's start where most conversations\nin the US seem to start --\n\n00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:54.025\nwith Kim Kardashian.\n\n00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:55.239\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:57.382\nAnd here's the thing:\nit's not really a joke.\n\n00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.279\nI mean, think about when issues change.\n\n00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:02.072\nIt's when they go from being\npolitical and advocacy issues\n\n00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:03.502\nto being part of pop culture,\n\n00:09:03.526 --> 00:09:07.095\nvoices coming from everywhere,\ncelebrities using their platforms,\n\n00:09:07.119 --> 00:09:08.720\nmusicians, athletes.\n\n00:09:08.744 --> 00:09:10.000\nThe NBA has come forward.\n\n00:09:10.024 --> 00:09:12.678\nConservative pundits that you never\nwould have imagined\n\n00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:13.853\nhave come forward.\n\n00:09:13.877

Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered, they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities. And as the descendants of these explorers, we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins. But at the same time, distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other, it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore. We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth, and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite, and that our Sun's life is also finite. While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel, few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check. So just a quick show of hands here: how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days? Well, that's a lot of you. How about a few weeks? That's a decent amount. How about a few months? That's pretty good too. Now, let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter. Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days? That's quite a lot. How about a few weeks? So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface. Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found, and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars. So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation? Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth? Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet? And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?But I'm getting ahead of myself. In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun, we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself, in space, on a ship, a hermetic flying can, possibly for many generations.The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months. From astronauts' experiences in space, we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems, among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological. And what about macrogravity, or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on?In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown. So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space. Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented: the microbe, a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing, living machine. It requires fairly little to maintain, offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology. It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body. Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism, microscopic or not, with incredible speed and fidelity. Given the limitations of our man-made machines, synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food, our fuel and our environment, but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space.To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration, let us return to the Mars environment. The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash, with trace amounts of organic material. Let's say, hypothetically, what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth-derived nutrients? The first question we should probably ask is, how would we make our plants cold-tolerant? Because, on average, the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade. The next question we should ask is, how do we make our plants drought-tolerant? Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word \"evaporate.\" Well, it turns out we've already done things like this. By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them, we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes. They're known on Earth as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization. Nature does stuff like this already, without our help. We have simply found more precise ways to do it.So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space? Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all. It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission. One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments. In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term. These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us, but what else can we do? Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species, were evolved uniquely for planet Earth. That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there. And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute, even given ample food, water, air and a suit, we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere. Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet, we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight, or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.So let us appeal to nature for inspiration. Among the plethora of life here on Earth, there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles, or lovers of extreme living conditions, if you'll remember from high school biology. And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans. It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid, and, most notably, radiation. While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known, we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals. To do so is not particularly easy. There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance, and it's not as simple as transferring one gene. But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time, I think to do so is not very hard either. Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation, it would be infinitely better than what we already have, which is just the melanin in our skin. Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation. As difficult as it is to see, homo sapiens, that is humans, evolves every day, and still continues to evolve. Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans, who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions, but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic, the chemical element that can kill the average human being. Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations.But, and this is a big but, such evolution requires two things that we may not always have, or be able to afford, and they are death and time. In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe, we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non-Earth planets. We're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention, during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements. But with every passing day, we approach the age of volitional evolution, a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny. Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms, especially our own, is not without its moral and ethical quandaries. Will engineering ourselves make us less human? But then again, what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious? Where should human genius direct itself? Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it. How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves?I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us. We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage.Mars is a destination, but it will not be our last. Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving. Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going. The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself, and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.Thank you.(Applause)",

face\n\n00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.198\non a planet like Mars.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:37.134\nSo how do we steel ourselves for voyages\nwhose destinations are so far removed\n\n00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:38.638\nfrom a tropical vacation?\n\n00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:42.118\nWill we continuously ship supplies\nfrom Planet Earth?\n\n00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:46.294\nBuild space elevators,\nor impossible miles of transport belts\n\n00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:48.958\nthat tether your planet of choice\nto our home planet?\n\n00:02:50.118 --> 00:02:54.838\nAnd how do we grow things like food\nthat grew up on Earth like us?\n\n00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:58.598\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:02.918\nIn our species' journey\nto find a new home under a new sun,\n\n00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:07.534\nwe are more likely than not\ngoing to be spending much time\n\n00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:09.118\nin the journey itself,\n\n00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:11.414\nin space,\n\n00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:14.118\non a ship, a hermetic flying can,\n\n00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:16.798\npossibly for many generations.\n\n00:03:17.438 --> 00:03:20.854\nThe longest continuous amount of time\nthat any human has spent in space\n\n00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:23.758\nis in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.\n\n00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:26.894\nFrom astronauts' experiences in space,\n\n00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:30.694\nwe know that spending time\nin a microgravity environment\n\n00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:35.294\nmeans bone loss, muscle atrophy,\ncardiovascular problems,\n\n00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:36.894\namong many other complications\n\n00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:40.238\nthat range for the physiological\nto the psychological.\n\n00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:42.574\nAnd what about macrogravity,\n\n00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:45.094\nor any other variation\nin gravitational pull\n\n00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:47.038\nof the planet that we find ourselves on?\n\n00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:52.054\nIn short, our cosmic voyages\nwill be fraught with dangers\n\n00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:53.678\nboth known and unknown.\n\n00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:58.934\nSo far we've been looking to this\nnew piece of mechanical technology\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.214\nor that great next generation robot\n\n00:04:01.238 --> 00:04:04.678\nas part of a lineup to ensure\nour species safe passage in space.\n\n00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:08.494\nWonderful as they are,\nI believe the time has come\n\n00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:12.774\nfor us to complement\nthese bulky electronic giants\n\n00:04:12.798 --> 00:04:14.638\nwith what nature has already invented:\n\n00:04:16.278 --> 00:04:17.654\nthe microbe,\n\n00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:22.894\na single-celled organism that is itself\na self-generating, self-replenishing,\n\n00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:24.118\nliving machine.\n\n00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:27.134\nIt requires fairly little to maintain,\n\n00:04:27.158 --> 00:04:29.054\noffers much flexibility in design\n\n00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:32.398\nand only asks to be carried\nin a single plastic tube.\n\n00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:37.214\nThe field of study that has enabled us\nto utilize the capabilities of the microbe\n\n00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:38.838\nis known as synthetic biology.\n\n00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:43.494\nIt comes from molecular biology,\nwhich has given us antibiotics, vaccines\n\n00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:46.814\nand better ways to observe\nthe physiological nuances\n\n00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:48.038\nof the human body.\n\n00:04:48.478 --> 00:04:50.454\nUsing the tools of synthetic biology,\n\n00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:53.414\nwe can now edit the genes\nof nearly any organism,\n\n00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:55.374\nmicroscopic or not,\n\n00:04:55.398 --> 00:04:57.798\nwith incredible speed and fidelity.\n\n00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:01.614\nGiven the limitations\nof our man-made machines,\n\n00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:05.614\nsynthetic biology will be a means for us\nto engineer not only our food,\n\n00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.374\nour fuel and our environment,\n\n00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:10.694\nbut also ourselves\n\n00:05:10.718 --> 00:05:13.334\nto compensate\nfor our physical inadequacies\n\n00:05:13.358 --> 00:05:15.518\nand to ensure our survival in space.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.174\nTo give you an example\n\n00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:21.014\nof how we can use synthetic biology\nfor space exploration,\n\n00:05:21.038 --> 00:05:22.958\nlet us return to the Mars environment.\n\n00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:28.854\nThe Martian soil composition is similar\nto that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,\n\n00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:30.758\nwith trace amounts of organic material.\n\n00:05:31.358 --> 00:05:33.614\nLet's say, hypothetically,\n\n00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:36.374\nwhat if martian soil\ncould actually support plant growth\n\n00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:38.238\nwithout using Earth-derived nutrients?\n\n00:05:39.318 --> 00:05:41.414\nThe first question\nwe should probably ask is,\n\n00:05:41.438 --> 00:05:43.814\nhow would we make\nour plants cold-tolerant?\n\n00:05:43.838 --> 00:05:45.934\nBecause, on average,\nthe temperature on Mars\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.718\nis a very uninviting\nnegative 60 degrees centigrade.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.734\nThe next question we should ask is,\n\n00:05:51.758 --> 00:05:54.214\nhow do we make\nour plants drought-tolerant?\n\n00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:57.054\nConsidering that most of the water\nthat forms as frost\n\n00:05:57.078 --> 00:05:59.918\nevaporates more quickly\nthan I can say the word \"evaporate.\"\n\n00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:03.678\nWell, it turns out\nwe've already done things like this.\n\n00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:07.734\nBy borrowing genes\nfor anti-freeze protein from fish\n\n00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:10.934\nand genes for drought tolerance\nfrom other plants like rice\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.654\nand then stitching them\ninto the plants that need them,\n\n00:06:13.678 --> 00:06:16.638\nwe now have plants that can tolerate\nmost droughts and freezes.\n\n00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:20.054\nThey're known on Earth as GMOs,\n\n00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:21.878\nor genetically modified organisms,\n\n00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:26.998\nand we rely on them to feed\nall the mouths of human civilization.\n\n00:06:28.118 --> 00:06:31.534\nNature does stuff like this already,\n\n00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.094\nwithout our help.\n\n00:06:33.118 --> 00:06:36.198\nWe have simply found\nmore precise ways to do it.\n\n00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:40.918\nSo why would we want to change\nthe genetic makeup of plants for space?\n\n00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:45.654\nWell, to not do so\nwould mean needing to engineer\n\n00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:49.094\nendless acres of land\non an entirely new planet\n\n00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:52.614\nby releasing trillions of gallons\nof atmospheric gasses\n\n00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:55.678\nand then constructing\na giant glass dome to contain it all.\n\n00:06:56.438 --> 00:06:58.494\nIt's an unrealistic engineering enterprise\n\n00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.038\nthat quickly becomes\na high-cost cargo transport mission.\n\n00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:04.654\nOne of the best ways to ensure\n\n00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:07.774\nthat we will have the food supplies\nand the air that we need\n\n00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:10.894\nis to bring with us organisms\nthat have been engineered\n\n00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:13.478\nto adapt to new and harsh environments.\n\n00:07:14.718 --> 00:07:18.694\nIn essence, using engineered organisms\nto help us terraform a planet\n\n00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:20.758\nboth in the short and long term.\n\n00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:26.358\nThese organisms can then also\nbe engineered to make medicine or fuel.\n\n00:07:27.878 --> 00:07:31.614\nSo we can use synthetic biology\nto bring highly engineered plants with us,\n\n00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:32.878\nbut what else can we do?\n\n00:07:33.838 --> 00:07:36.694\nWell, I mentioned earlier\nthat we, as a species,\n\n00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:39.038\nwere evolved uniquely for planet Earth.\n\n00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:42.374\nThat fact has not changed much\nin the last five minutes\n\n00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:44.838\nthat you were sitting here\nand I was standing there.\n\n00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:49.134\nAnd so, if we were to dump\nany of us on Mars right this minute,\n\n00:07:49.158 --> 00:07:52.654\neven given ample food, water, air\n\n00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:53.894\nand a suit,\n\n00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:57.294\nwe are likely to experience\nvery unpleasant health problems\n\n00:07:57.318 --> 00:08:00.614\nfrom the amount of ionizing radiation\nthat bombards the surface\n\n00:08:00.638 --> 00:08:04.478\nof planets like Mars that have little\nor nonexistent atmosphere.\n\n00:08:05.238 --> 00:08:07.254\nUnless we plan\nto stay holed up underground\n\n00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.918\nfor the duration of our stay\non every new planet,\n\n00:08:10.438 --> 00:08:13.014\nwe must find better ways\nof protecting ourselves\n\n00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:15.694\nwithout needing to resort\nto wearing a suit of armor\n\n00:08:15.718 --> 00:08:18.174\nthat weighs something\nequal to your own body weight,\n\n00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:20.478\nor needing to hide behind a wall of lead.\n\n00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:24.798\nSo let us appeal\nto nature for inspiration.\n\n00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:28.254\nAmong the plethora of life here on Earth,\n\n00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:31.134\nthere's a subset of organisms\nknown as extremophiles,\n\n00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:33.134\nor lovers of extreme living conditions,\n\n00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:35.614\nif you'll remember\nfrom high school biology.\n\n00:08:35.638 --> 00:08:40.118\nAnd among these organisms is a bacterium\nby the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.\n\n00:08:40.998 --> 00:08:46.374\nIt is known to be able to withstand cold,\ndehydration, vacuum, acid,\n\n00:08:46.398 --> 00:08:48.598\nand, most notably, radiation.\n\n00:08:49.398 --> 00:08:52.093\nWhile its radiation\ntolerance mechanisms are known,\n\n00:08:52.117 --> 00:08:54.517\nwe have yet to adapt\nthe relevant genes to mammals.\n\n00:08:55.478 --> 00:08:58.094\nTo do so is not particularly easy.\n\n00:08:58.118 --> 00:09:00.934\nThere are many facets\nthat go into its radiation tolerance,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.198\nand it's not as simple\nas transferring one gene.\n\n00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:07.174\nBut given a little bit of human ingenuity\n\n00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:08.454\nand a little bit of time,\n\n00:09:08.478 --> 00:09:10.918\nI think to do so is not very hard either.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:17.718\nEven if we borrow just a fraction\nof its ability to tolerate radiation,\n\n00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:21.374\nit would be infinitely better\nthan what we already have,\n\n00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:23.358\nwhich is just the melanin in our skin.\n\n00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:26.534\nUsing the tools of synthetic biology,\n\n00:09:26.558 --> 00:09:29.574\nwe can harness Deinococcus\nradiodurans' ability\n\n00:09:29.598 --> 00:09:33.318\nto thrive under otherwise\nvery lethal doses of radiation.\n\n00:09:35.718 --> 00:09:37.198\nAs difficult as it is to see,\n\n00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:40.198\nhomo sapiens, that is humans,\n\n00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:43.454\nevolves every day,\n\n00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:45.398\nand still continues to evolve.\n\n00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:48.094\nThousands of years of human evolution\n\n00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:51.094\nhas not only given us\nhumans like Tibetans,\n\n00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:53.694\nwho can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,\n\n00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:58.654\nbut also Argentinians,\nwho can ingest and metabolize arsenic,\n\n00:09:58.678 --> 00:10:01.478\nthe chemical element\nthat can kill the average human being.\n\n00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.014\nEvery day, the human body evolves\nby accidental mutations\n\n00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.894\nthat equally accidentally\nallow certain humans\n\n00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:11.158\nto persevere in dismal situations.\n\n00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:13.998\nBut, and this is a big but,\n\n00:10:15.438 --> 00:10:19.614\nsuch evolution requires two things\nthat we may not always have,\n\n00:10:19.638 --> 00:10:21.078\nor be able to afford,\n\n00:10:22.078 --> 00:10:24.318\nand they are death and time.\n\n00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:28.534\nIn our species' struggle\nto find our

Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing.Consider Facit. I'm actually old enough to remember them. Facit was a fantastic company. They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world. Everybody used them. And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along? They continued doing exactly the same. In six months, they went from maximum revenue ... and they were gone. Gone.To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators.(Laughter)Facit did too much exploitation. But exploration can go wild, too.A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company. Let's call them OncoSearch. The company was brilliant. They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer. Every day was about creating something new. They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, \"When we only get it right,\" or even, \"We want it perfect.\" The sad thing is, before they became perfect \u2014 even good enough \u2014 they became obsolete. OncoSearch did too much exploration.I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The founder of the idea is Jim March. And to me the power of the idea is its practicality.Exploration. Exploration is about coming up with what's new. It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations. It's about changing our frontiers. Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc. I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be. We all know that exploration is risky. We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high.Exploitation is the opposite. Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better. Exploitation is about making our trains run on time. It's about making good products faster and cheaper. Exploitation is not risky \u2014 in the short term. But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term. And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic. That's the risk of exploitation.So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore. If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit. Small children, they explore all day. All day it's about exploration. As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on. The same goes for companies. Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent.And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs. And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways. For example, \"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?\" Or, \"How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?\" So, doing one well is difficult. Doing both well as the same time is art \u2014 pushing both exploration and exploitation.So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel. But when they do, the payoffs are huge. So we have lots of great examples. We have Nestl\u00e9 creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability \u2014 there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.Why is balancing so difficult? I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are. So I'll talk about two, but there are many.So let's talk about the perpetual search trap. We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work. So instead of staying with it, we create something new. But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated. OncoSearch was a good example. A famous example is, of course, Xerox. But we don't only see this in companies. We see this in the public sector as well. We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work. But still, we change much more often. We really don't give them the chance.Another trap is the success trap. Facit fell into the success trap. They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it. They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change. We are like that, too. When we know something well, it's difficult to change. Bill Gates has said: \"Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail.\" That's the challenge with success.So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us. And they apply to our companies. The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis. And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future. Netflix \u2014 they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always \u2014 and I think they will always \u2014 keep pushing for the next battle. I see other companies that say, \"I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes.\"Second one: think in multiple time scales. I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one. Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent. So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important. Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company \u2014 suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent. But companies can't choose. They need to fund the journey and lead the long term.Third: invite talent. I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves. I think it's a team sport. I think we need to allow challenging. I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge. I think that's also what good parenting is about.Last one: be skeptical of success. Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration. Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, \"Remember, you're only human.\"So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff. But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful. First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot? And what can you do to challenge?Second question is: When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me? Is that something I should do more of? In my case, yes.So let me leave you with this. Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2470, "subtitle":

00:04:30.441\nas they become more competent.\n\n00:04:31.197 --> 00:04:34.451\nAnd this is, of course,\na big worry to CEOs.\n\n00:04:35.368 --> 00:04:39.877\nAnd I hear very often questions\nphrased in different ways.\n\n00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:41.059\nFor example,\n\n00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:45.631\n\"How can I both effectively run\nand reinvent my company?\"\n\n00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:48.409\nOr, \"How can I make sure\n\n00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:52.794\nthat our company changes\nbefore we become obsolete\n\n00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:54.432\nor are hit by a crisis?\"\n\n00:04:55.542 -->

traps\n\n00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:47.108\nthat keep us where we are.\n\n00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:50.296\nSo I'll talk about two,\nbut there are many.\n\n00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:54.044\nSo let's talk about\nthe perpetual search trap.\n\n00:05:54.574 --> 00:05:56.386\nWe discover something,\n\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.265\nbut we don't have the patience\nor the persistence\n\n00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.617\nto get at it and make it work.\n\n00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:04.786\nSo instead of staying with it,\nwe create something new.\n\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.110\nBut the same goes for that,\n\n00:06:06.134 --> 00:06:07.885\nthen we're in the vicious circle\n\n00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.221\nof actually coming up with ideas\nbut being frustrated.\n\n00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.659\nOncoSearch was a good example.\n\n00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:17.506\nA famous example is, of course, Xerox.\n\n00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:20.665\nBut we don't only see this in companies.\n\n00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.203\nWe see this in the public sector as well.\n\n00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:29.406\nWe all know that any kind\nof effective reform of education,\n\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.857\nresearch, health care, even defense,\n\n00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:35.284\ntakes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.\n\n00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:38.536\nBut still, we change much more often.\n\n00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:40.933\nWe really don't give them the chance.\n\n00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:45.402\nAnother trap is the success trap.\n\n00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:49.513\nFacit fell into the success trap.\n\n00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:53.483\nThey literally held\nthe future in their hands,\n\n00:06:53.507 --> 00:06:54.721\nbut they couldn't see it.\n\n00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:58.500\nThey were simply so good\nat making what they loved doing,\n\n00:06:58.524 --> 00:07:00.190\nthat they wouldn't change.\n\n00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:02.438\nWe are like that, too.\n\n00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:05.209\nWhen we know something well,\nit's difficult to change.\n\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.128\nBill Gates has said:\n\n00:07:08.974 --> 00:07:11.974\n\"Success is a lousy teacher.\n\n00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:15.572\nIt seduces us into thinking\nwe cannot fail.\"\n\n00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:18.325\nThat's the challenge with success.\n\n00:07:19.844 --> 00:07:23.298\nSo I think there are some lessons,\nand I think they apply to us.\n\n00:07:23.322 --> 00:07:25.063\nAnd they apply to our companies.\n\n00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:28.918\nThe first lesson is:\nget ahead of the crisis.\n\n00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:32.476\nAnd any company that's able to innovate\n\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.296\nis actually able to also buy\nan insurance in the future.\n\n00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:39.530\nNetflix -- they could so easily\nhave been content\n\n00:07:39.554 --> 00:07:42.418\nwith earlier generations of distribution,\n\n00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:44.999\nbut they always -- and I think\nthey will always --\n\n00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:46.998\nkeep pushing for the next battle.\n\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.895\nI see other companies that say,\n\n00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.360\n\"I'll win the next innovation cycle,\nwhatever it takes.\"\n\n00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:58.475\nSecond one: think in multiple time scales.\n\n00:07:58.876 --> 00:08:00.214\nI'll share a chart with you,\n\n00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:02.096\nand I think it's a wonderful one.\n\n00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:04.132\nAny company we look at,\n\n00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:05.955\ntaking a one-year perspective\n\n00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:08.256\nand looking at the valuation\nof the company,\n\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.659\ninnovation typically accounts\nfor only about 30 percent.\n\n00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:13.532\nSo when we think one year,\n\n00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:15.838\ninnovation isn't really that important.\n\n00:08:16.448 --> 00:08:20.016\nMove ahead, take a 10-year perspective\non the same company --\n\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.218\nsuddenly, innovation and ability\nto renew account for 70 percent.\n\n00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:27.688\nBut companies can't choose.\n\n00:08:27.712 --> 00:08:31.618\nThey need to fund the journey\nand lead the long term.\n\n00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:33.880\nThird:\n\n00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:35.499\ninvite talent.\n\n00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.480\nI don't think it's possible for any of us\n\n00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:43.034\nto be able to balance exploration\nand exploitation by ourselves.\n\n00:08:43.058 --> 00:08:44.764\nI think it's a team sport.\n\n00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:47.177\nI think we need to allow challenging.\n\n00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:53.121\nI think the mark of a great company\nis being open to be challenged,\n\n00:08:53.145 --> 00:08:57.368\nand the mark of a good corporate board\nis to constructively challenge.\n\n00:08:58.222 --> 00:09:01.828\nI think that's also what\ngood parenting is about.\n\n00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:05.297\nLast one: be skeptical of success.\n\n00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:12.424\nMaybe it's useful to think back\nat the old triumph marches in Rome,\n\n00:09:12.448 --> 00:09:15.944\nwhen the generals, after a big victory,\n\n00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:18.319\nwere given their celebration.\n\n00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:21.447\nRiding into Rome on the carriage,\n\n00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:25.693\nthey always had a companion\nwhispering in their ear,\n\n00:09:25.717 --> 00:09:28.203\n\"Remember, you're only human.\"\n\n00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:32.635\nSo I hope I made the point:\n\n00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:35.681\nbalancing exploration and exploitation\n\n00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:37.152\nhas a huge payoff.\n\n00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:39.737\nBut it's difficult,\nand we need to be conscious.\n\n00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:44.741\nI want to just point out two questions\nthat I think are useful.\n\n00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:48.759\nFirst question is,\nlooking at your own company:\n\n00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:53.714\nIn which areas do you see\nthat the company is at the risk\n\n00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:55.982\nof falling into success traps,\n\n00:09:56.006 --> 00:09:58.537\nof just going on autopilot?\n\n00:09:59.063 --> 00:10:02.244\nAnd what can you do to challenge?\n\n00:10:03.597 --> 00:10:05.200\nSecond question is:\n\n00:10:06.488 --> 00:10:09.749\nWhen did I explore something new last,\n\n00:10:09.773 --> 00:10:12.026\nand what kind of effect did it have on me?\n\n00:10:12.772 --> 00:10:14.986\nIs that something I should do more of?\n\n00:10:15.554 --> 00:10:16.803\nIn my case, yes.\n\n00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:20.626\nSo let me leave you with this.\n\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.931\nWhether you're an explorer by nature\n\n00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:27.857\nor whether you tend to exploit\nwhat you already know,\n\n00:10:27.881 --> 00:10:31.965\ndon't forget: the beauty\nis in the balance.\n\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.510\nThank you.\n\n00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:37.155\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The surprising habits of original thinkers", "duration": "925", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers", "transcript": "Seven years ago, a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company. He said, \"I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online.\" And I said, \"OK, you guys spent the whole summer on this, right?\" \"No, we all took internships just in case it doesn't work out.\" \"All right, but you're going to go in full time once you graduate.\" \"Not exactly. We've all lined up backup jobs.\" Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still not a functioning website. \"You guys realize, the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is.\" So I obviously declined to invest.And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker.(Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong?To find out, I've been studying people that I come to call \"originals.\" Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them.So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you. I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that a few months ahead of time.(Laughter)So this started early: when I was a kid, I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo, starring me.(Laughter)(Applause)Since then, I have traded hair for teeth.(Laughter)But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that, until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said, \"I have my most creative ideas when I'm procrastinating.\" And I was like, \"That's cute, where are the four papers you owe me?\"(Laughter)No, she was one of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist, this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough, the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, \"I don't know. They didn't fill out my survey.\"(Laughter)No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side, the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are. And some of them are asked to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome, but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps.So just as we were finishing these experiments, I was starting to write a book about originals, and I thought, \"This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter on procrastination.\" So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate.(Laughter)And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal. I started writing the procrastination chapter, and one day \u2014 I was halfway through \u2014 I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, \"You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking.\" And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history: \"I have a dream.\" That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise.Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed with Warby Parker. When they were dragging their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, \"You know, a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online.\" They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better. What you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent for the improvers. Look at Facebook, waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea than it is to create something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better.But that wasn't the only reason I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals would look something like this.(Laughter)Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us.(Laughter)Now, in my research, I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four. Instead of saying, \"I'm crap,\" you say, \"The first few drafts are always crap, and I'm just not there yet.\" So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not going to like the results of this study \u2014(Laughter)But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes.(Applause)They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default and ask, is there a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser. So people hear about this study and they're like, \"Great, if I want to get better at my job, I just need to upgrade my browser?\"(Laughter)No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up to the opposite of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. There's a name for it. It's called vuja de.(Laughter)Vuja de is when you look at something you've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light for more than half a century. In every past version, the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message from this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go.(Laughter)What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they're even more afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science, are the chances not taken.Elon Musk told me recently, he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit, let alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us, when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea, their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb.(Laughter)If you look across fields, the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers, the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out, the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music \u2014 Bach, Beethoven, Mozart \u2014 had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us, if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas.The Warby Parker founders, when they were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated, unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together, what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed.So when you see those things, don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you, don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way to improve the world around us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2474, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:17.494\nSeven years ago, a student came to me\nand asked me to invest in his company.\n\n00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.494\nHe said, \"I'm working with three friends,\n\n00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.958\nand we're going to try to disrupt\nan industry by selling stuff online.\"\n\n00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:26.654\nAnd I said, \"OK, you guys spent\nthe whole summer on this, right?\"\n\n00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:29.814\n\"No, we all took internships\njust in case it doesn't work out.\"\n\n00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:32.998\n\"All right, but you're going to\ngo in full time once you graduate.\"\n\n00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:36.678\n\"Not exactly. We've all\nlined up backup jobs.\"\n\n00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:38.814\nSix months go by,\n\n00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.814\nit's the day before the company launches,\n\n00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:42.958\nand there is still\nnot a functioning website.\n\n00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:45.774\n\"You guys realize,\nthe entire company is a website.\n\n00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:47.158\nThat's literally all it is.\"\n\n00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:52.398\nSo I obviously declined to invest.\n\n00:00:53.478 --> 00:00:55.854\nAnd they ended up\nnaming the company Warby Parker.\n\n00:00:55.878 --> 00:00:57.494\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:57.518 --> 00:00:59.278\nThey sell glasses online.\n\n00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:03.654\nThey were recently recognized\nas the world's most innovative company\n\n00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:05.694\nand valued at over a billion dollars.\n\n00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:09.038\nAnd now? My wife handles our investments.\n\n00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.478\nWhy was I so wrong?\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.638\nTo find out, I've been studying people\nthat I come to call \"originals.\"\n\n00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:18.974\nOriginals are nonconformists,\n\n00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:21.414\npeople who not only have new ideas\n\n00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:23.278\nbut take action to champion them.\n\n00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:26.414\nThey are people\nwho stand out and speak up.\n\n00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:29.374\nOriginals drive creativity\nand change in the world.\n\n00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:31.534\nThey're the people you want to bet on.\n\n00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd they look nothing like I expected.\n\n00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:37.134\nI want to show you today\nthree things I've learned\n\n00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:39.174\nabout recognizing originals\n\n00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.598\nand becoming a little bit more like them.\n\n00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:45.734\nSo the first reason\nthat I passed on Warby Parker\n\n00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:48.518\nwas they were really slow\ngetting off the ground.\n\n00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:53.318\nNow, you are all intimately familiar\nwith the mind of a procrastinator.\n\n00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:58.558\nWell, I have a confession for you.\nI'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.\n\n00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.414\nYes, that's an actual term.\n\n00:02:01.438 --> 00:02:04.374\nYou know that panic you feel\na few hours before a big deadline\n\n00:02:04.398 --> 00:02:06.318\nwhen you haven't done anything yet.\n\n00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:09.054\nI just feel that\na few months ahead of time.\n\n00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:11.118\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:18.534\nSo this started early: when I was a kid,\nI took Nintendo games very seriously.\n\n00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:20.574\nI would wake up at 5am,\n\n00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:23.398\nstart playing and not stop\nuntil I had mastered them.\n\n00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.774\nEventually it got so out of hand\nthat a local newspaper came\n\n00:02:27.798 --> 00:02:31.774\nand did a story on the dark side\nof Nintendo, starring me.\n\n00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:34.654\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:34.678 --> 00:02:37.438\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:41.398 --> 00:02:44.374\nSince then, I have traded hair for teeth.\n\n00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:47.038\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.974\nBut this served me well in college,\n\n00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:56.838\nbecause I finished my senior thesis\nfour months before the deadline.\n\n00:02:58.118 --> 00:03:01.774\nAnd I was proud of that,\nuntil a few years ago.\n\n00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.814\nI had a student named Jihae,\nwho came to me and said,\n\n00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:08.718\n\"I have my most creative ideas\nwhen I'm procrastinating.\"\n\n00:03:09.318 --> 00:03:12.534\nAnd I was like, \"That's cute,\nwhere are the four papers you owe me?\"\n\n00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.654\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:13.678 --> 00:03:15.854\nNo, she was one\nof our most creative students,\n\n00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:20.134\nand as an organizational psychologist,\nthis is the kind of idea that I test.\n\n00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.174\nSo I challenged her to get some data.\n\n00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:23.894\nShe goes into a bunch of companies.\n\n00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:27.334\nShe has people fill out surveys\nabout how often they procrastinate.\n\n00:03:27.358 --> 00:03:30.974\nThen she gets their bosses to rate\nhow creative and innovative they are.\n\n00:03:30.998 --> 00:03:33.854\nAnd sure enough,\nthe precrastinators like me,\n\n00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:35.814\nwho rush in and do everything early\n\n00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:37.574\nare rated as less creative\n\n00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:39.558\nthan people who procrastinate moderately.\n\n00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.614\nSo I want to know what happens\nto the chronic procrastinators.\n\n00:03:43.638 --> 00:03:46.534\nShe was like, \"I don't know.\nThey didn't fill out my survey.\"\n\n00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:49.054\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:51.038\nNo, here are our results.\n\n00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:55.774\nYou actually do see that the people\nwho wait until the last minute\n\n00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:59.518\nare so busy goofing off\nthat they don't have any new ideas.\n\n00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:03.854\nAnd on the flip side,\nthe people who race in\n\n00:04:03.878 --> 00:04:07.798\nare in such a frenzy of anxiety that they\ndon't have original thoughts either.\n\n00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:12.678\nThere's a sweet spot\nwhere originals seem to live.\n\n00:04:13.838 --> 00:04:15.038\nWhy is this?\n\n00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:18.374\nMaybe original people\njust have bad work habits.\n\n00:04:18.398 --> 00:04:21.518\nMaybe procrastinating\ndoes not cause creativity.\n\n00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:25.374\nTo find out, we designed some experiments.\n\n00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.213\nWe asked people\nto generate new business ideas,\n\n00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:29.934\nand then we get independent readers\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.134\nto evaluate how creative\nand useful they are.\n\n00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:36.574\nAnd some of them are asked\nto do the task right away.\n\n00:04:36.598 --> 00:04:39.134\nOthers we randomly assign\nto procrastinate\n\n00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:41.158\nby dangling Minesweeper in front of them\n\n00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:43.854\nfor either five or 10 minutes.\n\n00:04:43.878 --> 00:04:47.014\nAnd sure enough,\nthe moderate procrastinators\n\n00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:50.718\nare 16 percent more creative\nthan the other two groups.\n\n00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:54.734\nNow, Minesweeper is awesome,\nbut it's not the driver of the effect,\n\n00:04:54.758 --> 00:04:57.934\nbecause if you play the game first\nbefore you learn about the task,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.614\nthere's no creativity boost.\n\n00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:03.174\nIt's only when you're told that you're\ngoing to be working on this problem,\n\n00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:04.894\nand then you start procrastinating,\n\n00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:07.454\nbut the task is still active\nin the back of your mind,\n\n00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:08.974\nthat you start to incubate.\n\n00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:12.574\nProcrastination gives you time\nto consider divergent ideas,\n\n00:05:12.598 --> 00:05:15.718\nto think in nonlinear ways,\nto make unexpected leaps.\n\n00:05:16.678 --> 00:05:18.894\nSo just as we were finishing\nthese experiments,\n\n00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:21.414\nI was starting to write\na book about originals,\n\n00:05:21.438 --> 00:05:25.974\nand I thought, \"This is the perfect time\nto teach myself to procrastinate,\n\n00:05:25.998 --> 00:05:28.078\nwhile writing a chapter\non procrastination.\"\n\n00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:30.078\nSo I metaprocrastinated,\n\n00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:35.454\nand like any self-respecting\nprecrastinator,\n\n00:05:35.478 --> 00:05:37.054\nI woke up early the next morning\n\n00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:39.894\nand I made a to-do list\nwith steps on how to procrastinate.\n\n00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:42.438\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:47.014\nAnd then I worked diligently\n\n00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:50.678\ntoward my goal of not making\nprogress toward my goal.\n\n00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.294\nI started writing\nthe procrastination chapter,\n\n00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:56.214\nand one day -- I was halfway through --\n\n00:05:56.238 --> 00:05:58.134\nI literally put it away in mid-sentence\n\n00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:59.494\nfor months.\n\n00:05:59.518 --> 00:06:01.518\nIt was agony.\n\n00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:05.558\nBut when I came back to it,\nI had all sorts of new ideas.\n\n00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:07.854\nAs Aaron Sorkin put it,\n\n00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:10.838\n\"You call it procrastinating.\nI call it thinking.\"\n\n00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:13.614\nAnd along the way I discovered\n\n00:06:13.638 --> 00:06:16.918\nthat a lot of great originals\nin history were procrastinators.\n\n00:06:17.638 --> 00:06:19.414\nTake Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n00:06:19.438 --> 00:06:22.974\nHe toiled on and off for 16 years\n\n00:06:22.998 --> 00:06:24.774\non the Mona Lisa.\n\n00:06:24.798 --> 00:06:26.214\nHe felt like a failure.\n\n00:06:26.238 --> 00:06:28.038\nHe wrote as much in his journal.\n\n00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:32.774\nBut some of the diversions\nhe took in optics\n\n00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:34.774\ntransformed the way that he modeled light\n\n00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:36.718\nand made him into a much better painter.\n\n00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:39.478\nWhat about Martin Luther King, Jr.?\n\n00:06:40.438 --> 00:06:42.694\nThe night before\nthe biggest speech of his life,\n\n00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:43.974\nthe March on Washington,\n\n00:06:43.998 --> 00:06:46.118\nhe was up past 3am, rewriting it.\n\n00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:50.174\nHe's sitting in the audience\nwaiting for his turn to go onstage,\n\n00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:53.998\nand he is still scribbling notes\nand crossing out lines.\n\n00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:56.774\nWhen he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,\n\n00:06:56.798 --> 00:06:58.734\nhe leaves his prepared remarks\n\n00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:01.894\nto utter four words\nthat changed the course of history:\n\n00:07:01.918 --> 00:07:03.198\n\"I have a dream.\"\n\n00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:06.118\nThat was not in the script.\n\n00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:11.694\nBy delaying the task of finalizing\nthe speech until the very last minute,\n\n00:07:11.718 --> 00:07:15.454\nhe left himself open\nto the widest range of possible ideas.\n\n00:07:15.478 --> 00:07:17.734\nAnd because the text wasn't set in stone,\n\n00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:19.798\nhe had freedom to improvise.\n\n00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:23.774\nProcrastinating is a vice\nwhen it comes to productivity,\n\n00:07:23.798 --> 00:07:26.638\nbut it can be a virtue for creativity.\n\n00:07:27.358 --> 00:07:29.374\nWhat you see with a lot of great originals\n\n00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:33.014\nis that they are quick to start\nbut they're slow to finish.\n\n00:07:33.038 --> 00:07:35.118\nAnd this is what I missed\nwith Warby Parker.\n\n00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:38.334\nWhen they were dragging\ntheir heels for six months,\n\n00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:39.974\nI looked at them and said,\n\n00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:43.454\n\"You know, a lot of other companies\nare starting to sell glasses online.\"\n\n00:07:43.478 --> 00:07:45.318\nThey missed the first-mover advantage.\n\n00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:49.094\nBut what I didn't realize was\nthey were spending all that time\n\n00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:50.974\ntrying to figure out how to get people\n\n00:07:50.998 --> 00:07:52.998\nto be comfortable ordering glasses online.\n\n00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:56.014\nAnd it turns out the first-mover\nadvantage is mostly a myth.\n\n00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.854\nLook at a classic study\nof over 50 product categories,\n\n00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:02.374\ncomparing the first movers\nwho created the market\n\n00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:05.838\nwith the improvers who introduced\nsomething different and better.\n\n00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:10.854\nWhat you see is that the first movers\nhad a failure rate of 47 percent,\n\n00:08:10.878 --> 00:08:14.158\ncompared with only 8 percent\nfor the improvers.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.494\nLook at Facebook,\nwaiting to build a social network\n\n00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:20.974\nuntil after Myspace and Friendster.\n\n00:08:20.998 --> 00:08:24.774\nLook at Google, waiting for years\nafter Altavista and Yahoo.\n\n00:08:24.798 --> 00:08:27.894\nIt's much easier to improve\non somebody else's idea\n\n00:08:27.918 --> 00:08:30.158\nthan it is to create\nsomething new from scratch.\n\n00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:34.934\nSo the lesson I learned is that\nto be original you don't have to be first.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.158\nYou just have to be different and better.\n\n00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:41.294\nBut that wasn't the only reason\nI passed on Warby Parker.\n\n00:08:41.318 --> 00:08:43.734\nThey were also full of doubts.\n\n00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:45.574\nThey had backup plans lined up,\n\n00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:49.014\nand that made me doubt\nthat they had the courage to be original,\n\n00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:53.718\nbecause I expected that originals\nwould look something like this.\n\n00:08:54.997 --> 00:08:57.318\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.254\nNow, on the surface,\n\n00:09:00.278 --> 00:09:02.254\na lot of original people look confident,\n\n00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:03.534\nbut behind the scenes,\n\n00:09:03.558 --> 00:09:06.574\nthey feel the same fear and doubt\nthat the rest of us do.\n\n00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:08.158\nThey just manage it differently.\n\n00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.534\nLet me show you: this is a depiction\n\n00:09:10.558 --> 00:09:12.878\nof how the creative process\nworks for most of us.\n\n00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:18.078\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:20.118 --> 00:09:23.574\nNow, in my research, I discovered\nthere are two different kinds of doubt.\n\n00:09:23.598 --> 00:09:25.254\nThere's self-doubt and idea doubt.\n\n00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:26.814\nSelf-doubt is paralyzing.\n\n00:09:26.838 --> 00:09:28.454\nIt leads you to freeze.\n\n00:09:28.478 --> 00:09:30.214\nBut idea doubt is energizing.\n\n00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:33.014\nIt motivates you to test,\nto experiment, to refine,\n\n00:09:33.038 --> 00:09:35.094\njust like MLK did.\n\n00:09:35.118 --> 00:09:38.374\nAnd so the key to being original\n\n00:09:38.398 --> 00:09:40.134\nis just a simple thing\n\n00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:43.534\nof avoiding the leap\nfrom step three to step four.\n\n00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:45.374\nInstead of saying, \"I'm crap,\"\n\n00:09:45.398 --> 00:09:47.878\nyou say, \"The first few drafts\nare always crap,\n\n00:09:48.638 --> 00:09:50.038\nand I'm just not there yet.\"\n\n00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:52.494\nSo how do you get there?\n\n00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:54.414\nWell, there's a clue, it turns out,\n\n00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:56.398\nin the Internet browser that you use.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.574\nWe can predict your job performance\nand your commitment\n\n00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:02.438\njust by knowing what web browser you use.\n\n00:10:03.398 --> 00:10:06.574\nNow, some of you are not\ngoing to like the results of this study --\n\n00:10:06.598 --> 00:10:07.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.894\nBut there is good evidence\nthat Firefox and Chrome users\n\n00:10:11.918 --> 00:10:15.278\nsignificantly outperform\nInternet Explorer and Safari users.\n\n00:10:15.918 --> 00:10:17.254\nYes.\n\n00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:19.134\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:19.158 --> 00:10:22.118\nThey also stay in their jobs\n15 percent longer, by the way.\n\n00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:25.254\nWhy? It's not a technical advantage.\n\n00:10:25.278 --> 00:10:28.654\nThe four browser groups\non average have similar typing speed\n\n00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:31.814\nand they also have similar levels\nof computer knowledge.\n\n00:10:31.838 --> 00:10:33.934\nIt's about how you got the browser.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.414\nBecause if you use\nInternet Explorer or Safari,\n\n00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:38.974\nthose came preinstalled on your computer,\n\n00:10:38.998 --> 00:10:41.798\nand you accepted the default option\nthat was handed to you.\n\n00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:45.574\nIf you wanted Firefox or Chrome,\nyou had to doubt the default\n\n00:10:45.598 --> 00:10:47.854\nand ask, is there\na different option out there,\n\n00:10:47.878 --> 00:10:50.838\nand then be a little resourceful\nand download a new browser.\n\n00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:54.054\nSo people hear about this study\nand they're like,\n\n00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:57.774\n\"Great, if I want to get better at my job,\nI just need to upgrade my browser?\"\n\n00:10:57.798 --> 00:10:58.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:00.934\nNo, it's about being the kind of person\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.374\nwho takes the initiative\nto doubt the default\n\n00:11:03.398 --> 00:11:05.534\nand look for a better option.\n\n00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:07.054\nAnd if you do that well,\n\n00:11:07.078 --> 00:11:09.878\nyou will open yourself up\nto the opposite of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\n00:11:10.558 --> 00:11:13.694\nThere's a name for it.\nIt's called vuja de.\n\n00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:15.718\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:16.758 --> 00:11:19.934\nVuja de is when you look at something\nyou've seen many times before\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.718\nand all of a sudden\nsee it with fresh eyes.\n\n00:11:23.878 --> 00:11:26.494\nIt's a screenwriter\nwho looks at a movie script\n\n00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:29.494\nthat can't get the green light\nfor more than half a century.\n\n00:11:29.518 --> 00:11:33.718\nIn every past version,\nthe main character has been an evil queen.\n\n00:11:34.238 --> 00:11:37.374\nBut Jennifer Lee starts to question\nwhether that makes sense.\n\n00:11:37.398 --> 00:11:38.854\nShe rewrites the first act,\n\n00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:41.494\nreinvents the villain as a tortured hero\n\n00:11:41.518 --> 00:11:44.478\nand Frozen becomes\nthe most successful animated movie ever.\n\n00:11:45.558 --> 00:11:47.654\nSo there's a simple message\nfrom this story.\n\n00:11:47.678 --> 00:11:50.278\nWhen you feel doubt, don't let it go.\n\n00:11:50.638 --> 00:11:52.918\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:53.598 --> 00:11:54.934\nWhat about fear?\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.878\nOriginals feel fear, too.\n\n00:11:57.558 --> 00:11:59.414\nThey're afraid of failing,\n\n00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:01.534\nbut what sets them apart\nfrom the rest of us\n\n00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:04.174\nis that they're even more\nafraid of failing to try.\n\n00:12:04.198 --> 00:12:07.294\nThey know you can fail\nby starting a business that goes bankrupt\n\n00:12:07.318 --> 00:12:09.758\nor by failing to start a business at all.\n\n00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:13.974\nThey know that in the long run,\nour biggest regrets are not our actions\n\n00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:15.654\nbut our inactions.\n\n00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:18.536\nThe things we wish we could redo,\nif you look at the science,\n\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.760\nare the chances not taken.\n\n00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:25.334\nElon Musk told me recently,\nhe didn't expect Tesla to succeed.\n\n00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:28.094\nHe was sure the first few SpaceX launches\n\n00:12:28.118 --> 00:12:31.294\nwould fail to make it to orbit,\nlet alone get back,\n\n00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.518\nbut it was too important not to try.\n\n00:12:34.318 --> 00:12:36.854\nAnd for so many of us,\nwhen we have an important idea,\n\n00:12:36.878 --> 00:12:38.118\nwe don't bother to try.\n\n00:12:38.918 --> 00:12:40.974\nBut I have some good news for you.\n\n00:12:40.998 --> 00:12:43.574\nYou are not going to get judged\non your bad ideas.\n\n00:12:43.598 --> 00:12:45.214\nA lot of people think they will.\n\n00:12:45.238 --> 00:12:46.894\nIf you look across industries\n\n00:12:46.918 --> 00:12:50.347\nand ask people about their biggest idea,\ntheir most important suggestion,\n\n00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:54.678\n85 percent of them stayed silent\ninstead of speaking up.\n\n00:12:55.198 --> 00:12:58.614\nThey were afraid of embarrassing\nthemselves, of looking stupid.\n\n00:12:58.638 --> 00:13:02.054\nBut guess what?

It's a story about a living, breathing start-up flourishing in an unlikely environment: the United States government. Now, this start-up is fundamentally beginning to disrupt the way government does business from the inside out. But before I get there, let's start with the problem.For me, the problem begins with a number: 137. 137 is the average number of days a veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the VA. 137 days. Now, in order to file that application in the first place, she has to navigate over 1,000 different websites and over 900 different call-in numbers, all owned and operated by the United States government.Now, we live in times of incredible change. The private sector is constantly changing and improving itself all the time. For that matter, it's removing every single inconvenience in my life that I could possibly think of. I could be sitting on my couch in my apartment, and from my phone, I can order a warm, gluten-free meal that can arrive at my door in less than 10 minutes. But meanwhile, a working mother who depends on food stamps to support her family has to complete an arduous, complicated application which she might not even be able to do online. And the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means that she might be having to take days or hours off of work that she can't spare. And this growing dichotomy between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution and those it's left behind is one of the greatest challenges of our time \u2014(Applause)Because government's failure to deliver digital services that work is disproportionately impacting the very people who need it most. It's impacting the students trying to go to college, the single mothers trying to get health care, the veterans coming home from battle. They can't get what they need when they need it. And for these Americans, government is more than just a presidential election every four years. Government is a lifeline that provides services they need and depend on and deserve. Which is, quite frankly, why government needs to get its shit together and catch up. Just saying.(Applause)Now, this wasn't always a problem I was passionate about. When I joined President Obama's campaign in 2008, we brought the tech industry's best practices into politics. We earned more money, we engaged more volunteers and we earned more votes than any political campaign in history. We were a cutting-edge start-up that changed the game of politics forever. So when the President asked a small group of us to bring that very same disruption directly into government, I knew it wasn't going to be easy work, but I was eager and showed up ready to get to work.Now, on my first day in DC, my first day in government, I walked into the office and they handed me a laptop. And the laptop was running Windows 98.(Laughter)I mean, three entire presidential elections had come and gone since the government had updated the operating system on that computer. Three elections! Which is when we realized this problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined. Let me paint the picture for you.The federal government is the largest institution in the world. It spends over 86 billion dollars a year \u2014 86 billion \u2014 on federal IT projects. For context: that is more than the entire venture capital industry spends annually \u2014 on everything. Now, the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for, because 94 percent of federal IT projects are over budget or behind schedule. 94 percent! For those of you keeping score, yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.(Laughter)There's another problem: 40 percent of those never end up seeing the light of day. They are completely scrapped or abandoned. Now, this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization, because it means as government continues to operate as it's programmed to do, failure is nearly inevitable. And when the status quo is the riskiest option, that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption.So, what do we do about it? How do we fix this? Well, the irony of all of this is that we actually don't have to look any further than our backyard, because right here in America are the very ideas, the very people, who have swept our world into a radically different place than it was two decades ago. So what would it look like if it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans' benefits as it is to order cat food to my house? What would it look like if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government?Well, my friends, here's where we get to talk about some of the exciting new formulas we've discovered for creating change in government. Enter the United States Digital Service. The United States Digital Service is a new network of start-ups, a team of teams, organizing themselves across government to create radical change. The mission of the United States Digital Service is to help government deliver world-class digital services for students, immigrants, children, the elderly \u2014 everybody \u2014 at dramatically lower costs. We are essentially trying to build a more awesome government, for the people, by the people, today. We don't care \u2014 (Applause) Thank you.(Applause)Who doesn't want a more awesome government, right?We don't care about politics. We care about making government work better, because it's the only one we've got.(Applause)Now, you can think of our team \u2014 well, it's pretty funny \u2014 you can think of our team a little bit like the Peace Corps meets DARPA meets SEAL Team 6. We're like the Peace Corps for nerds, but instead of traveling to crazy, interesting, far-off places, you spend a lot of time indoors, behind computers, helping restore the fabric of our democracy.(Laughter)Now, this team \u2014 our playbook for the United States Digital Service is pretty simple. The first play is we recruit the very best talent our country has to offer, and recruit them for short tours of duty inside government. These are the very people who have helped build the products and companies that have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world. Second, we pair these incredible people from the tech core with the dedicated civil servants already inside government on the ground creating change. Third, we strategically deploy them in a targeted formation at the most mission-critical, life-changing, important services that government offers. And finally, we give them massive air cover, from the leadership inside the agencies all the way up to the President himself, to transform these services for the better.Now, this team is beginning to disrupt how government does business from the inside out. If you study classic patterns of disruption, one very common pattern is rather simple. It's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it's a radical departure from the status quo. Think about what Airbnb took that was normal from hospitality and revolutionized my apartment. The United States Digital Service is doing exactly that. We are taking what Silicon Valley and the private sector has learned through a ton of hard work about how to build planetary-scale digital services that delight users at lower cost, and we're applying that to government, where it is a radical departure from the status quo.Now, the good news is: it's starting to work. We know this because we can already see the results from some of our early projects, like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov, when that went off the rails. Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place that we ran this play, and today we are taking that same play and scaling it across a large number of government's most important citizen-facing services. Now, if I can take a moment and brag about the team for a second \u2014 it is the highest concentration of badasses I could have ever dreamed of. We have top talent from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes, all on staff today, all choosing to join their government. And what's incredible is, everybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent. And I might add, by the way, over half of us are women.(Applause)The best way to understand this strategy is actually to walk through a couple of examples of how it's working out in the wild. I'm going to give you two examples quickly.The first one is about immigration. This, my friends, is your typical immigration application. Yes, you guessed it \u2014 it's almost entirely paper-based. In the best case, the application takes about six to eight months to process. It is physically shipped thousands of miles \u2014 thousands of miles! \u2014 between no less than six processing centers. Now, little story: about a decade ago, the government thought that if it brought this system online, it could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service, which was a great idea. So, the typical government process began. Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later, no working product was delivered \u2014 1.2 billion with a \"B.\" Now at this point, the agency responsible, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, could have kept pouring money into the failing program. Sadly, that's what often happens. That's the status quo today. But they didn't. The dedicated civil servants inside the agency decided to stand up and call for change. We deployed a small team of just six people, and what many people don't know is that's the same size as the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov \u2014 just six people. And that team jumped in, side-by-side, to support the agency in transitioning this project into more modern business practices, more modern development practices. Now, in non-tech speak, what that basically means is taking big, multi-year projects and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks, so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks, instead of waiting in a black box for years.So within less than three months of our team being on the ground, we were already able to push our first products to production. The first one, this is the form I-90. This is used to file for your replacement green card. Now, for immigrant visa holders, a replacement green card is a big deal. Your green card is your proof of identification, it's your work authorization, it's the proof that you can be here in this country. So waiting six months while the government processes the replacement is not cool. I'm excited to tell you that today, you can now, for the first time, file for a replacement green card entirely online without anyone touching a piece of paper. It is faster, it is cheaper, and it's a better user experience for the applicant and the government employees alike.(Applause)Another one, quickly. Last fall, we just released a brand-new practice civics test. So as part of becoming a US citizen, you have to pass a civics test. For anyone who has taken this test, it can be quite the stressful process. So our team released a very easy, simple-to-use tool in plain language to help people prepare, to help ease their nerves, to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their American dream. Because all of this work, all of this work on immigration, is about taking complicated processes and making them more human.The other day, one of the dedicated civil servants on the ground said something incredibly profound. She said that she's never been this hopeful or optimistic about a project in her entire time in government. And she's been doing this for 30 years. That is exactly the kind of hope and culture change we are trying to create.For my second example, I want to bring it back to veterans for a second, and what we are doing to build them a VA that is worthy of their service and their sacrifice. I'm proud to say that just a few months ago, we released a brand-new beta of a new website, Vets.gov. Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website that brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place. One website, not thousands. The site is a work in progress, but it's significant progress, because it's designed with the users who matter most: the veterans themselves. This might sound incredibly obvious, because it should be, but sadly, this isn't normal for government. Far too often, product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders who do their best to represent the interests of the user, but they're not necessarily the users themselves. So our team at the VA went out, we looked at the data, we talked to veterans themselves and we started simple and small, with the two most important services that matter most to them: education benefits and disability benefits. I'm proud to say that they are live on the site today, and as the team continues to streamline more services, they will be ported over here, and the old sites, shut down.(Applause)To me, this is what change looks like in 2016.When you walk out of the Oval Office, the first time I was ever there, I noticed a quote the President had embroidered on the rug. It's the classic JFK quote. It says, \"No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.\" It's true. We have the tools to solve these problems. We have the tools to come together as a society, as a country, and to fix this together. Yes, it's hard. It's particularly hard when we have to fight, when we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things won't change. But in my experience, it's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing, because if we don't do them, who will? This is on us, all of us, together, because government is not an abstract institution or a concept. Our government is us.(Applause)Today, it is no longer a question of if change is possible. The question is not, \"Can we?\" The question is, \"Will we?\"Will you?Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2465, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.593\nI'm here to talk to you today\n\n00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:17.729\nabout a story that we have all\nbeen conditioned to believe\n\n00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:19.293\nis not possible.\n\n00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:21.615\nIt's a story about a living,\nbreathing start-up\n\n00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:24.034\nflourishing in an unlikely environment:\n\n00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:25.884\nthe United States government.\n\n00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:28.542\nNow, this start-up is fundamentally\nbeginning to disrupt\n\n00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.054\nthe way government does\nbusiness from the inside out.\n\n00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:33.578\nBut before I get there,\nlet's start with the problem.\n\n00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:37.301\nFor me, the problem begins\nwith a number: 137.\n\n00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.375\n137 is the average number of days\n\n00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.810\na veteran has to wait to have benefits\nprocessed by the VA.\n\n00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:46.966\n137 days.\n\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.745\nNow, in order to file that application\nin the first place,\n\n00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.357\nshe has to navigate\nover 1,000 different websites\n\n00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:56.174\nand over 900 different call-in numbers,\n\n00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:59.399\nall owned and operated\nby the United States government.\n\n00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:02.883\nNow, we live in times\nof incredible change.\n\n00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:05.674\nThe private sector is constantly changing\n\n00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.463\nand improving itself all the time.\n\n00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:10.925\nFor that matter, it's removing\nevery single inconvenience in my life\n\n00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:12.742\nthat I could possibly think of.\n\n00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.321\nI could be sitting on my couch\nin my apartment,\n\n00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:18.387\nand from my phone, I can order\na warm, gluten-free meal\n\n00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.390\nthat can arrive at my door\nin less than 10 minutes.\n\n00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.637\nBut meanwhile, a working mother\nwho depends on food stamps\n\n00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.722\nto support her family\n\n00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:30.885\nhas to complete an arduous,\ncomplicated application\n\n00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.370\nwhich she might not even\nbe able to do online.\n\n00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:37.536\nAnd the inability of her to do that same\nwork from her couch means\n\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.640\nthat she might be having to take\ndays or hours off of work\n\n00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:42.052\nthat she can't spare.\n\n00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.647\nAnd this growing dichotomy\n\n00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.965\nbetween the beneficiaries\nof the tech revolution\n\n00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:49.384\nand those it's left behind\n\n00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.930\nis one of the greatest\nchallenges of our time --\n\n00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:56.343\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:57.565 --> 00:02:01.820\nBecause government's failure\nto deliver digital services that work\n\n00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:06.398\nis disproportionately impacting\nthe very people who need it most.\n\n00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:09.041\nIt's impacting the students\ntrying to go to college,\n\n00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:11.119\nthe single mothers\ntrying to get health care,\n\n00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:12.920\nthe veterans coming home from battle.\n\n00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:16.016\nThey can't get what they need\nwhen they need it.\n\n00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.426\nAnd for these Americans,\n\n00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.105\ngovernment is more than just\na presidential election every four years.\n\n00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.195\nGovernment is a lifeline\nthat provides services they need\n\n00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.544\nand depend on and deserve.\n\n00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:27.735\nWhich is, quite frankly,\n\n00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.942\nwhy government needs to get\nits shit together and catch up.\n\n00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.125\nJust saying.\n\n00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.459\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:35.908 --> 00:02:38.829\nNow, this wasn't always a problem\nI was passionate about.\n\n00:02:38.853 --> 00:02:41.613\nWhen I joined President Obama's\ncampaign in 2008,\n\n00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:44.794\nwe brought the tech industry's\nbest practices into politics.\n\n00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:46.549\nWe earned more money,\n\n00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:48.294\nwe engaged more volunteers\n\n00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:51.992\nand we earned more votes\nthan any political campaign in history.\n\n00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:55.798\nWe were a cutting-edge start-up\nthat changed the game of politics forever.\n\n00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:58.081\nSo when the President asked\na small group of us\n\n00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.956\nto bring that very same disruption\ndirectly into government,\n\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.847\nI knew it wasn't going to be easy work,\n\n00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:05.629\nbut I was eager and showed up\nready to get to work.\n\n00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.399\nNow, on my first day in DC,\n\n00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.933\nmy first day in government,\n\n00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.898\nI walked into the office\nand they handed me a laptop.\n\n00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:17.382\nAnd the laptop was running Windows 98.\n\n00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:18.780\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:22.496\nI mean, three entire presidential\nelections had come and gone\n\n00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.877\nsince the government had updated\nthe operating system on that computer.\n\n00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.312\nThree elections!\n\n00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:29.596\nWhich is when we realized\n\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.684\nthis problem was a whole lot bigger\nthan we ever could have imagined.\n\n00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:35.464\nLet me paint the picture for you.\n\n00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:40.031\nThe federal government is the largest\ninstitution in the world.\n\n00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:44.627\nIt spends over 86 billion dollars\na year -- 86 billion --\n\n00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:46.304\non federal IT projects.\n\n00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:47.872\nFor context:\n\n00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:50.817\nthat is more than the entire\nventure capital industry spends\n\n00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:52.637\nannually -- on everything.\n\n00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:55.347\nNow, the problem here\n\n00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:59.482\nis that we the taxpayers\nare not getting what we pay for,\n\n00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:03.323\nbecause 94 percent of federal IT projects\n\n00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:05.562\nare over budget or behind schedule.\n\n00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:07.022\n94 percent!\n\n00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.535\nFor those of you keeping score,\n\n00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.868\nyes, the number 94 is very close to 100.\n\n00:04:10.892 --> 00:04:12.360\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.558\nThere's another problem:\n\n00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:18.346\n40 percent of those never end up\nseeing the light of day.\n\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.948\nThey are completely scrapped or abandoned.\n\n00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:25.730\nNow, this is a very existentially\npainful moment for any organization,\n\n00:04:25.754 --> 00:04:28.151\nbecause it means as government\ncontinues to operate\n\n00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:29.390\nas it's programmed to do,\n\n00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:31.029\nfailure is nearly inevitable.\n\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.904\nAnd when the status quo\nis the riskiest option,\n\n00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:36.976\nthat means there is simply no other choice\n\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.742\nthan radical disruption.\n\n00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:42.215\nSo, what do we do about it?\n\n00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:44.374\nHow do we fix this?\n\n00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:47.640\nWell, the irony of all of this\n\n00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:50.937\nis that we actually don't have to look\nany further than our backyard,\n\n00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:54.826\nbecause right here in America\nare the very ideas, the very people,\n\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.520\nwho have swept our world\ninto a radically different place\n\n00:04:57.544 --> 00:04:59.210\nthan it was two decades ago.\n\n00:04:59.234 --> 00:05:01.515\nSo what would it look like\n\n00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.879\nif it was actually as easy to get\nstudent loans or veterans' benefits\n\n00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:07.745\nas it is to order cat food to my house?\n\n00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:10.082\nWhat would it look like\n\n00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:14.519\nif there was an easy pathway\nfor the very entrepreneurs and innovators\n\n00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:16.306\nwho have disrupted our tech sector\n\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.345\nto come and disrupt their government?\n\n00:05:18.947 --> 00:05:21.077\nWell, my friends,\nhere's where we get to talk\n\n00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.748\nabout some of the exciting\nnew formulas we've discovered\n\n00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:25.445\nfor creating change in government.\n\n00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.700\nEnter the United States Digital Service.\n\n00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:31.757\nThe United States Digital Service\nis a new network of start-ups,\n\n00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:33.336\na team of teams,\n\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.240\norganizing themselves across government\nto create radical change.\n\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.633\nThe mission of the United States\nDigital Service is to help government\n\n00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:43.745\ndeliver world-class digital services\n\n00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:48.298\nfor students, immigrants,\nchildren, the elderly -- everybody --\n\n00:05:48.322 --> 00:05:50.717\nat dramatically lower costs.\n\n00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:55.097\nWe are essentially trying to build\na more awesome government,\n\n00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.222\nfor the people, by the people, today.\n\n00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:59.096\nWe don't care -- (Applause) Thank you.\n\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.312\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:03.827\nWho doesn't want a more\nawesome government, right?\n\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.088\nWe don't care about politics.\n\n00:06:07.112 --> 00:06:09.302\nWe care about making\ngovernment work better,\n\n00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:11.388\nbecause it's the only one we've got.\n\n00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.182\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:17.064\nNow, you can think of our team --\nwell, it's pretty funny --\n\n00:06:17.088 --> 00:06:19.140\nyou can think\nof our team a little bit like\n\n00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:21.774\nthe Peace Corps meets DARPA\nmeets SEAL Team 6.\n\n00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:24.037\nWe're like the Peace Corps for nerds,\n\n00:06:24.061 --> 00:06:27.034\nbut instead of traveling to crazy,\ninteresting, far-off places,\n\n00:06:27.058 --> 00:06:29.447\nyou spend a lot of time indoors,\nbehind computers,\n\n00:06:29.471 --> 00:06:31.716\nhelping restore the fabric\nof our democracy.\n\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.459\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:38.131\nNow, this team -- our playbook\nfor the United States Digital Service\n\n00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:39.495\nis pretty simple.\n\n00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.615\nThe first play is we recruit\nthe very best talent\n\n00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.352\nour country has to offer,\n\n00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:48.381\nand recruit them for short tours\nof duty inside government.\n\n00:06:48.405 --> 00:06:51.907\nThese are the very people who have helped\nbuild the products and companies\n\n00:06:51.931 --> 00:06:55.314\nthat have made our tech sector amongst\nthe most innovative in the world.\n\n00:06:55.338 --> 00:06:58.507\nSecond, we pair these incredible\npeople from the tech core\n\n00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:01.397\nwith the dedicated civil servants\nalready inside government\n\n00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.539\non the ground creating change.\n\n00:07:03.563 --> 00:07:07.449\nThird, we strategically deploy them\nin a targeted formation\n\n00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:10.633\nat the most mission-critical,\nlife-changing, important services\n\n00:07:10.657 --> 00:07:12.164\nthat government offers.\n\n00:07:12.188 --> 00:07:14.831\nAnd finally, we give them\nmassive air cover,\n\n00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:16.730\nfrom the leadership inside the agencies\n\n00:07:16.754 --> 00:07:19.120\nall the way up to the President himself,\n\n00:07:19.144 --> 00:07:21.665\nto transform these services\nfor the better.\n\n00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:25.210\nNow, this team is beginning to disrupt\n\n00:07:25.234 --> 00:07:27.907\nhow government does business\nfrom the inside out.\n\n00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:31.503\nIf you study classic\npatterns of disruption,\n\n00:07:31.527 --> 00:07:34.186\none very common pattern is rather simple.\n\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.813\nIt's to take something that has become\nroutine and standard in one industry\n\n00:07:37.837 --> 00:07:40.377\nand apply it to another\nwhere it's a radical departure\n\n00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:41.670\nfrom the status quo.\n\n00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:45.010\nThink about what Airbnb took\nthat was normal from hospitality\n\n00:07:45.034 --> 00:07:47.222\nand revolutionized my apartment.\n\n00:07:48.016 --> 00:07:50.882\nThe United States Digital Service\nis doing exactly that.\n\n00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:54.200\nWe are taking what Silicon Valley\nand the private sector has learned\n\n00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.526\nthrough a ton of hard work\n\n00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.161\nabout how to build\nplanetary-scale digital services\n\n00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:00.049\nthat delight users at lower cost,\n\n00:08:00.073 --> 00:08:01.913\nand we're applying that to government,\n\n00:08:01.937 --> 00:08:04.833\nwhere it is a radical departure\nfrom the status quo.\n\n00:08:04.857 --> 00:08:06.881\nNow, the good news is:\n\n00:08:07.374 --> 00:08:08.837\nit's starting to work.\n\n00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:12.156\nWe know this because we can\nalready see the results\n\n00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.817\nfrom some of our early projects,\nlike the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,\n\n00:08:15.841 --> 00:08:17.431\nwhen that went off the rails.\n\n00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:21.159\nFixing Healthcare.gov was the first place\nthat we ran this play,\n\n00:08:21.183 --> 00:08:23.040\nand today we are taking that same play\n\n00:08:23.064 --> 00:08:24.810\nand scaling it across a large number\n\n00:08:24.834 --> 00:08:28.242\nof government's most important\ncitizen-facing services.\n\n00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:31.282\nNow, if I can take a moment\n\n00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:33.409\nand brag about the team for a second --\n\n00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:36.020\nit is the highest\nconcentration of badasses\n\n00:08:36.044 --> 00:08:38.248\nI could have ever dreamed of.\n\n00:08:38.272 --> 00:08:42.100\nWe have top talent from Google,\nFacebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,\n\n00:08:42.124 --> 00:08:44.285\nall on staff today,\n\n00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:47.633\nall choosing to join their government.\n\n00:08:47.657 --> 00:08:48.897\nAnd what's incredible is,\n\n00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:52.856\neverybody is as eager and kind\nas they are intelligent.\n\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.340\nAnd I might add, by the way,\nover half of us are women.\n\n00:08:56.364 --> 00:09:00.469\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:03.202 --> 00:09:05.541\nThe best way to understand this strategy\n\n00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:07.825\nis actually to walk through\na couple of examples\n\n00:09:07.849 --> 00:09:09.579\nof how it's working out in the wild.\n\n00:09:09.603 --> 00:09:11.615\nI'm going to give you\ntwo examples quickly.\n\n00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:13.455\nThe first one is about immigration.\n\n00:09:13.944 --> 00:09:17.559\nThis, my friends, is your typical\nimmigration application.\n\n00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:18.746\nYes, you guessed it --\n\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.244\nit's almost entirely paper-based.\n\n00:09:21.268 --> 00:09:22.419\nIn the best case,\n\n00:09:22.443 --> 00:09:25.251\nthe application takes about six\nto eight months to process.\n\n00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:29.108\nIt is physically shipped thousands\nof miles -- thousands of miles! --\n\n00:09:29.132 --> 00:09:31.572\nbetween no less than six\nprocessing centers.\n\n00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:33.516\nNow, little story:\n\n00:09:34.126 --> 00:09:35.277\nabout a decade ago,\n\n00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:38.178\nthe government thought\nthat if it brought this system online,\n\n00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:41.076\nit could save taxpayer dollars\nand provide a better service,\n\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.251\nwhich was a great idea.\n\n00:09:42.275 --> 00:09:45.016\nSo, the typical government process began.\n\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.221\nSix years and 1.2 billion dollars later,\n\n00:09:50.245 --> 00:09:52.526\nno working product was delivered --\n\n00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.636\n1.2 billion with a \"B.\"\n\n00:09:55.438 --> 00:09:57.980\nNow at this point, the agency responsible,\n\n00:09:58.004 --> 00:09:59.927\nUS Citizenship and Immigration Services,\n\n00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:02.715\ncould have kept pouring money\ninto the failing program.\n\n00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:04.382\nSadly, that's what often happens.\n\n00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:06.009\nThat's the status quo today.\n\n00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:07.194\nBut they didn't.\n\n00:10:07.218 --> 00:10:09.436\nThe dedicated civil servants\ninside the agency\n\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.759\ndecided to stand up and call for change.\n\n00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:14.431\nWe deployed a small team\nof just six people,\n\n00:10:14.455 --> 00:10:16.137\nand what many people don't know is\n\n00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:19.092\nthat's the same size as the rescue\neffort of Healthcare.gov --\n\n00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:20.337\njust six people.\n\n00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:22.192\nAnd that team jumped in, side-by-side,\n\n00:10:22.216 --> 00:10:24.930\nto support the agency\nin transitioning this project\n\n00:10:24.954 --> 00:10:28.707\ninto more modern business practices,\nmore modern development practices.\n\n00:10:29.174 --> 00:10:30.339\nNow, in non-tech speak,\n\n00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:34.345\nwhat that basically means\nis taking big, multi-year projects\n\n00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:36.684\nand breaking them up\ninto bite-sized chunks,\n\n00:10:36.708 --> 00:10:38.344\nso that way we can reduce the risk\n\n00:10:38.368 --> 00:10:41.005\nand actually start to see results\nevery couple of weeks,\n\n00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:43.190\ninstead of waiting\nin a black box for years.\n\n00:10:43.214 --> 00:10:46.420\nSo within less than three months\nof our team being on the ground,\n\n00:10:46.444 --> 00:10:49.689\nwe were already able to push\nour first products to production.\n\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.722\nThe first one, this is the form I-90.\n\n00:10:52.746 --> 00:10:56.142\nThis is used to file\nfor your replacement green card.\n\n00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:57.731\nNow, for immigrant visa holders,\n\n00:10:57.755 --> 00:11:00.643\na replacement green card is a big deal.\n\n00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.925\nYour green card is your proof\nof identification,\n\n00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:04.338\nit's your work authorization,\n\n00:11:04.362 --> 00:11:06.811\nit's the proof that you can\nbe here in this country.\n\n00:11:06.835 --> 00:11:10.056\nSo waiting six months while the government\nprocesses the replacement\n\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.280\nis not cool.\n\n00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:12.995\nI'm excited to tell you that today,\n\n00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:16.176\nyou can now, for the first time,\nfile for a replacement green card\n\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.403\nentirely online without anyone\ntouching a piece of paper.\n\n00:11:19.427 --> 00:11:21.445\nIt is faster, it is cheaper,\n\n00:11:21.469 --> 00:11:23.866\nand it's a better user experience\nfor the applicant\n\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.778\nand the government employees alike.\n\n00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:29.319\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:33.786\nAnother one, quickly.\n\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.057\nLast fall, we just released\na brand-new practice civics test.\n\n00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:39.321\nSo as part of becoming a US citizen,\n\n00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:41.695\nyou have to pass a civics test.\n\n00:11:41.719 --> 00:11:46.057\nFor anyone who has taken this test,\nit can be quite the stressful process.\n\n00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:50.668\nSo our team released a very easy,\nsimple-to-use tool in plain language\n\n00:11:50.692 --> 00:11:52.848\nto help people prepare,\n\n00:11:52.872 --> 00:11:54.546\nto help ease their nerves,\n\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.300\nto help them feel more confident\n\n00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:59.755\nin taking the next step\nin pursuing their American dream.\n\n00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:02.690\nBecause all of this work,\nall of this work on immigration,\n\n00:12:02.714 --> 00:12:06.549\nis about taking complicated processes\nand making them more human.\n\n00:12:07.485 --> 00:12:10.515\nThe other day, one of the dedicated\ncivil servants on the ground\n\n00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:13.417\nsaid something incredibly profound.\n\n00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.664\nShe said that she's never been\nthis hopeful or optimistic\n\n00:12:16.688 --> 00:12:19.401\nabout a project in her entire\ntime in government.\n\n00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:22.426\nAnd she's been doing this for 30 years.\n\n00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.664\nThat is exactly the kind of hope\nand culture change\n\n00:12:25.688 --> 00:12:26.956\nwe are trying to create.\n\n00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:30.877\nFor my second example, I want to bring\nit back to veterans for a second,\n\n00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.851\nand what we are doing to build them a VA\n\n00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:35.690\nthat is worthy of their service\nand their sacrifice.\n\n00:12:36.087 --> 00:12:38.255\nI'm proud to say\nthat just a few months ago,\n\n00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.175\nwe released a brand-new beta\n\n00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:42.267\nof a new website, Vets.gov.\n\n00:12:42.878 --> 00:12:44.863\nVets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website\n\n00:12:44.887 --> 00:12:48.623\nthat brings all of the online services\na veteran needs into one place.\n\n00:12:48.647 --> 00:12:51.362\nOne website, not thousands.\n\n00:12:52.124 --> 00:12:55.123\nThe site is a work in progress,\nbut it's significant progress,\n\n00:12:55.147 --> 00:12:57.734\nbecause it's designed\nwith the users who matter most:\n\n00:12:57.758 --> 00:12:59.663\nthe veterans themselves.\n\n00:12:59.687 --> 00:13:02.480\nThis might sound incredibly obvious,\nbecause it should be,\n\n00:13:02.504 --> 00:13:04.726\nbut sadly, this isn't\nnormal for government.\n\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.194\nFar too often, product decisions\nare made by committees of stakeholders\n\n00:13:08.218 --> 00:13:10.900\nwho do their best to represent\nthe interests of the user,\n\n00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:13.228\nbut they're not necessarily\nthe users themselves.\n\n00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:15.793\nSo our team at the VA went out,\nwe looked at the data,\n\n00:13:15.817 --> 00:13:17.481\nwe talked to veterans themselves\n\n00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.093\nand we started simple and small,\n\n00:13:19.117 --> 00:13:22.501\nwith the two most important services\nthat matter most to them:\n\n00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:25.304\neducation benefits\nand disability benefits.\n\n00:13:25.831 --> 00:13:28.475\nI'm proud to say that they are\nlive on the site today,\n\n00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:31.037\nand as the team continues\nto streamline more services,\n\n00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.912\nthey will be ported over here,\nand the old sites, shut down.\n\n00:13:33.936 --> 00:13:38.302\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:43.626\nTo me, this is what change\nlooks like in 2016.\n\n00:13:44.451 --> 00:13:46.225\nWhen you walk out of the Oval Office,\n\n00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:48.590\nthe first time I was ever\nthere, I noticed a quote\n\n00:13:48.614 --> 00:13:50.581\nthe President had embroidered on the rug.\n\n00:13:50.605 --> 00:13:52.510\nIt's the classic JFK quote.\n\n00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:56.901\nIt says, \"No problem of human destiny\nis beyond human beings.\"\n\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.190\nIt's true.\n\n00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:02.357\nWe have the tools to solve these problems.\n\n00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:05.666\nWe have the tools to come together\nas a society, as a country,\n\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.651\nand to fix this together.\n\n00:14:08.031 --> 00:14:09.648\nYes, it's hard.\n\n00:14:09.992 --> 00:14:12.095\nIt's particularly hard\nwhen we have to fight,\n\n00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:16.173\nwhen we have to refuse to succumb\nto the belief that things won't change.\n\n00:14:16.584 --> 00:14:18.314\nBut in my experience,\n\n00:14:18.338 --> 00:14:21.798\nit's often the hardest things\nthat are the most worth doing,\n\n00:14:21.822 --> 00:14:23.627\nbecause if we don't do them,\n\n00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:25.064\nwho will?\n\n00:14:25.088 --> 00:14:27.096\nThis is on us,\n\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.016\nall of us, together,\n\n00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.231\nbecause government is not\nan abstract institution or a concept.\n\n00:14:32.644 --> 00:14:35.223\nOur government is us.\n\n00:14:35.748 --> 00:14:39.997\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:40.499 --> 00:14:42.548\nToday, it is no longer a question\n\n00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:44.476\nof if change is possible.\n\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.317\nThe question is not, \"Can we?\"\n\n00:14:48.325 --> 00:14:49.944\nThe question is, \"Will we?\"\n\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.250\nWill you?\n\n00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:53.442\nThank you.\n\n00:14:53.466 --> 00:14:57.054\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:57.078 --> 00:14:58.268\nThank you.\n\n00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:01.538\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How megacities are changing the map of the world", "duration": "1234", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/parag_khanna_how_megacities_are_changing_the_map_of_the_world", "transcript": "I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth. Think of the planet like a human body that we inhabit. The skeleton is the transportation system of roads and railways, bridges and tunnels, air and seaports that enable our mobility across the continents. The vascular system that powers the body are the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids. that distribute energy. And the nervous system of communications is the Internet cables, satellites, cellular networks and data centers that allow us to share information.This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix already consists of 64 million kilometers of roads, four million kilometers of railways, two million kilometers of pipelines and one million kilometers of Internet cables. What about international borders? We have less than 500,000 kilometers of borders.Let's build a better map of the world. And we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology. There's a saying with which all students of history are familiar: \"Geography is destiny.\" Sounds so grave, doesn't it? It's such a fatalistic adage. It tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor, that small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors, that vast distances are insurmountable. But every journey I take around the world, I see an even greater force sweeping the planet: connectivity.The global connectivity revolution, in all of its forms \u2014 transportation, energy and communications \u2014 has enabled such a quantum leap in the mobility of people, of goods, of resources, of knowledge, such that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it. In fact, I view the two forces as fusing together into what I call \"connectography.\"Connectography represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people, resources and ideas, but it is an evolution, an evolution of the world from political geography, which is how we legally divide the world, to functional geography, which is how we actually use the world, from nations and borders, to infrastructure and supply chains.Our global system is evolving from the vertically integrated empires of the 19th century, through the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century, into a global network civilization in the 21st century. Connectivity, not sovereignty, has become the organizing principle of the human species.(Applause)We are becoming this global network civilization because we are literally building it. All of the world's defense budgets and military spending taken together total just under two trillion dollars per year. Meanwhile, our global infrastructure spending is projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year within the coming decade. And, well, it should. We have been living off an infrastructure stock meant for a world population of three billion, as our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion and eventually nine billion and more. As a rule of thumb, we should spend about one trillion dollars on the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world.Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead. In 2015, China announced the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which together with a network of other organizations aims to construct a network of iron and silk roads, stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.And as all of this topographical engineering unfolds, we will likely spend more on infrastructure in the next 40 years, we will build more infrastructure in the next 40 years, than we have in the past 4,000 years.Now let's stop and think about it for a minute. Spending so much more on building the foundations of global society rather than on the tools to destroy it can have profound consequences. Connectivity is how we optimize the distribution of people and resources around the world. It is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts. I believe that is what is happening.Connectivity has a twin megatrend in the 21st century: planetary urbanization. Cities are the infrastructures that most define us. By 2030, more than two thirds of the world's population will live in cities. And these are not mere little dots on the map, but they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers.Here we are in Vancouver, at the head of the Cascadia Corridor that stretches south across the US border to Seattle. The technology powerhouse of Silicon Valley begins north of San Francisco down to San Jose and across the bay to Oakland. The sprawl of Los Angeles now passes San Diego across the Mexican border to Tijuana. San Diego and Tijuana now share an airport terminal where you can exit into either country. Eventually, a high-speed rail network may connect the entire Pacific spine. America's northeastern megalopolis begins in Boston through New York and Philadelphia to Washington. It contains more than 50 million people and also has plans for a high-speed rail network.But Asia is where we really see the megacities coming together. This continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka contains more than 80 million people and most of Japan's economy. It is the world's largest megacity. For now.But in China, megacity clusters are coming together with populations reaching 100 million people. The Bohai Rim around Beijing, The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta, stretching from Hong Kong north to Guangzhou. And in the middle, the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster, whose geographic footprint is almost the same size as the country of Austria.And any number of these megacity clusters has a GDP approaching two trillion dollars \u2014 that's almost the same as all of India today. So imagine if our global diplomatic institutions, such as the G20, were to base their membership on economic size rather than national representation. Some Chinese megacities may be in and have a seat at the table, while entire countries, like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.Moving to India, whose population will soon exceed that of China, it too has a number of megacity clusters, such as the Delhi Capital Region and Mumbai. In the Middle East, Greater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran's population. Most of Egypt's 80 million people live in the corridor between Cairo and Alexandria. And in the gulf, a necklace of city-states is forming, from Bahrain and Qatar, through the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman.And then there's Lagos, Africa's largest city and Nigeria's commercial hub. It has plans for a rail network that will make it the anchor of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor, stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana, to Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast.But these countries are suburbs of Lagos. In a megacity world, countries can be suburbs of cities. By 2030, we will have as many as 50 such megacity clusters in the world. So which map tells you more? Our traditional map of 200 discrete nations that hang on most of our walls, or this map of the 50 megacity clusters?And yet, even this is incomplete because you cannot understand any individual megacity without understanding its connections to the others. People move to cities to be connected, and connectivity is why these cities thrive. Any number of them, such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow, has a GDP approaching or exceeding one third of one half of their entire national GDP.But equally importantly, you cannot calculate any of their individual value without understanding the role of the flows of people, of finance, of technology that enable them to thrive. Take the Gauteng province of South Africa, which contains Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria. It too represents just over a third of South Africa's GDP. But equally importantly, it is home to the offices of almost every single multinational corporation that invests directly into South Africa and indeed, into the entire African continent.Cities want to be part of global value chains. They want to be part of this global division of labor. That is how cities think. I've never met a mayor who said to me, \"I want my city to be cut off.\" They know that their cities belong as much to the global network civilization as to their home countries.Now, for many people, urbanization causes great dismay. They think cities are wrecking the planet. But right now, there are more than 200 intercity learning networks thriving. That is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations that we have. And all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose, mankind's number one priority in the 21st century: sustainable urbanization.Is it working? Let's take climate change. We know that summit after summit in New York and Paris is not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But what we can see is that transferring technology and knowledge and policies between cities is how we've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies.Cities are learning from each other. How to install zero-emissions buildings, how to deploy electric car-sharing systems. In major Chinese cities, they're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets. In many Western cities, young people don't even want to drive anymore. Cities have been part of the problem, now they are part of the solution.Inequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization. When I travel through megacities from end to end \u2014 it takes hours and days \u2014 I experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography. And yet, our global stock of financial assets has never been larger, approaching 300 trillion dollars. That's almost four times the actual GDP of the world.We have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis, but have we invested them in inclusive growth? No, not yet. Only when we build sufficient, affordable public housing, when we invest in robust transportation networks to allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally, that's when our divided cities and societies will come to feel whole again.(Applause)And that is why infrastructure has just been included in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, because it enables all the others. Our political and economic leaders are learning that connectivity is not charity, it's opportunity. And that's why our financial community needs to understand that connectivity is the most important asset class of the 21st century.Now, cities can make the world more sustainable, they can make the world more equitable, I also believe that connectivity between cities can make the world more peaceful. If we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders, we see more trade, more investment and more stability. We all know the story of Europe after World War II, where industrial integration kicked off a process that gave rise to today's peaceful European Union. And you can see that Russia, by the way, is the least connected of major powers in the international system. And that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today. Countries that have less stake in the system also have less to lose in disturbing it. In North America, the lines that matter most on the map are not the US-Canada border or the US-Mexico border, but the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines and electricity grids and even water canals that are forming an integrated North American union. North America does not need more walls, it needs more connections.(Applause)But the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world. All of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary and where generations of leaders have had hostile relations with each other. But now a new group of leaders has come into power and is burying the hatchet.Let's take Southeast Asia, where high-speed rail networks are planned to connect Bangkok to Singapore and trade corridors from Vietnam to Myanmar. Now this region of 600 million people coordinates its agricultural resources and its industrial output. It is evolving into what I call a Pax Asiana, a peace among Southeast Asian nations.A similar phenomenon is underway in East Africa, where a half dozen countries are investing in railways and multimodal corridors so that landlocked countries can get their goods to market. Now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies. They, too, are evolving into a Pax Africana.One region we know could especially use this kind of thinking is the Middle East. As Arab states tragically collapse, what is left behind but the ancient cities, such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad? In fact, the nearly 400 million people of the Arab world are almost entirely urbanized. As societies, as cities, they are either water rich or water poor, energy rich or energy poor. And the only way to correct these mismatches is not through more wars and more borders, but through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals. Sadly, this is not yet the map of the Middle East. But it should be, a connected Pax Arabia, internally integrated and productively connected to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.Now, it may not seem like connectivity is what we want right now towards the world's most turbulent region. But we know from history that more connectivity is the only way to bring about stability in the long run. Because we know that in region after region, connectivity is the new reality. Cities and countries are learning to aggregate into more peaceful and prosperous wholes.But the real test is going to be Asia. Can connectivity overcome the patterns of rivalry among the great powers of the Far East? After all, this is where World War III is supposed to break out. Since the end of the Cold War, a quarter century ago, at least six major wars have been predicted for this region. But none have broken out.Take China and Taiwan. In the 1990s, this was everyone's leading World War III scenario. But since that time, the trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense that last November, leaders from both sides held a historic summit to discuss eventual peaceful reunification. And even the election of a nationalist party in Taiwan that's pro-independence earlier this year does not undermine this fundamental dynamic.China and Japan have an even longer history of rivalry and have been deploying their air forces and navies to show their strength in island disputes. But in recent years, Japan has been making its largest foreign investments in China. Japanese cars are selling in record numbers there. And guess where the largest number of foreigners residing in Japan today comes from? You guessed it: China.China and India have fought a major war and have three outstanding border disputes, but today India is the second largest shareholder in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. They're building a trade corridor stretching from Northeast India through Myanmar and Bangladesh to Southern China. Their trade volume has grown from 20 billion dollars a decade ago to 80 billion dollars today.Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars and continue to dispute Kashmir, but they're also negotiating a most-favored-nation trade agreement and want to complete a pipeline stretching from Iran through Pakistan to India.And let's talk about Iran. Wasn't it just two years ago that war with Iran seemed inevitable? Then why is every single major power rushing to do business there today?Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot guarantee that World War III will not break out. But we can definitely see why it hasn't happened yet. Even though Asia is home to the world's fastest growing militaries, these same countries are also investing billions of dollars in each other's infrastructure and supply chains. They are more interested in each other's functional geography than in their political geography. And that is why their leaders think twice, step back from the brink, and decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions.So often it seems like the world is falling apart, but building more connectivity is how we put Humpty Dumpty back together again, much better than before. And by wrapping the world in such seamless physical and digital connectivity, we evolve towards a world in which people can rise above their geographic constraints. We are the cells and vessels pulsing through these global connectivity networks.Everyday, hundreds of millions of people go online and work with people they've never met. More than one billion people cross borders every year, and that's expected to rise to three billion in the coming decade.We don't just build connectivity, we embody it. We are the global network civilization, and this is our map. A map of the world in which geography is no longer destiny. Instead, the future has a new and more hopeful motto: connectivity is destiny.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2475, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.838

00:01:44.614\nIt tells us that landlocked countries\nare condemned to be poor,\n\n00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.854\nthat small countries\ncannot escape their larger neighbors,\n\n00:01:47.878 -->

how\nwe optimize the distribution\n\n00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.414\nof people and resources around the world.\n\n00:05:07.438 --> 00:05:11.558\nIt is how mankind comes to be more\nthan just the sum of its parts.\n\n00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:15.398\nI believe that is what is happening.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.894\nConnectivity has a twin megatrend\nin the 21st century:\n\n00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:22.998\nplanetary urbanization.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.238\nCities are the infrastructures\nthat most define us.\n\n00:05:27.798 --> 00:05:31.014\nBy 2030, more than two thirds\nof the world's population\n\n00:05:31.038 --> 00:05:32.294\nwill live in cities.\n\n00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:35.054\nAnd these are not\nmere little dots on the map,\n\n00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:38.678\nbut they are vast archipelagos\nstretching hundreds of kilometers.\n\n00:05:39.318 --> 00:05:40.894\nHere we are in Vancouver,\n\n00:05:40.918 --> 00:05:42.774\nat the head of the Cascadia

00:06:04.094\nwhere you can exit into either country.\n\n00:06:04.118 --> 00:06:08.358\nEventually, a high-speed rail network\nmay connect the entire Pacific spine.\n\n00:06:09.638 -->

than 50 million people\n\n00:06:17.798 --> 00:06:20.574\nand also has plans\nfor a high-speed rail network.\n\n00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:24.518\nBut Asia is where we really see\nthe megacities coming

--> 00:06:33.398\nand most of Japan's economy.\n\n00:06:34.158 --> 00:06:36.478\nIt is the world's largest megacity.\n\n00:06:37.118 --> 00:06:38.318\nFor now.\n\n00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:41.294\nBut in

representation.\n\n00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:26.854\nSome Chinese megacities\nmay be in and have a seat at the table,\n\n00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:30.998\nwhile entire countries,\nlike Argentina or Indonesia would be out.\n\n00:07:32.038 --> 00:07:35.734\nMoving to India, whose population\nwill soon exceed that of China,\n\n00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:38.054\nit too has a number of megacity clusters,\n\n00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:40.494\nsuch as the Delhi Capital Region\n\n00:07:40.518 --> 00:07:41.974\nand Mumbai.\n\n00:07:41.998 --> 00:07:43.214\nIn the Middle East,\n\n00:07:43.238 -->

largest city\nand Nigeria's commercial hub.\n\n00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:08.694\nIt has plans for a rail network\n\n00:08:08.718 --> 00:08:13.134\nthat will make it the anchor\nof a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,\n\n00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:16.214\nstretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,\n\n00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:19.694\nto Abidjan, the capital\nof the Ivory Coast.\n\n00:08:19.718 --> 00:08:23.278\nBut these countries are suburbs of Lagos.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.814\nIn a megacity world,\n\n00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.598\ncountries can be suburbs of cities.\n\n00:08:30.598 --> 00:08:36.718\nBy 2030, we will have as many\nas 50 such megacity clusters in the world.\n\n00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:39.214\nSo which map tells you more?\n\n00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:42.374\nOur traditional map\nof 200 discrete nations\n\n00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:44.294\nthat hang on most of our walls,\n\n00:08:44.318 --> 00:08:47.318\nor this map of the 50 megacity clusters?\n\n00:08:48.117 --> 00:08:50.853\nAnd yet, even this is incomplete\n\n00:08:50.877 --> 00:08:54.894\nbecause you cannot understand\nany individual megacity\n\n00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:58.078\nwithout understanding\nits connections to the others.\n\n00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:01.214\nPeople move to cities to be connected,\n\n00:09:01.238 --> 00:09:04.438\nand connectivity\nis why these cities thrive.\n\n00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:08.934\nAny number of them,\nsuch as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:13.054\nhas a GDP approaching or exceeding\none third of one half\n\n00:09:13.078 --> 00:09:15.238\nof their entire national GDP.\n\n00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:17.854\nBut equally importantly,\n\n00:09:17.878 --> 00:09:20.734\nyou cannot calculate\nany of their individual value\n\n00:09:20.758 --> 00:09:24.414\nwithout understanding\nthe role of the flows of people,\n\n00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:26.134\nof finance, of technology\n\n00:09:26.158 --> 00:09:27.838\nthat enable them to thrive.\n\n00:09:28.598 --> 00:09:31.334\nTake the Gauteng province of South Africa,\n\n00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:34.494\nwhich contains Johannesburg\nand the capital Pretoria.\n\n00:09:34.518 --> 00:09:38.454\nIt too represents just over\na third of South Africa's GDP.\n\n00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:41.734\nBut equally importantly,\nit is home to the offices\n\n00:09:41.758 --> 00:09:44.734\nof almost every single\nmultinational corporation\n\n00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:46.974\nthat invests directly into South Africa\n\n00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:49.478\nand indeed, into the entire\nAfrican continent.\n\n00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:54.334\nCities want to be part\nof global value chains.\n\n00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:57.934\nThey want to be part\nof this global division of labor.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.798\nThat is how cities think.\n\n00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:02.414\nI've never met a mayor who said to me,\n\n00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:03.998\n\"I want my city to be cut off.\"\n\n00:10:04.798 --> 00:10:07.854\nThey know that their cities belong as much\n\n00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:13.198\nto the global network civilization\nas to their home countries.\n\n00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:18.278\nNow, for many people,\nurbanization causes great dismay.\n\n00:10:18.878 --> 00:10:21.078\nThey think cities are wrecking the planet.\n\n00:10:21.918 --> 00:10:23.134\nBut right now,\n\n00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:27.414\nthere are more than 200\nintercity learning networks thriving.\n\n00:10:27.438 --> 00:10:30.774\nThat is as many as the number\nof intergovernmental organizations\n\n00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.014\nthat we have.\n\n00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:36.414\nAnd all of these intercity networks\nare devoted to one purpose,\n\n00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:41.134\nmankind's number one priority\nin the 21st century:\n\n00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:43.238\nsustainable urbanization.\n\n00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:45.838\nIs it working?\n\n00:10:46.518 --> 00:10:48.254\nLet's take climate change.\n\n00:10:48.278 --> 00:10:51.014\nWe know that summit after summit\nin New York and Paris\n\n00:10:51.038 --> 00:10:53.838\nis not going to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n\n00:10:54.518 --> 00:10:57.814\nBut what we can see\nis that transferring technology\n\n00:10:57.838 --> 00:11:00.454\nand knowledge and policies between cities\n\n00:11:00.478 --> 00:11:05.094\nis how we've actually begun to reduce\nthe carbon intensity of our economies.\n\n00:11:05.118 --> 00:11:07.254\nCities are learning from each other.\n\n00:11:07.278 --> 00:11:09.734\nHow to install zero-emissions buildings,\n\n00:11:09.758 --> 00:11:12.894\nhow to deploy electric\ncar-sharing systems.\n\n00:11:12.918 --> 00:11:14.134\nIn major Chinese cities,\n\n00:11:14.158 --> 00:11:17.214\nthey're imposing quotas\non the number of cars on the streets.\n\n00:11:17.238 --> 00:11:18.494\nIn many Western cities,\n\n00:11:18.518 --> 00:11:20.838\nyoung people don't even\nwant to drive anymore.\n\n00:11:21.678 --> 00:11:23.894\nCities have been part of the problem,\n\n00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:25.918\nnow they are part of the solution.\n\n00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:31.438\nInequality is the other great challenge\nto achieving sustainable urbanization.\n\n00:11:31.918 --> 00:11:35.334\nWhen I travel through megacities\nfrom end to end --\n\n00:11:35.358 --> 00:11:37.454\nit takes hours and days --\n\n00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:41.214\nI experience the tragedy\nof extreme disparity\n\n00:11:41.238 --> 00:11:43.158\nwithin the same geography.\n\n00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:47.054\nAnd yet, our global stock\nof financial assets\n\n00:11:47.078 --> 00:11:48.534\nhas never been larger,\n\n00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:52.054\napproaching 300 trillion dollars.\n\n00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:55.478\nThat's almost four times\nthe actual GDP of the world.\n\n00:11:56.478 --> 00:12:00.934\nWe have taken on such enormous debts\nsince the financial crisis,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.118\nbut have we invested them\nin inclusive growth?\n\n00:12:04.798 --> 00:12:06.918\nNo, not yet.\n\n00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:11.574\nOnly when we build sufficient,\naffordable public housing,\n\n00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:14.734\nwhen we invest in robust\ntransportation networks\n\n00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:19.294\nto allow people to connect to each other\nboth physically and digitally,\n\n00:12:19.318 --> 00:12:21.694\nthat's when our divided\ncities and societies\n\n00:12:21.718 --> 00:12:23.574\nwill come to feel whole again.\n\n00:12:23.598 --> 00:12:26.438\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:27.798 --> 00:12:30.694\nAnd that is why infrastructure\nhas just been included\n\n00:12:30.718 --> 00:12:33.174\nin the United Nations\nSustainable Development Goals,\n\n00:12:33.198 --> 00:12:35.518\nbecause it enables all the others.\n\n00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:37.854\nOur political and economic leaders\n\n00:12:37.878 --> 00:12:40.974\nare learning that connectivity\nis not charity,\n\n00:12:40.998 --> 00:12:42.198\nit's opportunity.\n\n00:12:43.038 --> 00:12:45.774\nAnd that's why our financial community\nneeds to understand\n\n00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:50.798\nthat connectivity is the most\nimportant asset class of the 21st century.\n\n00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:55.918\nNow, cities can make the world\nmore sustainable,\n\n00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:58.814\nthey can make the world more equitable,\n\n00:12:58.838 --> 00:13:01.694\nI also believe that\nconnectivity between cities\n\n00:13:01.718 --> 00:13:03.478\ncan make the world more peaceful.\n\n00:13:04.358 --> 00:13:08.374\nIf we look at regions of the world\nwith dense relations across borders,\n\n00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:11.174\nwe see more trade, more investment\n\n00:13:11.198 --> 00:13:12.614\nand more stability.\n\n00:13:12.638 --> 00:13:15.134\nWe all know the story\nof Europe after World War II,\n\n00:13:15.158 --> 00:13:17.734\nwhere industrial integration\nkicked off a process\n\n00:13:17.758 --> 00:13:20.318\nthat gave rise to today's\npeaceful European Union.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.574\nAnd you can see that Russia, by the way,\n\n00:13:23.598 --> 00:13:27.598\nis the least connected of major powers\nin the international system.\n\n00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:31.974\nAnd that goes a long way\ntowards explaining the tensions today.\n\n00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:34.894\nCountries that have\nless stake in the system\n\n00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:37.278\nalso have less to lose in disturbing it.\n\n00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:41.574\nIn North America, the lines\nthat matter most on the map\n\n00:13:41.598 --> 00:13:45.374\nare not the US-Canada border\nor the US-Mexico border,\n\n00:13:45.398 --> 00:13:48.774\nbut the dense network of roads\nand railways and pipelines\n\n00:13:48.798 --> 00:13:51.654\nand electricity grids\nand even water canals\n\n00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:55.494\nthat are forming an integrated\nNorth American union.\n\n00:13:55.518 --> 00:14:00.214\nNorth America does not need more walls,\nit needs more connections.\n\n00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:02.878\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:07.838 --> 00:14:12.174\nBut the real promise of connectivity\nis in the postcolonial world.\n\n00:14:12.198 --> 00:14:16.534\nAll of those regions where borders\nhave historically been the most arbitrary\n\n00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:18.494\nand where generations of leaders\n\n00:14:18.518 --> 00:14:21.134\nhave had hostile relations\nwith each other.\n\n00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:23.534\nBut now a new group of leaders\nhas come into power\n\n00:14:23.558 --> 00:14:25.118\nand is burying the hatchet.\n\n00:14:25.718 --> 00:14:28.894\nLet's take Southeast Asia,\nwhere high-speed rail networks\n\n00:14:28.918 --> 00:14:31.214\nare planned to connect\nBangkok to Singapore\n\n00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:34.134\nand trade corridors\nfrom Vietnam to Myanmar.\n\n00:14:34.158 --> 00:14:39.694\nNow this region of 600 million people\ncoordinates its agricultural resources\n\n00:14:39.718 --> 00:14:41.118\nand its industrial output.\n\n00:14:41.678 --> 00:14:46.334\nIt is evolving\ninto what I call a Pax Asiana,\n\n00:14:46.358 --> 00:14:49.198\na peace among Southeast Asian nations.\n\n00:14:49.998 --> 00:14:53.134\nA similar phenomenon\nis underway in East Africa,\n\n00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.534\nwhere a half dozen countries\n\n00:14:54.558 --> 00:14:57.854\nare investing in railways\nand multimodal corridors\n\n00:14:57.878 --> 00:15:01.014\nso that landlocked countries\ncan get their goods to market.\n\n00:15:01.038 --> 00:15:03.614\nNow these countries\ncoordinate their utilities\n\n00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:05.734\nand their investment policies.\n\n00:15:05.758 --> 00:15:09.558\nThey, too, are evolving\ninto a Pax Africana.\n\n00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:14.054\nOne region we know could\nespecially use this kind of thinking\n\n00:15:14.078 --> 00:15:15.358\nis the Middle East.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.414\nAs Arab states tragically collapse,\n\n00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:21.174\nwhat is left behind\nbut the ancient cities,\n\n00:15:21.198 --> 00:15:23.678\nsuch as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?\n\n00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:29.094\nIn fact, the nearly\n400 million people of the Arab world\n\n00:15:29.118 --> 00:15:31.214\nare almost entirely urbanized.\n\n00:15:31.238 --> 00:15:33.134\nAs societies, as cities,\n\n00:15:33.158 --> 00:15:35.414\nthey are either water rich or water poor,\n\n00:15:35.438 --> 00:15:37.198\nenergy rich or energy poor.\n\n00:15:37.998 --> 00:15:40.894\nAnd the only way\nto correct these mismatches\n\n00:15:40.918 --> 00:15:43.534\nis not through more wars and more borders,\n\n00:15:43.558 --> 00:15:47.398\nbut through more connectivity\nof pipelines and water canals.\n\n00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:51.934\nSadly, this is not yet\nthe map of the Middle East.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.158\nBut it should be,\n\n00:15:54.718 --> 00:15:57.758\na connected Pax Arabia,\n\n00:15:58.598 --> 00:16:00.294\ninternally integrated\n\n00:16:00.318 --> 00:16:04.614\nand productively connected\nto its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\n00:16:04.638 --> 00:16:07.734\nNow, it may not seem like connectivity\nis what we want right now\n\n00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.798\ntowards the world's most turbulent region.\n\n00:16:10.558 --> 00:16:14.174\nBut we know from history\nthat more connectivity is the only way\n\n00:16:14.198 --> 00:16:16.694\nto bring about stability in the long run.\n\n00:16:16.718 --> 00:16:19.414\nBecause we know\nthat in region after region,\n\n00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:22.374\nconnectivity is the new reality.\n\n00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:25.534\nCities and countries\nare learning to aggregate\n\n00:16:25.558 --> 00:16:28.038\ninto more peaceful and prosperous wholes.\n\n00:16:29.718 --> 00:16:32.038\nBut the real test is going to be Asia.\n\n00:16:32.998 --> 00:16:35.934\nCan connectivity overcome\nthe patterns of rivalry\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.534\namong the great powers of the Far East?\n\n00:16:38.558 --> 00:16:42.918\nAfter all, this is where World War III\nis supposed to break out.\n\n00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:47.014\nSince the end of the Cold War,\na quarter century ago,\n\n00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:50.414\nat least six major wars\nhave been predicted for this region.\n\n00:16:50.438 --> 00:16:52.038\nBut none have broken out.\n\n00:16:53.118 --> 00:16:54.678\nTake China and Taiwan.\n\n00:16:55.518 --> 00:17:00.134\nIn the 1990s, this was everyone's\nleading World War III scenario.\n\n00:17:00.158 --> 00:17:01.654\nBut since that time,\n\n00:17:01.678 --> 00:17:06.174\nthe trade and investment volumes\nacross the straits have become so intense\n\n00:17:06.198 --> 00:17:07.414\nthat last November,\n\n00:17:07.438 --> 00:17:10.294\nleaders from both sides\nheld a historic summit\n\n00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:13.158\nto discuss eventual\npeaceful reunification.\n\n00:17:13.918 --> 00:17:16.734\nAnd even the election\nof a nationalist party in Taiwan\n\n00:17:16.758 --> 00:17:19.534\nthat's pro-independence earlier this year\n\n00:17:19.557 --> 00:17:22.037\ndoes not undermine\nthis fundamental dynamic.\n\n00:17:23.317 --> 00:17:26.214\nChina and Japan have\nan even longer history of rivalry\n\n00:17:26.238 --> 00:17:28.653\nand have been deploying\ntheir air forces and navies\n\n00:17:28.678 --> 00:17:30.838\nto show their strength in island disputes.\n\n00:17:31.478 --> 00:17:32.694\nBut in recent years,\n\n00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:36.854\nJapan has been making\nits largest foreign investments in China.\n\n00:17:36.878 --> 00:17:39.598\nJapanese cars are selling\nin record numbers there.\n\n00:17:40.398 --> 00:17:43.334\nAnd guess where\nthe largest number of foreigners\n\n00:17:43.358 --> 00:17:45.478\nresiding in Japan today comes from?\n\n00:17:46.078 --> 00:17:47.878\nYou guessed it: China.\n\n00:17:49.478 --> 00:17:51.374\nChina and India have fought a major war\n\n00:17:51.398 --> 00:17:53.454\nand have three outstanding\nborder disputes,\n\n00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:55.934\nbut today India is the second\nlargest shareholder\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.374\nin the Asian

brings Pixar movies to life", "duration": "724", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/danielle_feinberg_the_magic_ingredient_that_brings_pixar_movies_to_life", "transcript": "When I was seven years old, some well-meaning adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. Proudly, I said: \"An artist.\" \"No, you don't,\" he said, \"You can't make a living being an artist!\"My little seven-year-old Picasso dreams were crushed. But I gathered myself, went off in search of a new dream, eventually settling on being a scientist, perhaps something like the next Albert Einstein.(Laughter)I have always loved math and science, later, coding. And so I decided to study computer programming in college. In my junior year, my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films. It was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen. I watched these films in wonder, transfixed, fireworks going off in my head, thinking, \"That is what I want to do with my life.\" The idea that all the math, science and code I had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories I connected with, was pure magic for me.Just two years later, I started working at the place that made those films, Pixar Animation Studios. It was here I learned how we actually execute those films. To create our movies, we create a three-dimensional world inside the computer. We start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that creates characters, or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest. And because it's a three-dimensional world, we can move a camera around inside that world. I was fascinated by all of it. But then I got my first taste of lighting.Lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world. I actually have icons of lights I move around in there. Here you can see I've added a light, I'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software, turn on shadows and placing the light. As I place a light, I think about what it might look like in real life, but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story. So it might look like this at first, but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work, in rough form it might look like this, and in final form, like this.There's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it. It's where we go from this to this. It's the moment where all the pieces come together, and suddenly the world comes to life as if it's an actual place that exists. This moment never gets old, especially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist.As I learned to light, I learned about using light to help tell story, to set the time of day, to create the mood, to guide the audience's eye, how to make a character look appealing or stand out in a busy set.Did you see WALL-E?(Laughter)There he is.As you can see, we can create any world that we want inside the computer. We can make a world with monsters, with robots that fall in love, we can even make pigs fly.(Laughter)While this is an incredible thing, this untethered artistic freedom, it can create chaos. It can create unbelievable worlds, unbelievable movement, things that are jarring to the audience.So to combat this, we tether ourselves with science. We use science and the world we know as a backbone, to ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable. \"Finding Nemo\" is an excellent example of this. A major portion of the movie takes place underwater. But how do you make it look underwater?In early research and development, we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer. Then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look. One of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water. So we coded up a light that mimics this physics \u2014 first, the visibility of the water, and then what happens with the color. Objects close to the eye have their full, rich colors. As light travels deeper into the water, we lose the red wavelengths, then the green wavelengths, leaving us with blue at the far depths.In this clip you can see two other important elements. The first is the surge and swell, or the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water. The second is the caustics. These are the ribbons of light, like you might see on the bottom of a pool, that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean's surface. Here we have the fog beams. These give us color depth cues, but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don't see the water surface. The other really cool thing you can see here is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics, so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light, it appears and disappears, lending a subtle, magical sparkle to the underwater.You can see how we're using the science \u2014 the physics of water, light and movement \u2014 to tether that artistic freedom. But we are not beholden to it. We considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood.We realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with. So here's a traditionally colored underwater scene. But here, we can take Sydney Harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what's happening. In this scene, it's really important we see deep into the underwater, so we understand what the East Australian Current is, that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride. So we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you would ever see in real life. Because in the end, we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world, we're trying to create a believable world, one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story.We use science to create something wonderful. We use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder. This guy, WALL-E, is a great example of that. He finds beauty in the simplest things. But when he came in to lighting, we knew we had a big problem. We got so geeked-out on making WALL-E this convincing robot, that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect.(Laughter)His binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has. He doesn't have a face or even traditional dialogue, for that matter. So the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions.We started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections. He was starting to look glassy-eyed.(Laughter)Now, glassy-eyed is a fundamentally awful thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he's capable of falling in love. So we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars, trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem.So we started with the lenses. Here's the flat-front lens, we have a concave lens and a convex lens. And here you see all three together, showing us all these reflections. We tried turning them down, we tried blocking them, nothing was working. You can see here, sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes \u2014 usually Eve. So we couldn't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses. So here we have Eve on the first lens, we put Eve on the second lens, it's not working. We turn it down, it's still not working.And then we have our eureka moment. We add a light to WALL-E that accidentally leaks into his eyes. You can see it light up these gray aperture blades. Suddenly, those aperture blades are poking through that reflection the way nothing else has. Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye. As humans we have the white of our eye, the colored iris and the black pupil. Now WALL-E has the black of an eye, the gray aperture blades and the black pupil. Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul, like there's a character with emotion inside. Later in the movie towards the end, WALL-E loses his personality, essentially going dead. This is the perfect time to bring back that glassy-eyed look. In the next scene, WALL-E comes back to life. We bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back, and he returns to that sweet, soulful robot we've come to love.(Video) WALL-E: Eva?Danielle Feinberg: There's a beauty in these unexpected moments \u2014 when you find the key to unlocking a robot's soul, the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life. The jellyfish in \"Finding Nemo\" was one of those moments for me.There are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together. This was one of those scenes. The director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific. As we went along, we were floundering. The reviews with the director turned from the normal look-and-feel conversation into more and more questions about numbers and percentages. Maybe because unlike normal, we were basing it on something in real life, or maybe just because we had lost our way. But it had become about using our brain without our eyes, the science without the art. That scientific tether was strangling the scene.But even through all the frustrations, I still believed it could be beautiful. So when it came in to lighting, I dug in. As I worked to balance the blues and the pinks, the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells, the undulating fog beams, something promising began to appear. I came in one morning and checked the previous night's work. And I got excited. And then I showed it to the lighting director and she got excited. Soon, I was showing to the director in a dark room full of 50 people.In director review, you hope you might get some nice words, then you get some notes and fixes, generally. And then, hopefully, you get a final, signaling to move on to the next stage. I gave my intro, and I played the jellyfish scene. And the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time. Just long enough for me to think, \"Oh no, this is doomed.\" And then he started clapping. And then the production designer started clapping. And then the whole room was clapping. This is the moment that I live for in lighting. The moment where it all comes together and we get a world that we can believe in.We use math, science and code to create these amazing worlds. We use storytelling and art to bring them to life. It's this interweaving of art and science that elevates the world to a place of wonder, a place with soul, a place we can believe in, a place where the things you imagine can become real \u2014 and a world where a girl suddenly realizes not only is she a scientist, but also an artist.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2466, "subtitle":

computer.\n\n00:04:06.837 --> 00:04:08.098\nThen we broke it back down\n\n00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.896\nto see which elements make up\nthat underwater look.\n\n00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.091\nOne of the most critical elements\n\n00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:15.297\nwas how the light travels\nthrough the water.\n\n00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.117\nSo we coded up a light\nthat mimics this physics --\n\n00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:19.885\nfirst, the visibility of the water,\n\n00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.018\nand then what happens with the color.\n\n00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:26.003\nObjects close to the eye\nhave their full, rich colors.\n\n00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:28.230\nAs light travels deeper into the water,\n\n00:04:28.254 --> 00:04:30.164\nwe lose the red wavelengths,\n\n00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:31.532\nthen the green wavelengths,\n\n00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:33.906\nleaving us with blue at the far depths.\n\n00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:37.724\nIn this clip you can see\ntwo other important elements.\n\n00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:39.770\nThe first is the surge and swell,\n\n00:04:39.794 --> 00:04:41.511\nor the invisible underwater current\n\n00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:44.720\nthat pushes the bits of particulate\naround in the water.\n\n00:04:44.744 --> 00:04:46.761\nThe second is the caustics.\n\n00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:48.295\nThese are the ribbons of light,\n\n00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.343\nlike you might see\non the bottom of a pool,\n\n00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:52.917\nthat are created when the sun\nbends through the crests\n\n00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:55.615\nof the ripples and waves\non the ocean's surface.\n\n00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.294\nHere we have the fog beams.\n\n00:04:58.318 --> 00:04:59.973\nThese give us color depth cues,\n\n00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:02.092\nbut also tells which direction is up\n\n00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:04.392\nin shots where we don't\nsee the water surface.\n\n00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:06.865\nThe other really cool thing\nyou can see here\n\n00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.049\nis that we lit that particulate\nonly with the caustics,\n\n00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:12.731\nso that as it goes in and out\nof those ribbons of light,\n\n00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.268\nit appears and disappears,\n\n00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:17.361\nlending a subtle, magical\nsparkle to the underwater.\n\n00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:21.030\nYou can see how we're using the science --\n\n00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.930\nthe physics of water,\nlight and movement --\n\n00:05:23.954 --> 00:05:26.000\nto tether that artistic freedom.\n\n00:05:26.528 --> 00:05:28.849\nBut we are not beholden to it.\n\n00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:30.672\nWe considered each of these elements\n\n00:05:30.696 --> 00:05:33.710\nand which ones had to be\nscientifically accurate\n\n00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:37.816\nand which ones we could push and pull\nto suit the story and the mood.\n\n00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.649\nWe realized early on that color\nwas one we had some leeway with.\n\n00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:44.285\nSo here's a traditionally colored\nunderwater scene.\n\n00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.150\nBut here, we can take Sydney Harbor\nand push it fairly green\n\n00:05:47.174 --> 00:05:49.434\nto suit the sad mood of what's happening.\n\n00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:53.532\nIn this scene, it's really important\nwe see deep into the underwater,\n\n00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:56.223\nso we understand what\nthe East Australian Current is,\n\n00:05:56.247 --> 00:05:59.635\nthat the turtles are diving into\nand going on this roller coaster ride.\n\n00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.596\nSo we pushed the visibility of the water\n\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.323\nwell past anything you would\never see in real life.\n\n00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:05.963\nBecause in the end,\n\n00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:10.611\nwe are not trying to recreate\nthe scientifically correct real world,\n\n00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:12.675\nwe're trying to create a believable world,\n\n00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.646\none the audience can immerse\nthemselves in to experience the story.\n\n00:06:17.302 --> 00:06:20.025\nWe use science to create\nsomething wonderful.\n\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.776\nWe use story and artistic touch\nto get us to a place of wonder.\n\n00:06:25.536 --> 00:06:28.012\nThis guy, WALL-E, is a great\nexample of that.\n\n00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:30.466\nHe finds beauty in the simplest things.\n\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.579\nBut when he came in to lighting,\nwe knew we had a big problem.\n\n00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:37.381\nWe got so geeked-out on making\nWALL-E this convincing robot,\n\n00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:40.785\nthat we made his binoculars\npractically optically perfect.\n\n00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:42.339\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:47.280\nHis binoculars are one of the most\ncritical acting devices he has.\n\n00:06:47.304 --> 00:06:50.846\nHe doesn't have a face or even\ntraditional dialogue, for that matter.\n\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.797\nSo the animators were heavily\ndependent on the binoculars\n\n00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:56.074\nto sell his acting and emotions.\n\n00:06:56.468 --> 00:06:58.177\nWe started lighting and we realized\n\n00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:02.415\nthe triple lenses inside his binoculars\nwere a mess of reflections.\n\n00:07:02.947 --> 00:07:05.000\nHe was starting to look glassy-eyed.\n\n00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.748\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:06.772 --> 00:07:10.186\nNow, glassy-eyed\nis a fundamentally awful thing\n\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.226\nwhen you are trying\nto convince an audience\n\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.733\nthat a robot has a personality\nand he's capable of falling in love.\n\n00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:19.980\nSo we went to work on these optically\nperfect binoculars,\n\n00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:23.706\ntrying to find a solution that would\nmaintain his true robot materials\n\n00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.721\nbut solve this reflection problem.\n\n00:07:26.054 --> 00:07:27.512\nSo we started with the lenses.\n\n00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:28.928\nHere's the flat-front lens,\n\n00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:30.458\nwe have a concave lens\n\n00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:31.739\nand a convex lens.\n\n00:07:31.763 --> 00:07:33.868\nAnd here you see all three together,\n\n00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:35.777\nshowing us all these reflections.\n\n00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.796\nWe tried turning them down,\n\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.516\nwe tried blocking them,\n\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.980\nnothing was working.\n\n00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:42.895\nYou can see here,\n\n00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:46.043\nsometimes we needed something specific\nreflected in his eyes --\n\n00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:47.218\nusually Eve.\n\n00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:50.773\nSo we couldn't just use some faked\nabstract image on the lenses.\n\n00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:52.947\nSo here we have Eve on the first lens,\n\n00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.022\nwe put Eve on the second lens,\n\n00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:56.291\nit's not working.\n\n00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:57.475\nWe turn it down,\n\n00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:59.175\nit's still not working.\n\n00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.529\nAnd then we have our eureka moment.\n\n00:08:01.553 --> 00:08:05.369\nWe add a light to WALL-E\nthat accidentally leaks into his eyes.\n\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.440\nYou can see it light up\nthese gray aperture blades.\n\n00:08:10.195 --> 00:08:13.518\nSuddenly, those aperture blades\nare poking through that reflection\n\n00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:15.327\nthe way nothing else has.\n\n00:08:15.924 --> 00:08:19.466\nNow we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.\n\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.139\nAs humans we have the white of our eye,\n\n00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:23.314\nthe colored iris\n\n00:08:23.338 --> 00:08:24.559\nand the black pupil.\n\n00:08:24.906 --> 00:08:28.247\nNow WALL-E has the black of an eye,\n\n00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:29.798\nthe gray aperture blades\n\n00:08:29.822 --> 00:08:31.241\nand the black pupil.\n\n00:08:31.647 --> 00:08:35.289\nSuddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,\n\n00:08:35.313 --> 00:08:38.191\nlike there's a character\nwith emotion inside.\n\n00:08:39.996 --> 00:08:41.813\nLater in the movie towards the end,\n\n00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:43.315\nWALL-E loses his personality,\n\n00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:44.917\nessentially going dead.\n\n00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:48.868\nThis is the perfect time to bring back\nthat glassy-eyed look.\n\n00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:51.991\nIn the next scene,\nWALL-E comes back to life.\n\n00:08:52.015 --> 00:08:55.198\nWe bring that light back to bring\nthe aperture blades back,\n\n00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:58.682\nand he returns to that sweet,\nsoulful robot we've come to love.\n\n00:09:02.402 --> 00:09:03.766\n(Video) WALL-E: Eva?\n\n00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:09.919\nDanielle Feinberg: There's a beauty\nin these unexpected moments --\n\n00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:13.509\nwhen you find the key\nto unlocking a robot's soul,\n\n00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:16.696\nthe moment when you discover\nwhat you want to do with your life.\n\n00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:20.395\nThe jellyfish in \"Finding Nemo\"\nwas one of those moments for me.\n\n00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:24.010\nThere are scenes in every movie\nthat struggle to come together.\n\n00:09:24.034 --> 00:09:25.969\nThis was one of those scenes.\n\n00:09:25.993 --> 00:09:28.127\nThe director had a vision for this scene\n\n00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:31.959\nbased on some wonderful footage\nof jellyfish in the South Pacific.\n\n00:09:33.097 --> 00:09:34.954\nAs we went along,\n\n00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:36.431\nwe were floundering.\n\n00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:38.544\nThe reviews with the director\n\n00:09:38.568 --> 00:09:41.257\nturned from the normal\nlook-and-feel conversation\n\n00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:45.408\ninto more and more questions\nabout numbers and percentages.\n\n00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:47.734\nMaybe because unlike normal,\n\n00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:50.011\nwe were basing it on\nsomething in real life,\n\n00:09:50.035 --> 00:09:52.620\nor maybe just because we had lost our way.\n\n00:09:52.644 --> 00:09:55.755\nBut it had become about using\nour brain without our eyes,\n\n00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:57.634\nthe science without the art.\n\n00:09:58.209 --> 00:10:01.388\nThat scientific tether\nwas strangling the scene.\n\n00:10:02.492 --> 00:10:04.338\nBut even through all the frustrations,\n\n00:10:04.362 --> 00:10:06.397\nI still believed it could be beautiful.\n\n00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:08.080\nSo when it came in to lighting,\n\n00:10:08.104 --> 00:10:09.335\nI dug in.\n\n00:10:10.107 --> 00:10:13.398\nAs I worked to balance\nthe blues and the pinks,\n\n00:10:13.422 --> 00:10:16.238\nthe caustics dancing\non the jellyfish bells,\n\n00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:18.436\nthe undulating fog beams,\n\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.882\nsomething promising began to appear.\n\n00:10:21.644 --> 00:10:24.871\nI came in one morning and checked\nthe previous night's work.\n\n00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:26.371\nAnd I got excited.\n\n00:10:26.395 --> 00:10:28.503\nAnd then I showed it\nto the lighting director\n\n00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.702\nand she got excited.\n\n00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:34.142\nSoon, I was showing to the director\nin a dark room full of 50 people.\n\n00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:35.784\nIn director review,\n\n00:10:35.808 --> 00:10:37.866\nyou hope you might get some nice words,\n\n00:10:38.307 --> 00:10:40.603\nthen you get some notes\nand fixes, generally.\n\n00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:43.803\nAnd then, hopefully, you get a final,\n\n00:10:43.827 --> 00:10:45.875\nsignaling to move on to the next stage.\n\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.788\nI gave my intro, and I played\nthe jellyfish scene.\n\n00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:54.513\nAnd the director was silent\nfor an uncomfortably long amount of time.\n\n00:10:55.198 --> 00:10:57.705\nJust long enough for me to think,\n\n00:10:57.729 --> 00:10:59.585\n\"Oh no, this is doomed.\"\n\n00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:02.637\nAnd then he started clapping.\n\n00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:05.731\nAnd then the production\ndesigner started clapping.\n\n00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:08.342\nAnd then the whole room was clapping.\n\n00:11:14.243 --> 00:11:17.329\nThis is the moment\nthat I live for in lighting.\n\n00:11:17.353 --> 00:11:19.516\nThe moment where it all comes together\n\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.187\nand we get a world that we can believe in.\n\n00:11:22.676 --> 00:11:26.564\nWe use math, science and code\nto create these amazing worlds.\n\n00:11:26.988 --> 00:11:29.834\nWe use storytelling and art\nto bring them to life.\n\n00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:34.409\nIt's this interweaving of art and science\n\n00:11:34.433 --> 00:11:38.096\nthat elevates the world\nto a place of wonder,\n\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.753\na place with soul,\n\n00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:41.547\na place we can believe in,\n\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.561\na place where the things\nyou imagine can become real --\n\n00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:50.241\nand a world where a girl suddenly realizes\n\n00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:52.425\nnot only is she a scientist,\n\n00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:53.764\nbut also an artist.\n\n00:11:54.502 --> 00:11:55.653\nThank you.\n\n00:11:55.677 --> 00:11:58.957\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The most mysterious star in the universe", "duration": "826", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe", "transcript": "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.Now, I want to tell you a story about that. It involves data from a NASA mission, ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy.It began in 2009 with the launch of NASA's Kepler mission. Kepler's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system. It did this by staring at a single field in the sky, this one, with all the tiny boxes. And in this one field, it monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars continuously for four years, taking a data point every 30 minutes. It was looking for what astronomers call a transit. This is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight, just so that the planet crosses in front of a star. And when this happens, it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight, which you can see as a dip in this curve.And so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the Kepler data.At the same time of the first data release, astronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing: What if computers missed something?And so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters to have people look at the same data. The human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition, sometimes even better than a computer. However, there was a lot of skepticism around this. My colleague, Debra Fischer, founder of the Planet Hunters project, said that people at the time were saying, \"You're crazy. There's no way that a computer will miss a signal.\" And so it was on, the classic human versus machine gamble. And if we found one planet, we would be thrilled. When I joined the team four years ago, we had already found a couple. And today, with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts, we have found dozens, and we've also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy.So to understand this, let me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like. On this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light, and on the bottom is time. The white line is light just from the star, what astronomers call a light curve. Now, when a planet transits a star, it blocks out a little bit of this light, and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself. And so, for example, let's take Jupiter. Planets don't get much bigger than Jupiter. Jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star's brightness. Earth, on the other hand, is 11 times smaller than Jupiter, and the signal is barely visible in the data.So back to our mystery. A few years ago, Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits, and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC 8462852. The observations in May of 2009 were the first they spotted, and they started talking about this in the discussion forums.They said and object like Jupiter would make a drop like this in the star's light, but they were also saying it was giant. You see, transits normally only last for a few hours, and this one lasted for almost a week.They were also saying that it looks asymmetric, meaning that instead of the clean, U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter, it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side. This seemed to indicate that whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet. There are few more dips that happened, but for a couple of years, it was pretty quiet.And then in March of 2011, we see this. The star's light drops by a whole 15 percent, and this is huge compared to a planet, which would only make a one percent drop. We described this feature as both smooth and clean. It also is asymmetric, having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week, and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days.And again, after this, not much happens until February of 2013. Things start to get really crazy. There is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear, and they last for like a hundred days, all the way up into the Kepler mission's end. These dips have variable shapes. Some are very sharp, and some are broad, and they also have variable durations. Some last just for a day or two, and some for more than a week. And there's also up and down trends within some of these dips, almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other. And at this time, this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent. This means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth.This is truly remarkable. And so the citizen scientists, when they saw this, they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up. And so when the science team looked at it, we're like, \"Yeah, there's probably just something wrong with the data.\" But we looked really, really, really hard, and the data were good. And so what was happening had to be astrophysical, meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight. And so at this point, we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on. And the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery, they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand.First, somebody said, you know, what if this star was very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it. And then somebody else said, well, what if the star had already formed planets, and two of these planets had collided, similar to the Earth-Moon forming event. Well, both of these theories could explain part of the data, but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young, and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star's light, and you would expect this if the star was young or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced. And so somebody else said, well, how about a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit? Well, it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations. But I agree, it does feel a little contrived. You see, it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing. And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star. And so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets. But of all the bad ideas we had, this one was the best. And so we went ahead and published our findings.Now, let me tell you, this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote. Scientists are meant to publish results, and this situation was far from that. And so we decided to give it a catchy title, and we called it: \"Where's The Flux?\" I will let you work out the acronym.(Laughter)So this isn't the end of the story. Around the same time I was writing this paper, I met with a colleague of mine, Jason Wright, and he was also writing a paper on Kepler data. And he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision, it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars, but it didn't. And then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found, and he said to me, \"Aw crap, Tabby. Now I have to rewrite my paper.\"So yes, the natural explanations were weak, and we were curious now. So we had to find a way to rule out aliens. So together, we convinced a colleague of ours who works on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue. We wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world's largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory.A couple months later, news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles, over 10,000 articles, on this star alone. And if you search Google Images, this is what you'll find.Now, you may be wondering, OK, Tabby, well, how do aliens actually explain this light curve? OK, well, imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own. In this hypothetical circumstance, this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet, so where could they get more energy? Well, they have a host star just like we have a sun, and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star, then that would solve their energy needs. So they would go and build huge structures. These giant megastructures, like ginormous solar panels, are called Dyson spheres.This image above are lots of artists' impressions of Dyson spheres. It's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things, but you can think of it this way. The Earth-Moon distance is a quarter of a million miles. The simplest element on one of these structures is 100 times that size. They're enormous. And now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star. You can see how it would produce anomalies in the data such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.But it remains that even alien megastructures cannot defy the laws of physics. You see, anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat, and we don't observe this. But it could be something as simple as they're just reradiating it away in another direction, just not at Earth.Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?(Laughter)You can see how this quickly captures your imagination.Well, there you have it. We're in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don't understand or an alien technology we don't understand. Personally, as a scientist, my money is on the natural explanation. But don't get me wrong, I do think it would be awesome to find aliens. Either way, there is something new and really interesting to discover.So what happens next? We need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what's happening. But professional astronomers, like me, we have limited resources for this kind of thing, and Kepler is on to a different mission.And I'm happy to say that once again, citizen scientists have come in and saved the day. You see, this time, amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities, and I am so excited to see what they find.What's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren't looking for something like this. And what's more exciting is that there's more data to come. There are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky.And just think: What will it mean when we find another star like this? And what will it mean if we don't find another star like this?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2468, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:17.214\nExtraordinary claims\nrequire extraordinary evidence,\n\n00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:21.934\nand it is my job,\nmy responsibility, as an astronomer\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:28.278\nto remind people that alien hypotheses\nshould always be a last resort.\n\n00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:31.534\nNow, I want to tell you\na story about that.\n\n00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:35.134\nIt involves data from a NASA mission,\n\n00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:40.118\nordinary people and one of the most\nextraordinary stars in our galaxy.\n\n00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:45.358\nIt began in 2009 with the launch\nof NASA's Kepler mission.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.014\nKepler's main scientific objective\n\n00:00:48.038 --> 00:00:51.014\nwas to find planets\noutside of our solar system.\n\n00:00:51.038 --> 00:00:54.614\nIt did this by staring\nat a single field in the sky,\n\n00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:56.478\nthis one, with all the tiny boxes.\n\n00:00:57.438 --> 00:00:58.854\nAnd in this one field,\n\n00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:03.294\nit monitored the brightness\nof over 150,000 stars\n\n00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:05.734\ncontinuously for four years,\n\n00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:08.398\ntaking a data point every 30 minutes.\n\n00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.454\nIt was looking for what\nastronomers call a transit.\n\n00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:18.494\nThis is when the planet's orbit\nis aligned in our line of sight,\n\n00:01:18.518 --> 00:01:22.654\njust so that the planet\ncrosses in front of a star.\n\n00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:27.054\nAnd when this happens,\nit blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,\n\n00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:29.798\nwhich you can see as a dip in this curve.\n\n00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:35.974\nAnd so the team at NASA\nhad developed very sophisticated computers\n\n00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:38.718\nto search for transits\nin all the Kepler data.\n\n00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:44.014\nAt the same time\nof the first data release,\n\n00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:47.158\nastronomers at Yale\nwere wondering an interesting thing:\n\n00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:51.558\nWhat if computers missed something?\n\n00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:56.678\nAnd so we launched the citizen\nscience project called Planet Hunters\n\n00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:00.918\nto have people look at the same data.\n\n00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:05.334\nThe human brain has an amazing ability\nfor pattern recognition,\n\n00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.574\nsometimes even better than a computer.\n\n00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:10.134\nHowever, there was a lot\nof skepticism around this.\n\n00:02:10.158 --> 00:02:13.694\nMy colleague, Debra Fischer,\nfounder of the Planet Hunters project,\n\n00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:15.694\nsaid that people at the time were saying,\n\n00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.838\n\"You're crazy. There's no way\nthat a computer will miss a signal.\"\n\n00:02:19.518 --> 00:02:23.734\nAnd so it was on, the classic\nhuman versus machine gamble.\n\n00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:26.934\nAnd if we found one planet,\nwe would be thrilled.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.414\nWhen I joined the team four years ago,\n\n00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:30.878\nwe had already found a couple.\n\n00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:36.974\nAnd today, with the help\nof over 300,000 science enthusiasts,\n\n00:02:36.998 --> 00:02:38.774\nwe have found dozens,\n\n00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:42.054\nand we've also found\none of the most mysterious stars\n\n00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.278\nin our galaxy.\n\n00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.454\nSo to understand this,\n\n00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:49.678\nlet me show you what a normal transit\nin Kepler data looks like.\n\n00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:54.014\nOn this graph on the left-hand side\nyou have the amount of light,\n\n00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:55.894\nand on the bottom is time.\n\n00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:58.974\nThe white line\nis light just from the star,\n\n00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:01.374\nwhat astronomers call a light curve.\n\n00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:05.254\nNow, when a planet transits a star,\nit blocks out a little bit of this light,\n\n00:03:05.278 --> 00:03:10.734\nand the depth of this transit\nreflects the size of the object itself.\n\n00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:13.374\nAnd so, for example, let's take Jupiter.\n\n00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:15.534\nPlanets don't get\nmuch bigger than Jupiter.\n\n00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:19.334\nJupiter will make a one percent drop\nin a star's brightness.\n\n00:03:19.358 --> 00:03:23.534\nEarth, on the other hand,\nis 11 times smaller than Jupiter,\n\n00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:26.374\nand the signal\nis barely visible in the data.\n\n00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:27.678\nSo back to our mystery.\n\n00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:32.358\nA few years ago, Planet Hunters were\nsifting through data looking for transits,\n\n00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:39.118\nand they spotted a mysterious signal\ncoming from the star KIC 8462852.\n\n00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:43.894\nThe observations in May of 2009\nwere the first they spotted,\n\n00:03:43.918 --> 00:03:46.776\nand they started talking about this\nin the discussion forums.\n\n00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:49.374\nThey said and object like Jupiter\n\n00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:52.294\nwould make a drop like this\nin the star's light,\n\n00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:55.654\nbut they were also saying it was giant.\n\n00:03:55.678 --> 00:03:58.894\nYou see, transits normally\nonly last for a few hours,\n\n00:03:58.918 --> 00:04:01.038\nand this one lasted for almost a week.\n\n00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:05.374\nThey were also saying\nthat it looks asymmetric,\n\n00:04:05.398 --> 00:04:09.654\nmeaning that instead of the clean,\nU-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,\n\n00:04:09.678 --> 00:04:13.174\nit had this strange slope\nthat you can see on the left side.\n\n00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:14.534\nThis seemed to indicate\n\n00:04:14.558 --> 00:04:17.934\nthat whatever was getting in the way\nand blocking the starlight\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.878\nwas not circular like a planet.\n\n00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.094\nThere are few more dips that happened,\n\n00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:25.478\nbut for a couple of years,\nit was pretty quiet.\n\n00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:30.518\nAnd then in March of 2011, we see this.\n\n00:04:31.078 --> 00:04:35.174\nThe star's light drops\nby a whole 15 percent,\n\n00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:37.374\nand this is huge compared to a planet,\n\n00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:39.398\nwhich would only make a one percent drop.\n\n00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:43.974\nWe described this feature\nas both smooth and clean.\n\n00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:46.014\nIt also is asymmetric,\n\n00:04:46.038 --> 00:04:48.694\nhaving a gradual dimming\nthat lasts almost a week,\n\n00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:51.878\nand then it snaps right back up to normal\nin just a matter of days.\n\n00:04:52.878 --> 00:04:57.134\nAnd again, after this, not much happens\n\n00:04:57.158 --> 00:05:00.854\nuntil February of 2013.\n\n00:05:00.878 --> 00:05:03.494\nThings start to get really crazy.\n\n00:05:03.518 --> 00:05:08.014\nThere is a huge complex of dips\nin the light curve that appear,\n\n00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:10.174\nand they last for like a hundred days,\n\n00:05:10.198 --> 00:05:12.438\nall the way up\ninto the Kepler mission's end.\n\n00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:15.214\nThese dips have variable shapes.\n\n00:05:15.238 --> 00:05:17.454\nSome are very sharp, and some are broad,\n\n00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:19.734\nand they also have variable durations.\n\n00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:22.918\nSome last just for a day or two,\nand some for more than a week.\n\n00:05:24.078 --> 00:05:27.414\nAnd there's also up and down trends\nwithin some of these dips,\n\n00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:32.118\nalmost like several independent

that whatever\nis blocking its light\n\n00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:45.725\nhas an area of over 1,000 times\nthe area of our planet Earth.\n\n00:05:46.158 --> 00:05:48.398\nThis is truly remarkable.\n\n00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:51.694\nAnd so the citizen scientists,\nwhen they saw this,\n\n00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:55.414\nthey notified the science team\nthat they found something weird

\"Yeah, there's probably\njust something wrong with the data.\"\n\n00:06:04.123 --> 00:06:06.654\nBut we looked really, really, really hard,\n\n00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:09.078\nand the data were good.\n\n00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:13.734\nAnd so what was happening\nhad to be astrophysical,\n\n00:06:13.758 --> 00:06:17.414\nmeaning that something in space\nwas getting in the way\n\n00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:18.838\nand blocking starlight.\n\n00:06:20.198 --> 00:06:21.414\nAnd so at this point,\n\n00:06:21.438 --> 00:06:24.014\nwe set out to learn\neverything we could about the star\n\n00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:26.958\nto see if we could find any clues\nto what was going on.\n\n00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:30.854\nAnd the citizen scientists\nwho helped us in this discovery,\n\n00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:32.414\nthey joined along for the ride\n\n00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:35.518\nwatching science in action firsthand.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:42.414\nFirst, somebody said, you know,\nwhat if this star was very young\n\n00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:46.038\nand it still had the cloud of material\nit was born from surrounding it.\n\n00:06:46.998 --> 00:06:48.414\nAnd then somebody else said,\n\n00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:51.214\nwell, what if the star\nhad already formed planets,\n\n00:06:51.238 --> 00:06:53.454\nand two of these planets had collided,\n\n00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:55.598\nsimilar to the Earth-Moon forming event.\n\n00:06:56.398 --> 00:06:59.934\nWell, both of these theories\ncould explain part of the data,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.374\nbut the difficulties were that the star\nshowed no signs of being young,\n\n00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:06.334\nand there was no glow\nfrom any of the material\n\n00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:08.454\nthat was heated up by the star's light,\n\n00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:11.334\nand you would expect this\nif the star was young\n\n00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:14.918\nor if there was a collision\nand a lot of dust was produced.\n\n00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:17.374\nAnd so somebody else said,\n\n00:07:17.398 --> 00:07:22.374\nwell, how about a huge swarm of comets\n\n00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:26.054\nthat are passing by this star\nin a very elliptical orbit?\n\n00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:30.478\nWell, it ends up that this is actually\nconsistent with our observations.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.214\nBut I agree, it does feel\na little contrived.\n\n00:07:35.238 --> 00:07:38.534\nYou see, it would take hundreds of comets\n\n00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.198\nto reproduce what we're observing.\n\n00:07:41.158 --> 00:07:42.734\nAnd these are only the comets\n\n00:07:42.758 --> 00:07:45.374\nthat happen to pass\nbetween us and the star.\n\n00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:51.854\nAnd so in reality, we're talking\nthousands to tens of thousands of comets.\n\n00:07:51.878 --> 00:07:55.334\nBut of all the bad ideas we had,\n\n00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:57.494\nthis one was the best.\n\n00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.454\nAnd so we went ahead\nand published our findings.\n\n00:08:00.478 --> 00:08:04.694\nNow, let me tell you, this was one\nof the hardest papers I ever wrote.\n\n00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.054\nScientists are meant to publish results,\n\n00:08:07.078 --> 00:08:09.238\nand this situation was far from that.\n\n00:08:09.918 --> 00:08:13.054\nAnd so we decided\nto give it a catchy title,\n\n00:08:13.078 --> 00:08:15.254\nand we called it: \"Where's The Flux?\"\n\n00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:17.358\nI will let you work out the acronym.\n\n00:08:18.118 --> 00:08:21.838\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.798 --> 00:08:24.494\nSo this isn't the end of the story.\n\n00:08:24.518 --> 00:08:26.694\nAround the same time\nI was writing this paper,\n\n00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:28.854\nI met with a colleague\nof mine, Jason Wright,\n\n00:08:28.878 --> 00:08:31.094\nand he was also writing a paper\non Kepler data.\n\n00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:35.294\nAnd he was saying that with Kepler's\nextreme precision,\n\n00:08:35.318 --> 00:08:40.174\nit could actually detect\nalien megastructures around stars,\n\n00:08:40.198 --> 00:08:41.398\nbut it didn't.\n\n00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:46.438\nAnd then I showed him this weird data\nthat our citizen scientists had found,\n\n00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:48.733\nand he said to me,\n\n00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:50.534\n\"Aw crap, Tabby.\n\n00:08:50.558 --> 00:08:52.517\nNow I have to rewrite my paper.\"\n\n00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:56.598\nSo yes, the natural\nexplanations were weak,\n\n00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:00.014\nand we were curious now.\n\n00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:03.214\nSo we had to find a way\nto rule out aliens.\n\n00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:06.094\nSo together, we convinced\na colleague of ours\n\n00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:09.374\nwho works on SETI, the Search\nfor Extraterrestrial Intelligence,\n\n00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:12.318\nthat this would be\nan extraordinary target to pursue.\n\n00:09:14.438 --> 00:09:16.814\nWe wrote a proposal to observe the star\n\n00:09:16.838 --> 00:09:21.014\nwith the world's largest radio telescope\nat the Green Bank Observatory.\n\n00:09:21.038 --> 00:09:22.414\nA couple months later,\n\n00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:26.678\nnews of this proposal\ngot leaked to the press\n\n00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:31.174\nand now there are thousands of articles,\n\n00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:34.334\nover 10,000 articles, on this star alone.\n\n00:09:34.358 --> 00:09:36.198\nAnd if you search Google Images,\n\n00:09:36.878 --> 00:09:38.078\nthis is what you'll find.\n\n00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:42.054\nNow, you may be wondering,\nOK, Tabby, well,\n\n00:09:42.078 --> 00:09:45.934\nhow do aliens actually explain\nthis light curve?\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.254\nOK, well, imagine a civilization\nthat's much more advanced than our own.\n\n00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.598\nIn this hypothetical circumstance,\n\n00:09:54.638 --> 00:09:59.294\nthis civilization would have exhausted\nthe energy supply of their home planet,\n\n00:09:59.318 --> 00:10:01.494\nso where could they get more energy?\n\n00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:04.318\nWell, they have a host star\njust like we have a sun,\n\n00:10:05.198 --> 00:10:09.254\nand so if they were able\nto capture more energy from this star,\n\n00:10:09.278 --> 00:10:11.238\nthen that would solve their energy needs.\n\n00:10:11.758 --> 00:10:15.174\nSo they would go\nand build huge structures.\n\n00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.974\nThese giant megastructures,\n\n00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:21.718\nlike ginormous solar panels,\nare called Dyson spheres.\n\n00:10:22.398 --> 00:10:23.694\nThis image above\n\n00:10:23.718 --> 00:10:26.894\nare lots of artists' impressions\nof Dyson spheres.\n\n00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:31.934\nIt's really hard to provide perspective\non the vastness of these things,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.774\nbut you can think of it this way.\n\n00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:36.838\nThe Earth-Moon distance\nis a quarter of a million miles.\n\n00:10:37.998 --> 00:10:41.894\nThe simplest element\non one of these structures\n\n00:10:41.918 --> 00:10:44.358\nis 100 times that size.\n\n00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:46.678\nThey're enormous.\n\n00:10:48.038 --> 00:10:52.454\nAnd now imagine one of these structures\nin motion around a star.\n\n00:10:52.478 --> 00:10:55.574\nYou can see how it would produce\nanomalies in the data\n\n00:10:55.598 --> 00:10:58.814\nsuch as uneven, unnatural looking dips.\n\n00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:02.814\nBut it remains that even\nalien megastructures\n\n00:11:02.838 --> 00:11:05.254\ncannot defy the laws of physics.\n\n00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:08.718\nYou see, anything that uses\na lot of energy\n\n00:11:09.758 --> 00:11:11.518\nis going to produce heat,\n\n00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:14.774\nand we don't observe this.\n\n00:11:14.798 --> 00:11:16.494\nBut it could be something as simple\n\n00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:19.974\nas they're just reradiating it away\nin another direction,\n\n00:11:19.998 --> 00:11:21.198\njust not at Earth.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.398\nAnother idea that's one\nof my personal favorites\n\n00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:30.054\nis that we had just witnessed\nan interplanetary space battle\n\n00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:33.078\nand the catastrophic\ndestruction of a planet.\n\n00:11:34.478 --> 00:11:37.734\nNow, I admit that this\nwould produce a lot of dust\n\n00:11:37.758 --> 00:11:39.654\nthat we don't observe.\n\n00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:44.014\nBut if we're already invoking aliens\nin this explanation,\n\n00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:47.734\nthen who is to say they didn't\nefficiently clean up all this mess\n\n00:11:47.758 --> 00:11:49.294\nfor recycling purposes?\n\n00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:50.334\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:50.358 --> 00:11:53.318\nYou can see how this quickly\ncaptures your imagination.\n\n00:11:55.718 --> 00:11:56.974\nWell, there you have it.\n\n00:11:56.998 --> 00:12:00.214\nWe're in a situation that could unfold\n\n00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:03.654\nto be a natural phenomenon\nwe don't understand\n\n00:12:03.678 --> 00:12:06.238\nor an alien technology\nwe don't understand.\n\n00:12:07.558 --> 00:12:12.798\nPersonally, as a scientist,\nmy money is on the natural explanation.\n\n00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:17.318\nBut don't get me wrong, I do think\nit would be awesome to find aliens.\n\n00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:23.278\nEither way, there is something new\nand really interesting to discover.\n\n00:12:23.998 --> 00:12:25.854\nSo what happens next?\n\n00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:28.534\nWe need to continue to observe this star\n\n00:12:28.558 --> 00:12:30.974\nto learn more about what's happening.\n\n00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:33.574\nBut professional astronomers, like me,\n\n00:12:33.598 --> 00:12:36.414\nwe have limited resources\nfor this kind of thing,\n\n00:12:36.438 --> 00:12:38.358\nand Kepler is on to a different mission.\n\n00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:43.574\nAnd I'm happy to say that once again,\n\n00:12:43.598 --> 00:12:46.718\ncitizen scientists have come in\nand saved the day.\n\n00:12:47.838 --> 00:12:50.294\nYou see, this time,\n\n00:12:50.318 --> 00:12:53.198\namateur astronomers\nwith their backyard telescopes\n\n00:12:54.078 --> 00:12:58.054\nstepped up immediately\nand started observing this star nightly\n\n00:12:58.078 --> 00:12:59.574\nat their own facilities,\n\n00:12:59.598 --> 00:13:02.398\nand I am so excited to see what they find.\n\n00:13:03.478 --> 00:13:07.654\nWhat's amazing to me is that this star\nwould have never been found by computers\n\n00:13:07.678 --> 00:13:10.318\nbecause we just weren't looking\nfor something like this.\n\n00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:15.614\nAnd what's more exciting\n\n00:13:15.638 --> 00:13:17.278\nis that there's more data to come.\n\n00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:20.134\nThere are new missions that are coming up\n\n00:13:20.158 --> 00:13:22.838\nthat are observing millions more stars\n\n00:13:23.798 --> 00:13:25.198\nall over the sky.\n\n00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:31.758\nAnd just think: What will it mean\nwhen we find another star like this?\n\n00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:36.558\nAnd what will it mean\nif we don't find another star like this?\n\n00:13:37.238 --> 00:13:38.454\nThank you.\n\n00:13:38.478 -->

What's next?", "duration": "469", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_palmer_the_panama_papers_exposed_a_huge_global_problem_what_s_next", "transcript": "[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.] [The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people] [hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.] [What does this mean?] [We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]This week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca. The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world. We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, \"OK, we want an anonymous company, can you give us one?\" So you actually get to see the emails, you get to see the exchanges of messages, you get to see the mechanics of how this works, how this operates.Now, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions. The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned. We've also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies. There's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend, who happens to be a top cellist. And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents.Now, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel. It seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people. Why should we care about this? But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should, it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare, education, roads. And that affects all of us.Now, for my organization Global Witness, this expos\u00e9 has been phenomenal. We have the world's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets \u2014 something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.Now, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing, and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works. I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll. So you can have one company stacked inside another company, stacked inside another company, making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures. It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities, journalists, civil society to really understand what's going on.I also think it's interesting that there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States. And that's perhaps because some prominent US people just haven't figured in this expos\u00e9, in this scandal. Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore. It's just because of the way in which offshore works, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients. I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada, you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.In fact, in a number of US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card. That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren. It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors. This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.Now, at Global Witness, we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice. How does this actually work? So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms. Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a jet. Now, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds. These were all preliminary meetings, and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands, but it really shows the problem with the system.It's also important to not just think about this as individual cases. This is not just about an individual lawyer who's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions. It's not just about a particular senior politician who's been caught up in a scandal. This is about how a system works, that entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability. And in order to tackle this, we need to change the game. We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder.This may seem like doom and gloom, like there's nothing we can do about it, like nothing has ever changed, like there will always be rich and powerful individuals. But as a natural optimist, I do see that we are starting to get some change.Over the last couple of years, we've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership. This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013. And since then, the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe.One of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind. There's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate, but it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see. So we'd really want to see the Panama leaks, this huge peek into the offshore world, be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change. We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies. We need business leaders to stand up and say, \"Secrecy like this is not good for business.\" We need political leaders to recognize the problem, and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.Together, we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion, corruption, money laundering to flourish.", "id": 2478, "subtitle":

authorities,\njournalists, civil society\n\n00:03:17.586 --> 00:03:19.848\nto really understand what's going on.\n\n00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:21.713\nI also think it's interesting\n\n00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:24.944\nthat there's been less coverage\nof this issue in the United States.\n\n00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:28.731\nAnd that's perhaps because\nsome prominent US people\n\n00:03:28.755 --> 00:03:33.293\njust haven't figured\nin this expos\u00e9, in this scandal.\n\n00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:37.252\nNow, that's not because\nthere are no rich Americans\n\n00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:40.086\nwho are stashing their assets offshore.\n\n00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.932\nIt's just because of the way\nin which offshore works,\n\n00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:47.446\nMossack Fonseca has fewer\nAmerican clients.\n\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.726\nI think if we saw leaks\nfrom the Cayman Islands\n\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.401\nor even from Delaware\nor Wyoming or Nevada,\n\n00:03:54.425 --> 00:04:00.217\nyou would see many more cases\nand examples linking back to Americans.\n\n00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:06.159\nIn fact, in a number of US states\nyou need less information,\n\n00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:10.357\nyou need to provide less\ninformation to get a company\n\n00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:13.174\nthan you do to get a library card.\n\n00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:18.980\nThat sort of secrecy in America\nhas allowed employees of school districts\n\n00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:20.910\nto rip off schoolchildren.\n\n00:04:20.934 --> 00:04:25.830\nIt has allowed scammers\nto rip off vulnerable investors.\n\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.100\nThis is the sort of behavior\nthat affects all of us.\n\n00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:31.995\nNow, at Global Witness,\n\n00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:35.280\nwe wanted to see what this\nactually looked like in practice.\n\n00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:37.717\nHow does this actually work?\n\n00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.916\nSo what we did\n\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.177\nis we sent in an undercover investigator\nto 13 Manhattan law firms.\n\n00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:49.495\nOur investigator posed\nas an African minister\n\n00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:53.646\nwho wanted to move suspect funds\ninto the United States\n\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.809\nto buy a house, a yacht, a jet.\n\n00:04:57.246 --> 00:05:02.307\nNow, what was truly shocking\nwas that all but one of those lawyers\n\n00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:06.924\nprovided our investigator with suggestions\n\n00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:08.912\non how to move those suspect funds.\n\n00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:10.748\nThese were all preliminary meetings,\n\n00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:13.044\nand none of the lawyers\ntook us on as a client\n\n00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:15.357\nand of course no money moved hands,\n\n00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:18.839\nbut it really shows the problem\nwith the system.\n\n00:05:18.863 --> 00:05:20.782\nIt's also important\n\n00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:24.172\nto not just think about this\nas individual cases.\n\n00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:26.409\nThis is not just about\nan individual lawyer\n\n00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:30.287\nwho's spoken to our undercover\ninvestigator and provided suggestions.\n\n00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:33.166\nIt's not just about\na particular senior politician\n\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.819\nwho's been caught up in a scandal.\n\n00:05:34.843 --> 00:05:37.899\nThis is about how a system works,\n\n00:05:37.923 --> 00:05:43.866\nthat entrenches corruption,\ntax evasion, poverty and instability.\n\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.705\nAnd in order to tackle this,\n\n00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.400\nwe need to change the game.\n\n00:05:47.424 --> 00:05:49.946\nWe need to change the rules of the game\n\n00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.962\nto make this sort of behavior harder.\n\n00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:54.930\nThis may seem like doom and gloom,\n\n00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:56.875\nlike there's nothing we can do about it,\n\n00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.529\nlike nothing has ever changed,\n\n00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:01.889\nlike there will always be rich\nand powerful individuals.\n\n00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:04.360\nBut as a natural optimist,\n\n00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:07.862\nI do see that we are starting\nto get some change.\n\n00:06:07.886 --> 00:06:09.761\nOver the last couple of years,\n\n00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:13.453\nwe've seen a real push towards\ngreater transparency\n\n00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:15.311\nwhen it comes to company ownership.\n\n00:06:15.713 --> 00:06:18.050\nThis issue was put on the political agenda\n\n00:06:18.074 --> 00:06:20.568\nby the UK Prime Minister David Cameron\n\n00:06:20.592 --> 00:06:25.352\nat a big G8 Summit that was held\nin Northern Ireland in 2013.\n\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.180\nAnd since then, the European Union\nis going to be creating\n\n00:06:30.204 --> 00:06:32.361\ncentral registers at a national level\n\n00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:35.792\nof who really owns and controls\ncompanies across Europe.\n\n00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:40.495\nOne of the things that is sad is that,\nactually, the US is lagging behind.\n\n00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.616\nThere's bipartisan legislation\nthat had been introduced\n\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.543\nin the House and the Senate,\n\n00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:48.724\nbut it isn't making as much progress\nas we'd like to see.\n\n00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:51.835\nSo we'd really want to see\nthe Panama leaks,\n\n00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:55.653\nthis huge peek into the offshore world,\n\n00:06:55.677 --> 00:07:00.729\nbe used as a way of opening up\nin the US and around the world.\n\n00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:05.543\nFor us at Global Witness,\nthis is a moment for change.\n\n00:07:05.908 --> 00:07:09.656\nWe need ordinary people to get angry\n\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.933\nat the way in which people\ncan hide their identity\n\n00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:14.870\nbehind secret companies.\n\n00:07:14.894 --> 00:07:18.481\nWe need business leaders\nto stand up and say,\n\n00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:21.789\n\"Secrecy like this is not\ngood for business.\"\n\n00:07:21.813 --> 00:07:26.193\nWe need political leaders\nto recognize the problem,\n\n00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:31.224\nand to commit to changing the law\nto open up this sort of secrecy.\n\n00:07:31.597 --> 00:07:34.876\nTogether, we can end the secrecy\n\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.957\nthat is currently allowing tax evasion,\n\n00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:41.172\ncorruption, money laundering to flourish."}, {"title": "The mind behind Linux", "duration": "1290", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux", "transcript": "Chris Anderson: This is such a strange thing. Your software, Linux, is in millions of computers, it probably powers much of the Internet. And I think that there are, like, a billion and a half active Android devices out there. Your software is in every single one of them. It's kind of amazing. You must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this. That's what I thought \u2014 and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it. I mean, this is \u2014 this is the Linux world headquarters.(Laughter)(Applause)Linus Torvalds: It really doesn't look like much. And I have to say, the most interesting part in this picture, that people mostly react to, is the walking desk. It is the most interesting part in my office and I'm not actually using it anymore. And I think the two things are related.The way I work is ... I want to not have external stimulation. You can kind of see, on the walls are this light green. I'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.(Laughter)It's like a calming color, it's not something that really stimulates you.What you can't see is the computer here, you only see the screen, but the main thing I worry about in my computer is \u2014 it doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I like that \u2014 it really has to be completely silent. I know people who work for Google and they have their own small data center at home, and I don't do that. My office is the most boring office you'll ever see. And I sit there alone in the quiet. If the cat comes up, it sits in my lap. And I want to hear the cat purring, not the sound of the fans in the computer.CA: So this is astonishing, because working this way, you're able to run this vast technology empire \u2014 it is an empire \u2014 so that's an amazing testament to the power of open source.Tell us how you got to understand open source and how it lead to the development of Linux.LT: I mean, I still work alone. Really \u2014 I work alone in my house, often in my bathrobe. When a photographer shows up, I dress up, so I have clothes on.(Laughter)And that's how I've always worked. I mean, this was how I started Linux, too. I did not start Linux as a collaborative project. I started it as one in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself, partly because I needed the end result, but even more because I just enjoyed programming. So it was about the end of the journey, which, 25 years later, we still have not reached. But it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.And what happened is ... the project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people. Really, this is more of a, \"Wow, look at what I did!\" And trust me \u2014 it was not that great back then. I made it publicly available, and it wasn't even open source at that point. At that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention behind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today to improve it. It was more like, \"Look, I've been working on this for half a year, I'd love to have comments.\"And other people approached me. At the University of Helsinki, I had a friend who was one of the open source \u2014 it was called mainly \"free software\" back then \u2014 and he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey, you can use these open-source licenses that had been around. And I thought about it for a while. I was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in. I mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have, is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right? And I decided, \"What the hell?\" And \u2014CA: And then at some point, someone contributed some code that you thought, \"Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that. This could actually improve this.\"LT: It didn't even start by people contributing code, it was more that people started contributing ideas. And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project \u2014 and I'm sure it's true of other things, too, but it's definitely true in code \u2014 is that somebody else takes an interest in your code, looks at it enough to actually give you feedback and give you ideas. That was a huge thing for me.I was 21 at the time, so I was young, but I had already programmed for half my life, basically. And every project before that had been completely personal and it was a revelation when people just started commenting, started giving feedback on your code. And even before they started giving code back, that was, I think, one of the big moments where I said, \"I love other people!\" Don't get me wrong \u2014 I'm actually not a people person.(Laughter)I don't really love other people \u2014(Laughter)But I love computers, I love interacting with other people on email, because it kind of gives you that buffer. But I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project. And it made it so much more.CA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built and it suddenly started taking off, and you thought, \"Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge, not just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on, but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world\"?LT: Not really. I mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge, it was when it was becoming little. The big point for me was not being alone and having 10, maybe 100 people being involved \u2014 that was a big point. Then everything else was very gradual. Going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal \u2014 to me. Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're \u2014(Laughter)If you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal \u2014 don't get me wrong. But if you're interested in the technology and you're interested in the project, the big part was getting the community. Then the community grew gradually. And there's actually not a single point where I went like, \"Wow, that just took off!\" because it \u2014 I mean \u2014 it took a long time, relatively.CA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you with massively changing their work. And it's not just Linux, it's this thing called Git, which is this management system for software development. Tell us briefly about that and your role in that.LT: So one of the issues we had, and this took a while to start to appear, is when you ... When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which \u2014 I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel, we have 1,000 people involved in every single release and that's every two months, roughly two or three months. Some of those people don't do a lot. There's a lot of people who make small, small changes.But to maintain this, the scale changes how you have to maintain it. And we went through a lot of pain. And there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance. CVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used, and I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it and tried something else that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated.CA: (Laughs)LT: And we were in this bad spot, where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate, but in many ways, I was the kind of break point, where I could not scale to the point where I could work with thousands of people.So Git is my second big project, which was only created for me to maintain my first big project. And this is literally how I work. I don't code for \u2014 well, I do code for fun \u2014 but I want to code for something meaningful so every single project I've ever done has been something I needed and \u2014CA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have to work with too many people.LT: Absolutely. Yes.(Laughter)CA: That's amazing. LT: Yeah.(Applause)And yet, you're the man who's transformed technology not just once but twice, and we have to try and understand why it is. You've given us some clues, but ... Here's a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik's Cube. You mentioned that you've been programming since you were like 10 or 11, half your life.Were you this sort of computer genius, you know, \u00fcbernerd, were you the star at school who could do everything? What were you like as a kid?LT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd. I mean, I was ... I was not a people person back then. That's my younger brother. I was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube than my younger brother.(Laughter)My younger sister, who's not in the picture, when we had family meetings \u2014 and it's not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins \u2014 she would prep me beforehand. Like, before I stepped into the room she would say, \"OK. That's so-and-so ...\" Because I was not \u2014 I was a geek. I was into computers, I was into math, I was into physics. I was good at that. I don't think I was particularly exceptional. Apparently, my sister said that my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.CA: OK, so let's go there, because that's interesting. You would not let go. So that's not about being a geek and being smart, that's about being ... stubborn?LT: That's about being stubborn. That's about, like, just starting something and not saying, \"OK, I'm done, let's do something else \u2014 Look: shiny!\"And I notice that in many other parts in my life, too. I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years. And I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley, for the whole time. That is unheard of. That's not how Silicon Valley works. The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs to kind of mix up the pot. And that's not the kind of person I am.CA: But during the actual development of Linux itself, that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people. Talk about that a bit. Was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built? How would you describe what happened?LT: I don't know if it's essential. Going back to the \"I'm not a people person,\" \u2014 sometimes I'm also ... shall we say, \"myopic\" when it comes to other people's feelings, and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people. And I'm not proud of that.(Applause)But, at the same time, it's \u2014 I get people who tell me that I should be nice. And then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice, maybe you should be more aggressive, they see that as me being not nice.(Laughter)What I'm trying to say is we are different. I'm not a people person; it's not something I'm particularly proud of, but it's part of me. And one of the things I really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together. We don't have to like each other \u2014 and sometimes we really don't like each other. Really \u2014 I mean, there are very, very heated arguments. But you can, actually, you can find things that \u2014 you don't even agree to disagree, it's just that you're interested in really different things.And coming back to the point where I said earlier that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work, it turned out, and very quickly turned out, that those commercial people were lovely, lovely people. And they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing, and they had completely different goals. And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go. But because it was open source they could do it, and it actually works really beautifully together.And I actually think it works the same way. You need to have the people-people, the communicators, the warm and friendly people who like \u2014(Laughter)really want to hug you and get you into the community. But that's not everybody. And that's not me. I care about the technology. There are people who care about the UI. I can't do UI to save my life. I mean, if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI, I'd die there.(Laughter)So there's different kinds of people, and I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to explain.CA: Now, when we talked last week, you talked about some other trait that you have, which I found really interesting. It's this idea called taste.And I've just got a couple of images here. I think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code, and this one is better taste, which one can immediately see. What is the difference between these two?LT: So this is \u2014 How many people here actually have coded?CA: Oh my goodness.LT: So I guarantee you, everybody who raised their hand, they have done what's called a singly-linked list. And it's taught \u2014 This, the first not very good taste approach, is basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding. And you don't have to understand the code.The most interesting part to me is the last if statement. Because what happens in a singly-linked list \u2014 this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list \u2014 and there's a difference between if it's the first entry or whether it's an entry in the middle. Because if it's the first entry, you have to change the pointer to the first entry. If it's in the middle, you have to change the pointer of a previous entry. So they're two completely different cases.CA: And that's better.LT: And this is better. It does not have the if statement. And it doesn't really matter \u2014 I don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement, but I want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case. And that's good code. But this is simple code. This is CS 101. This is not important \u2014 although, details are important.To me, the sign of people I really want to work with is that they have good taste, which is how ... I sent you this stupid example that is not relevant because it's too small. Good taste is much bigger than this. Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things.CA: OK, so we're putting the pieces together here now. You have taste, in a way that's meaningful to software people. You're \u2014(Laughter)LT: I think it was meaningful to some people here.CA: You're a very smart computer coder, and you're hellish stubborn. But there must be something else. I mean, you've changed the future. You must have the ability of these grand visions of the future. You're a visionary, right?LT: I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED for the last two days, because there's a lot of vision going on, right? And I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan. I'm an engineer. And I think it's really \u2014 I mean \u2014 I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying, \"I want to go there.\" But I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in. This is the kind of person I am.(Cheers)(Applause)CA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys. Who are they and how do you relate to them?LT: Well, so this is kind of clich\u00e9 in technology, the whole Tesla versus Edison, where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man. And people love Tesla. I mean, there are people who name their companies after him.(Laughter)The other person there is Edison, who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian and is \u2014 I mean, his most famous quote is, \"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.\" And I'm in the Edison camp, even if people don't always like him. Because if you actually compare the two, Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days, but who actually changed the world? Edison may not have been a nice person, he did a lot of things \u2014 he was maybe not so intellectual, not so visionary. But I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.CA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams \u2014 big, bold, audacious dreams. You're really the antidote to that.LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.CA: That's good.(Laughter) We embrace you, we embrace you.Companies like Google and many others have made, arguably, like, billions of dollars out of your software. Does that piss you off?LT: No. No, it doesn't piss me off for several reasons. And one of them is, I'm doing fine. I'm really doing fine.But the other reason is \u2014 I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing, Linux would never have been what it is. And it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy, public talking, but at the same time, this is an experience. Trust me. So there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man and thinking I did the right choices.CA: Is the open source idea \u2014 this is, I think we'll end here \u2014 is the open source idea fully realized now in the world, or is there more that it could go, are there more things that it could do?LT: So, I'm of two minds there. I think one reason open source works so well in code is that at the end of the day, code tends to be somewhat black and white. There's often a fairly good way to decide, this is done correctly and this is not done well. Code either works or it doesn't, which means that there's less room for arguments. And we have arguments despite this, right? In many other areas \u2014 I mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that \u2014 and it's really hard sometimes to say that, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas just because the black and white turns into not just gray, but different colors.So, obviously open source in science is making a comeback. Science was there first. But then science ended up being pretty closed, with very expensive journals and some of that going on. And open source is making a comeback in science, with things like arXiv and open journals. Wikipedia changed the world, too. So there are other examples, I'm sure there are more to come.CA: But you're not a visionary, and so it's not up to you to name them.LT: No.(Laughter)It's up to you guys to make them, right?CA: Exactly.Linus Torvalds, thank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet, thank you for all those Android phones.Thank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself.LT: Thank

and I was shocked\nwhen I saw a picture of it.\n\n00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.529\nI mean, this is --\n\n00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:43.803\nthis is the Linux world headquarters.\n\n00:00:43.827 -->

to say,\n\n00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:57.701\nthe most interesting part in this picture,\n\n00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.428\nthat people mostly react to,\n\n00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:00.895\nis the walking

think the two things are related.\n\n00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:11.489\nThe way I work is ...\n\n00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:17.552\nI want to not have external stimulation.\n\n00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:23.395\nYou can kind of see,\non the walls are this light green.\n\n00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:27.883\nI'm told that at mental institutions\nthey use that on the walls.\n\n00:01:27.907 -->

00:01:46.211\nit doesn't have to be big\nand powerful, although I like that --\n\n00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:49.067\nit really has to be completely silent.\n\n00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.944\nI know people

got\nto understand open source\n\n00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:31.896\nand how it lead\nto the development of Linux.\n\n00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:35.009\nLT: I mean, I still work alone.\n\n00:02:35.033 -->

was how I started Linux, too.\n\n00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:52.971\nI did not start Linux\nas a collaborative project.\n\n00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:57.873\nI started it as one\nin a series of many projects\n\n00:02:57.897 --> 00:03:01.854\nI had done at the time for myself,\n\n00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:03.780\npartly because I needed the end result,\n\n00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:06.106\nbut even more because I just\nenjoyed programming.\n\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.504\nSo it was about the end of the journey,\n\n00:03:10.528 --> 00:03:13.874\nwhich, 25 years later,\nwe still have not reached.\n\n00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:17.615\nBut it was really about the fact\nthat I was looking for a project on my own\n\n00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.468\nand there was no open source,\nreally, on my radar at all.\n\n00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd what happened is ...\n\n00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:29.178\nthe project grows and becomes something\nyou want to show off to people.\n\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.627\nReally, this is more of a, \"Wow,\nlook at what I did!\"\n\n00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:37.206\nAnd trust me -- it was not\nthat great back then.\n\n00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:39.960\nI made it publicly available,\n\n00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:42.090\nand it wasn't even\nopen source at that point.\n\n00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:47.283\nAt that point it was source that was open,\nbut there was no intention\n\n00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:52.421\nbehind using the kind of open-source\nmethodology that we think of today\n\n00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:53.596\nto improve it.\n\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.771\nIt was more like,\n\n00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:57.732\n\"Look, I've been working\non this for half a year,\n\n00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:00.156\nI'd love to have comments.\"\n\n00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.675\nAnd other people approached me.\n\n00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:04.827\nAt the University of Helsinki,\n\n00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:08.566\nI had a friend who was one\nof the open source --\n\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.246\nit was called mainly\n\"free software\" back then --\n\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.544\nand he actually introduced me\nto the notion that, hey,\n\n00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:21.925\nyou can use these open-source\nlicenses that had been around.\n\n00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:26.113\nAnd I thought about it for a while.\n\n00:04:26.137 --> 00:04:29.628\nI was actually worried about the whole\ncommercial interests coming in.\n\n00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:34.126\nI mean, that's one of the worries\nI think most people who start out have,\n\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.110\nis that they worry about somebody\ntaking advantage of their work, right?\n\n00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:42.817\nAnd I decided, \"What the hell?\"\n\n00:04:43.698 --> 00:04:44.848\nAnd --\n\n00:04:44.872 --> 00:04:46.167\nCA: And then at some point,\n\n00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:48.651\nsomeone contributed\nsome code that you thought,\n\n00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:51.846\n\"Wow, that really is interesting,\nI would not have thought of that.\n\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.521\nThis could actually improve this.\"\n\n00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:56.070\nLT: It didn't even start\nby people contributing code,\n\n00:04:56.094 --> 00:04:59.073\nit was more that people\nstarted contributing ideas.\n\n00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:02.952\nAnd just the fact that somebody else\ntakes a look at your project --\n\n00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:05.524\nand I'm sure it's true\nof other things, too,\n\n00:05:05.548 --> 00:05:07.385\nbut it's definitely true in code --\n\n00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.908\nis that somebody else\ntakes an interest in your code,\n\n00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:13.454\nlooks at it enough to actually\ngive you feedback\n\n00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:15.367\nand give you ideas.\n\n00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:17.092\nThat was a huge thing for me.\n\n00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:20.308\nI was 21 at the time, so I was young,\n\n00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:23.569\nbut I had already programmed\nfor half my life, basically.\n\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.302\nAnd every project before that\nhad been completely personal\n\n00:05:28.326 --> 00:05:31.433\nand it was a revelation when people\njust started commenting,\n\n00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:34.758\nstarted giving feedback on your code.\n\n00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:38.554\nAnd even before they started\ngiving code back,\n\n00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:41.319\nthat was, I think, one of the big\nmoments where I said,\n\n00:05:41.343 --> 00:05:43.216\n\"I love other people!\"\n\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.397\nDon't get

email,\n\n00:05:56.967 --> 00:06:00.299\nbecause it kind of gives you that buffer.\n\n00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:06.824\nBut I do love other people who comment\nand get involved in my project.\n\n00:06:06.848 --> 00:06:08.501\nAnd it made it so much more.\n\n00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.065\nCA: So was there a moment\nwhen you saw what was being built\n\n00:06:12.089 -->

little.\n\n00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:37.184\nThe big point for me was not being alone\n\n00:06:37.208 --> 00:06:40.925\nand having 10, maybe 100\npeople being involved --\n\n00:06:40.949 -->

arose\n\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.606\nalmost as an unintended consequence\n\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.301\nof your desire not to have\nto work with too many people.\n\n00:09:18.325 -->

That's so-and-so ...\"\n\n00:10:25.883 --> 00:10:28.212\nBecause I was not --\n\n00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:29.451\nI was a geek.\n\n00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:30.641\nI was into computers,\n\n00:10:30.665

was\nparticularly exceptional.\n\n00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.903\nApparently, my sister said\n\n00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:46.778\nthat my biggest exceptional quality\nwas that I would not let go.\n\n00:10:47.576 --> 00:10:50.133\nCA: OK, so let's go there,\nbecause that's interesting.\n\n00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:51.331\nYou would not let go.\n\n00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:54.220\nSo that's not about being\na geek and being smart,\n\n00:10:54.244 --> 00:10:57.349\nthat's about being ... stubborn?\n\n00:10:57.373 --> 00:10:58.900\nLT: That's about being stubborn.\n\n00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.312\nThat's about, like,\n\n00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:03.251\njust starting something\n\n00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:08.725\nand not saying, \"OK, I'm done,\nlet's do something else

Valley for seven years.\n\n00:11:18.702 --> 00:11:22.814\nAnd I worked for the same\ncompany, in Silicon Valley,\n\n00:11:22.838 --> 00:11:24.552\nfor the whole time.\n\n00:11:24.576 --> 00:11:26.114\nThat is unheard of.\n\n00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:28.929\nThat's not how Silicon Valley works.\n\n00:11:28.953 --> 00:11:32.532\nThe whole point of Silicon Valley\nis that people jump between jobs\n\n00:11:32.556 --> 00:11:35.183\nto kind of mix up the pot.\n\n00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:37.087\nAnd that's not the kind of person I am.\n\n00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:39.682\nCA: But during the actual\ndevelopment of Linux itself,\n\n00:11:39.706 --> 00:11:44.002\nthat stubbornness sometimes brought\nyou in conflict with other people.\n\n00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:46.057\nTalk about that a bit.\n\n00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:51.625\nWas that essential to sort of maintain\nthe quality of what was being built?\n\n00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:53.814\nHow would you describe what happened?\n\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.433\nLT: I don't know if it's essential.\n\n00:11:57.197 --> 00:12:00.342\nGoing back to the \"I'm not\na people person,\" --\n\n00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:02.154\nsometimes I'm also ...\n\n00:12:04.058 --> 00:12:05.591\nshall we say,\n\n00:12:05.615 --> 00:12:09.035\n\"myopic\" when it comes\nto other people's feelings,\n\n00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:14.903\nand that sometimes makes you\nsay things that hurt other people.\n\n00:12:14.927 --> 00:12:18.695\nAnd I'm not proud of that.\n\n00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:19.833\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:19.857 --> 00:12:21.655\nBut, at the same time, it's --\n\n00:12:22.936 --> 00:12:26.012\nI get people who tell me\nthat I should be nice.\n\n00:12:26.754 --> 00:12:32.422\nAnd then when I try to explain to them\nthat maybe you're nice,\n\n00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:34.700\nmaybe you should be more aggressive,\n\n00:12:34.724 --> 00:12:38.266\nthey see that as me being not nice.\n\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.400\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:42.592\nWhat I'm trying to say\nis we are different.\n\n00:12:42.616 --> 00:12:44.426\nI'm not a people person;\n\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.556\nit's not something\nI'm particularly proud of,\n\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.120\nbut it's part of me.\n\n00:12:48.144 --> 00:12:50.849\nAnd one of the things\nI really like about open source\n\n00:12:50.873 --> 00:12:56.665\nis it really allows different\npeople to work together.\n\n00:12:56.689 --> 00:12:58.413\nWe don't have to like each other --\n\n00:12:58.437 --> 00:13:00.640\nand sometimes we really\ndon't like each other.\n\n00:13:00.664 --> 00:13:04.151\nReally -- I mean, there are very,\nvery heated arguments.\n\n00:13:04.175 --> 00:13:07.167\nBut you can, actually,\nyou can find things that --\n\n00:13:08.285 --> 00:13:10.512\nyou don't even agree to disagree,\n\n00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:13.582\nit's just that you're interested\nin really different things.\n\n00:13:13.606 --> 00:13:16.509\nAnd coming back to the point\nwhere I said earlier\n\n00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:20.826\nthat I was afraid of commercial people\ntaking advantage of your work,\n\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.449\nit turned out, and very\nquickly turned out,\n\n00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:26.439\nthat those commercial people\nwere lovely, lovely people.\n\n00:13:26.463 --> 00:13:30.169\nAnd they did all the things that I was not\nat all interested in doing,\n\n00:13:30.193 --> 00:13:32.250\nand they had completely different goals.\n\n00:13:32.274 --> 00:13:37.597\nAnd they used open source in ways\nthat I just did not want to go.\n\n00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:39.883\nBut because it was open\nsource they could do it,\n\n00:13:39.907 --> 00:13:42.259\nand it actually works\nreally beautifully together.\n\n00:13:42.283 --> 00:13:44.307\nAnd I actually think\nit works the same way.\n\n00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:47.536\nYou need to have the people-people,\nthe communicators,\n\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.987\nthe warm and friendly people\n\n00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:50.733\nwho like --\n\n00:13:50.757 --> 00:13:52.199\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:52.223 --> 00:13:55.273\nreally want to hug you\nand get you into the community.\n\n00:13:55.297 --> 00:13:56.868\nBut that's not everybody.\n\n00:13:56.892 --> 00:13:58.324\nAnd that's not me.\n\n00:13:58.348 --> 00:13:59.805\nI care about the technology.\n\n00:13:59.829 --> 00:14:01.710\nThere are people who care about the UI.\n\n00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:04.804\nI can't do UI to save my life.\n\n00:14:04.828 --> 00:14:07.849\nI mean, if I was stranded on an island\n\n00:14:07.873 --> 00:14:11.273\nand the only way to get off that island\nwas the make a pretty UI,\n\n00:14:11.297 --> 00:14:12.460\nI'd die there.\n\n00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:13.635\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:15.798\nSo there's different kinds of people,\n\n00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:18.687\nand I'm not making excuses,\nI'm trying to explain.\n\n00:14:18.711 --> 00:14:20.377\nCA: Now, when we talked last week,\n\n00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.886\nyou talked about some\nother trait that you have,\n\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.501\nwhich I found really interesting.\n\n00:14:24.525 --> 00:14:25.908\nIt's this idea called taste.\n\n00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:27.934\nAnd I've just got a couple of images here.\n\n00:14:28.312 --> 00:14:32.315\nI think this is an example of not\nparticularly good taste in code,\n\n00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:35.330\nand this one is better taste,\n\n00:14:35.354 --> 00:14:37.417\nwhich one can immediately see.\n\n00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:39.414\nWhat is the difference between these two?\n\n00:14:40.597 --> 00:14:41.779\nLT: So this is --\n\n00:14:41.803 --> 00:14:44.480\nHow many people here actually have coded?\n\n00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:47.149\nCA: Oh my goodness.\n\n00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:48.328\nLT: So I guarantee you,\n\n00:14:48.352 --> 00:14:49.897\neverybody who raised their hand,\n\n00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:52.542\nthey have done what's called\na singly-linked list.\n\n00:14:52.566 --> 00:14:54.575\nAnd it's taught --\n\n00:14:55.073 --> 00:14:58.664\nThis, the first not very\ngood taste approach,\n\n00:14:58.688 --> 00:15:02.755\nis basically how it's taught to be done\nwhen you start out coding.\n\n00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:04.823\nAnd you don't have to understand the code.\n\n00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:06.903\nThe most interesting part to me\n\n00:15:06.927 --> 00:15:09.116\nis the last if statement.\n\n00:15:10.891 --> 00:15:13.151\nBecause what happens\nin a singly-linked list --\n\n00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:16.825\nthis is trying to remove\nan existing entry from a list --\n\n00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:20.691\nand there's a difference\nbetween if it's the first entry\n\n00:15:20.715 --> 00:15:22.714\nor whether it's an entry in the middle.\n\n00:15:22.738 --> 00:15:24.343\nBecause if it's the first entry,\n\n00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:27.383\nyou have to change\nthe pointer to the first entry.\n\n00:15:27.407 --> 00:15:28.605\nIf it's in the middle,\n\n00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:31.050\nyou have to change the pointer\nof a previous entry.\n\n00:15:31.074 --> 00:15:33.098\nSo they're two completely different cases.\n\n00:15:33.122 --> 00:15:34.274\nCA: And that's better.\n\n00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:35.479\nLT: And this is better.\n\n00:15:35.898 --> 00:15:38.221\nIt does not have the if statement.\n\n00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:40.808\nAnd it doesn't really matter --\n\n00:15:40.832 --> 00:15:44.033\nI don't want you understand\nwhy it doesn't have the if statement,\n\n00:15:44.057 --> 00:15:45.399\nbut I want you to understand\n\n00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:48.048\nthat sometimes you can see\na problem in a different way\n\n00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:51.426\nand rewrite it so that\na special case goes away\n\n00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.327\nand becomes the normal case.\n\n00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:54.890\nAnd that's good code.\n\n00:15:55.286 --> 00:15:56.836\nBut this is simple code.\n\n00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.209\nThis is CS 101.\n\n00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:01.089\nThis is not important --\nalthough, details are important.\n\n00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:05.834\nTo me, the sign of people\nI really want to work with\n\n00:16:05.858 --> 00:16:08.531\nis that they have good taste,\nwhich is how ...\n\n00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:10.850\nI sent you this stupid example\n\n00:16:10.874 --> 00:16:13.218\nthat is not relevant\nbecause it's too small.\n\n00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:15.843\nGood taste is much bigger than this.\n\n00:16:15.867 --> 00:16:19.888\nGood taste is about really\nseeing the big patterns\n\n00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:24.370\nand kind of instinctively knowing\nwhat's the right way to do things.\n\n00:16:24.394 --> 00:16:27.051\nCA: OK, so we're putting\nthe pieces together here now.\n\n00:16:27.694 --> 00:16:29.161\nYou have taste,\n\n00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:32.352\nin a way that's meaningful\nto software people.\n\n00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:33.527\nYou're --\n\n00:16:33.551 -->

00:17:19.491\nand I want to fix the pothole\nthat's right in front of me\n\n00:17:19.515 --> 00:17:20.875\nbefore I fall in.\n\n00:17:20.899 --> 00:17:22.518\nThis is the kind of person I am.\n\n00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:23.653\n(Cheers)\n\n00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:24.989\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:28.624\nCA: So you spoke to me last week\nabout these two guys.\n\n00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:31.751\nWho are they and how\ndo you relate to them?\n\n00:17:32.197 --> 00:17:35.799\nLT: Well, so this is kind\nof clich\u00e9 in technology,\n\n00:17:35.823 --> 00:17:37.830\nthe whole Tesla versus Edison,\n\n00:17:37.854 --> 00:17:42.795\nwhere Tesla is seen as the visionary\nscientist and crazy idea man.\n\n00:17:42.819 --> 00:17:45.601\nAnd people love Tesla.\n\n00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:48.612\nI mean, there are people who name\ntheir companies after him.\n\n00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:49.786\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:51.323 --> 00:17:53.935\nThe other person there is Edison,\n\n00:17:53.959 --> 00:17:57.466\nwho is actually often vilified\nfor being kind of pedestrian\n\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.411\nand is --\n\n00:17:59.435 --> 00:18:02.157\nI mean, his most famous quote is,\n\n00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:06.895\n\"Genius is one percent inspiration\nand 99 percent perspiration.\"\n\n00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:08.805\nAnd I'm in the Edison camp,\n\n00:18:08.829 --> 00:18:11.013\neven if people don't always like him.\n\n00:18:11.037 --> 00:18:14.056\nBecause if you actually compare the two,\n\n00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.613\nTesla has kind of this mind\ngrab these days,\n\n00:18:18.637 --> 00:18:20.636\nbut who actually changed the world?\n\n00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:25.193\nEdison may not have been a nice person,\n\n00:18:25.217 --> 00:18:28.349\nhe did a lot of things --\n\n00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:30.802\nhe was maybe not so intellectual,\n\n00:18:30.826 --> 00:18:33.053\nnot so visionary.\n\n00:18:33.077 --> 00:18:36.738\nBut I think I'm more\nof an Edison than a Tesla.\n\n00:18:37.627 --> 00:18:40.065\nCA: So our theme at TED\nthis week is dreams --\n\n00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:41.436\nbig, bold, audacious dreams.\n\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.262\nYou're really the antidote to that.\n\n00:18:43.286 --> 00:18:45.395\nLT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.\n\n00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:46.570\nCA: That's good.\n\n00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:47.674\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:47.698 --> 00:18:49.303\nWe embrace you, we embrace you.\n\n00:18:51.004 --> 00:18:53.753\nCompanies like Google and many\nothers have made, arguably,\n\n00:18:53.777 --> 00:18:55.983\nlike, billions of dollars\nout of your software.\n\n00:18:56.007 --> 00:18:57.158\nDoes that piss you off?\n\n00:18:57.182 --> 00:18:58.333\nLT: No.\n\n00:18:58.357 --> 00:19:00.991\nNo, it doesn't piss me off\nfor several reasons.\n\n00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:03.025\nAnd one of them is, I'm doing fine.\n\n00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:04.345\nI'm really doing fine.\n\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.484\nBut the other reason is --\n\n00:19:06.508 --> 00:19:11.835\nI mean, without doing the whole\nopen source and really letting go thing,\n\n00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:14.085\nLinux would never have been what it is.\n\n00:19:14.109 --> 00:19:19.205\nAnd it's brought experiences\nI don't really enjoy, public talking,\n\n00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:21.380\nbut at the same time,\nthis is an experience.\n\n00:19:21.404 --> 00:19:22.684\nTrust me.\n\n00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:28.339\nSo there's a lot of things going on\nthat make me a very happy man\n\n00:19:28.363 --> 00:19:30.892\nand thinking I did the right choices.\n\n00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:32.828\nCA: Is the open source idea --\n\n00:19:32.852 --> 00:19:34.488\nthis is, I think we'll end here --\n\n00:19:34.512 --> 00:19:38.566\nis the open source idea\nfully realized now in the world,\n\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.608\nor is there more that it could go,\n\n00:19:41.632 --> 00:19:43.647\nare there more things that it could do?\n\n00:19:44.696 --> 00:19:46.930\nLT: So, I'm of two minds there.\n\n00:19:46.954 --> 00:19:51.440\nI think one reason open source\nworks so well in code\n\n00:19:51.464 --> 00:19:53.873\nis that at the end of the day,\n\n00:19:53.897 --> 00:19:57.143\ncode tends to be somewhat black and white.\n\n00:19:57.167 --> 00:20:01.324\nThere's often a fairly good way to decide,\n\n00:20:01.348 --> 00:20:05.294\nthis is done correctly\nand this is not done well.\n\n00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:07.696\nCode either works or it doesn't,\n\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.328\nwhich means that there's less\nroom for arguments.\n\n00:20:12.352 --> 00:20:15.983\nAnd we have arguments despite this, right?\n\n00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:17.922\nIn many other areas --\n\n00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:21.687\nI mean, people have talked about\nopen politics and things like that --\n\n00:20:21.711 --> 00:20:24.660\nand it's really hard sometimes to say\n\n00:20:24.684 --> 00:20:28.441\nthat, yes, you can apply the same\nprinciples in some other areas\n\n00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:33.904\njust because the black and white\nturns into not just gray,\n\n00:20:33.928 --> 00:20:35.531\nbut different colors.\n\n00:20:36.297 --> 00:20:40.663\nSo, obviously open source in science\nis making a comeback.\n\n00:20:40.687 --> 00:20:42.321\nScience was there first.\n\n00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:45.012\nBut then science ended up\nbeing pretty closed,\n\n00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:48.660\nwith very expensive journals\nand some of that going on.\n\n00:20:48.684 --> 00:20:52.520\nAnd open source is making\na comeback in science,\n\n00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:56.691\nwith things like arXiv and open journals.\n\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.173\nWikipedia changed the world, too.\n\n00:21:01.197 --> 00:21:02.651\nSo there are other examples,\n\n00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:04.308\nI'm sure there are more to come.\n\n00:21:05.618 --> 00:21:07.185\nCA: But you're not a visionary,\n\n00:21:07.209 --> 00:21:09.162\nand so it's not up to you to name them.\n\n00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:10.345\nLT: No.\n\n00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:11.417\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:11.441 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/hugh_evans_what_does_it_mean_to_be_a_citizen_of_the_world", "transcript": "I want to introduce you to an amazing woman. Her name is Davinia. Davinia was born in Jamaica, emigrated to the US at the age of 18, and now lives just outside of Washington, DC. She's not a high-powered political staffer, nor a lobbyist. She'd probably tell you she's quite unremarkable, but she's having the most remarkable impact. What's incredible about Davinia is that she's willing to spend time every single week focused on people who are not her: people not her in her neighborhood, her state, nor even in her country \u2014 people she'd likely never meet.Davinia's impact started a few years ago when she reached out to all of her friends on Facebook, and asked them to donate their pennies so she could fund girls' education. She wasn't expecting a huge response, but 700,000 pennies later, she's now sent over 120 girls to school. When we spoke last week, she told me she's become a little infamous at the local bank every time she rocks up with a shopping cart full of pennies.Now \u2014 Davinia is not alone. Far from it. She's part of a growing movement. And there's a name for people like Davinia: global citizens. A global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost not as a member of a state, a tribe or a nation, but as a member of the human race, and someone who is prepared to act on that belief, to tackle our world's greatest challenges. Our work is focused on finding, supporting and activating global citizens. They exist in every country and among every demographic.I want to make the case to you today that the world's future depends on global citizens. I'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world, then every single one of the major challenges we face \u2014 from poverty, climate change, gender inequality \u2014 these issues become solvable. They are ultimately global issues, and they can ultimately only be solved by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders.Now, some people's immediate reaction to this idea is that it's either a bit utopian or even threatening. So I'd like to share with you a little of my story today, how I ended up here, how it connects with Davinia and, hopefully, with you.Growing up in Melbourne, Australia, I was one of those seriously irritating little kids that never, ever stopped asking, \"Why?\" You might have been one yourself. I used to ask my mum the most annoying questions. I'd ask her questions like, \"Mum, why I can't I dress up and play with puppets all day?\" \"Why do you want fries with that?\" \"What is a shrimp, and why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie?\"(Laughter)\"And mum \u2014 this haircut. Why?\"(Laughter)The worst haircut, I think. Still terrible.As a \"why\" kid, I thought I could change the world, and it was impossible to convince me otherwise. And when I was 12 and in my first year of high school, I started raising money for communities in the developing world. We were a really enthusiastic group of kids, and we raised more money than any other school in Australia. And so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more. It was 1998. We were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila. It was there I became friends with Sonny Boy, who lived on what was literally a pile of steaming garbage. \"Smoky Mountain\" was what they called it. But don't let the romance of that name fool you, because it was nothing more than a rancid landfill that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours rummaging through every single day to find something, anything of value.That night with Sonny Boy and his family changed my life forever, because when it came time to go to sleep, we simply laid down on this concrete slab the size of half my bedroom with myself, Sonny Boy, and the rest of his family, seven of us in this long line, with the smell of rubbish all around us and cockroaches crawling all around. And I didn't sleep a wink, but I lay awake thinking to myself, \"Why should anyone have to live like this when I have so much? Why should Sonny Boy's ability to live out his dreams be determined by where he's born, or what Warren Buffett called 'the ovarian lottery?'\" I just didn't get it, and I needed to understand why.Now, I only later came to understand that the poverty I'd seen in the Philippines was the result of decisions made or not made, man-made, by a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments who had anything but the interests of Sonny Boy at heart. Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, but they may as well have. And if we're to try to help kids like Sonny Boy, it wouldn't work just to try to send him a few dollars or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived, because the core of the problem lay elsewhere. And as I worked on community development projects over the coming years trying to help build schools, train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS, I came to see that community development should be driven by communities themselves, and that although charity is necessary, it's not sufficient. We need to confront these challenges on a global scale and in a systemic way. And the best thing I could do is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change.That's why, a few years later, I joined with a group of college friends in bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia. We had this dream of staging this small concert around the time of the G20 with local Aussie artists, and it suddenly exploded one day when we got a phone call from Bono, the Edge and Pearl Jam, who all agreed to headline our concert. I got a little bit excited that day, as you can see.(Laughter)But to our amazement, the Australian government heard our collective voices, and they agreed to double investment into global health and development \u2014 an additional 6.2 billion dollars. It felt like \u2014(Applause)It felt like this incredible validation. By rallying citizens together, we helped persuade our government to do the unthinkable, and act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders.But here's the thing: it didn't last. See, there was a change in government, and six years later, all that new money disappeared. What did we learn? We learned that one-off spikes are not enough. We needed a sustainable movement, not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic downturn. And it needed to happen everywhere; otherwise, every individual government would have this built-in excuse mechanism that they couldn't possibly carry the burden of global action alone.And so this is what we embarked upon. And as we embarked upon this challenge, we asked ourselves, how do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army to win these fights for the long term? We could only think of one way. We needed to somehow turn that short-term excitement of people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign into long-term passion. It had to be part of their identity. So in 2012, we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal. And there was only one name for it: Global Citizen.But this is not about any one organization. This is about citizens taking action. And research data tells us that of the total population who even care about global issues, only 18 percent have done anything about it. It's not that people don't want to act. It's often that they don't know how to take action, or that they believe that their actions will have no effect. So we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens in dozens of countries to put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically.And as we did so, we discovered something really thrilling, that when you make global citizenship your mission, you suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies. See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue that's fundamentally global. So, too, is climate change, human rights, gender equality, even conflict. We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated issues.But how did we actually go about recruiting and engaging those global citizens? Well, we used the universal language: music. We launched the Global Citizen Festival in the heart of New York City in Central Park, and we persuaded some of the world's biggest artists to participate. We made sure that these festivals coincided with the UN General Assembly meeting, so that leaders who need to hear our voices couldn't possible ignore them.But there was a twist: you couldn't buy a ticket. You had to earn it. You had to take action on behalf of a global cause, and only once you'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify. Activism is the currency. I had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel-good thing. For me, citizenship means you have to act, and that's what we required. And amazingly, it worked. Last year, more than 155,000 citizens in the New York area alone earned enough points to qualify. Globally, we've now signed up citizens in over 150 countries around the world. And last year, we signed up more than 100,000 new members each and every week of the whole year.See, we don't need to create global citizens from nothing. We're already everywhere. We just need to be organized and motivated to start acting. And this is where I believe we can learn a lot from Davinia, who started taking action as a global citizen back in 2012. Here's what she did. It wasn't rocket science. She started writing letters, emailing politicians' offices. She volunteered her time in her local community. That's when she got active on social media and started to collect pennies \u2014 a lot of pennies.Now, maybe that doesn't sound like a lot to you. How will that achieve anything? Well, it achieved a lot because she wasn't alone. Her actions, alongside 142,000 other global citizens', led the US government to double their investment into Global Partnership for Education. And here's Dr. Raj Shah, the head of USAID, making that announcement. See, when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other, it's amazing to see their collective power. Global citizens like Davinia helped persuade the World Bank to boost their investment into water and sanitation. Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim announcing 15 billion dollars onstage at Global Citizen, and Prime Minister Modi of India affirmed his commitment to put a toilet in every household and school across India by 2019. Global citizens encouraged by the late-night host Stephen Colbert launched a Twitter invasion on Norway. Erna Solberg, the country's Prime Minister, got the message, committing to double investment into girls' education. Global citizens together with Rotarians called on the Canadian, UK, and Australian governments to boost their investment into polio eradication. They got together and committed 665 million dollars.But despite all of this momentum, we face some huge challenges. See, you might be thinking to yourself, how can we possibly persuade world leaders to sustain a focus on global issues? Indeed, the powerful American politician Tip O'Neill once said, \"All politics is local.\" That's what always got politicians elected: to seek, gain and hold onto power through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests.I experienced this for the first time when I was 21 years old. I took a meeting with a then-Australian Foreign Minister who shall remain nameless \u2014[Alexander Downer](Laughter)And behind closed doors, I shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty. I said, \"Minister \u2014 Australia has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We can do this.\" And he paused, looked down on me with cold, dismissive eyes, and he said, \"Hugh, no one gives a funk about foreign aid.\" Except he didn't use the word \"funk.\" He went on. He said we need to look after our own backyard first.This is, I believe, outdated, even dangerous thinking. Or as my late grandfather would say, complete BS. Parochialism offers this false dichotomy because it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another. It pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another. The whole world is our backyard, and we ignore it at our peril. See, look what happened when we ignored Rwanda, when we ignore Syria, when we ignore climate change. Political leaders ought to give a \"funk\" because the impact of climate change and extreme poverty comes right to our shore.Now, global citizens \u2014 they understand this. We live in a time that favors the global citizen, in an age where every single voice can be heard. See, do you remember when the Millennium Development Goals were signed back in the year 2000? The most we could do in those days was fire off a letter and wait for the next election. There was no social media. Today, billions of citizens have more tools, more access to information, more capacity to influence than ever before. Both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us. The world has changed, and those of us who look beyond our borders are on the right side of history.So where are we? So we run this amazing festival, we've scored some big policy wins, and citizens are signing up all over the world. But have we achieved our mission? No. We have such a long way to go.But this is the opportunity that I see. The concept of global citizenship, self-evident in its logic but until now impractical in many ways, has coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live. We, as global citizens, now have a unique opportunity to accelerate large-scale positive change around the world. So in the months and years ahead, global citizens will hold world leaders accountable to ensure that the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development are tracked and implemented. Global citizens will partner with the world's leading NGOs to end diseases like polio and malaria. Global citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe, increasing the frequency, quality and impact of their actions. These dreams are within reach. Imagine an army of millions growing into tens of millions, connected, informed, engaged and unwilling to take no for an answer.Over all these years, I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy. Sadly, I've been unable to. We met long before social media, and his address has now been relocated by the authorities, as often happens with slums. I'd love to sit down with him, wherever he is, and share with him how much the time I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me. Thanks to him and so many others, I came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people \u2014 the kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world, the global citizens. Global citizens who stand together, who ask the question \"Why?,\" who reject the naysayers, and embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share.I'm a global citizen.Are you?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2477, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:15.148\nI want to introduce you\nto an amazing woman.\n\n00:00:15.648 -->

impact started a few years ago\n\n00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:54.657\nwhen she reached out\nto all of her friends on Facebook,\n\n00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:56.864\nand asked them to donate their pennies\n\n00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:59.331\nso she could fund girls' education.\n\n00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:01.762\nShe wasn't expecting a huge response,\n\n00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:04.569\nbut 700,000 pennies later,\n\n00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:07.909\nshe's now sent over 120 girls to school.\n\n00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.120\nWhen we spoke last week,\n\n00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:12.182\nshe told me she's become\na little infamous at the local bank\n\n00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:16.484\nevery time she rocks up\nwith a shopping cart full of pennies.\n\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.566\nNow -- Davinia is not alone.\n\n00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.272\nFar from it.\n\n00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:23.961\nShe's part of a growing movement.\n\n00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:26.018\nAnd there's a name\nfor people like Davinia:\n\n00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:28.058\nglobal citizens.\n\n00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:33.364\nA global citizen is someone\nwho self-identifies first and foremost\n\n00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:37.190\nnot as a member of a state,\na tribe or a nation,\n\n00:01:37.214 --> 00:01:39.401\nbut as a member of the human race,\n\n00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:44.265\nand someone who is prepared\nto act on that belief,\n\n00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.184\nto tackle our world's greatest challenges.\n\n00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.661\nOur work is focused on finding,\n\n00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.568\nsupporting and activating global citizens.\n\n00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:54.490\nThey exist in every country\n\n00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.417\nand among every demographic.\n\n00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.728\nI want to make the case to you today\n\n00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.830\nthat the world's future depends\non global citizens.\n\n00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:06.156\nI'm convinced that if we had\nmore global citizens active in our world,\n\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.915\nthen every single one\nof the major challenges we face --\n\n00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.537\nfrom poverty, climate change,\ngender inequality --\n\n00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:14.745\nthese issues become solvable.\n\n00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.365\nThey are ultimately global issues,\n\n00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.270\nand they can ultimately only be solved\n\n00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:23.689\nby global citizens demanding\nglobal solutions from their leaders.\n\n00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.190\nNow, some people's immediate\nreaction to this idea\n\n00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:31.082\nis that it's either a bit utopian\nor even threatening.\n\n00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.574\nSo I'd like to share with you\na little of my story today,\n\n00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:36.309\nhow I ended up here,\n\n00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.121\nhow it connects with Davinia\n\n00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:39.586\nand, hopefully, with you.\n\n00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:42.030\nGrowing up in Melbourne, Australia,\n\n00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:45.393\nI was one of those seriously\nirritating little kids\n\n00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:47.741\nthat never, ever stopped asking, \"Why?\"\n\n00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:49.360\nYou might have been one yourself.\n\n00:02:49.384 --> 00:02:52.756\nI used to ask my mum\nthe most annoying questions.\n\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.579\nI'd ask her questions like,\n\"Mum, why I can't I dress up\n\n00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:57.530\nand play with puppets all day?\"\n\n00:02:57.554 --> 00:02:59.554\n\"Why do you want fries with that?\"\n\n00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:01.084\n\"What is a shrimp,\n\n00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:03.780\nand why do we have to keep\nthrowing them on the barbie?\"\n\n00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:04.805\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.637\n\"And mum -- this haircut.\n\n00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:07.834\nWhy?\"\n\n00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:09.286\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:10.084 --> 00:03:11.838\nThe worst haircut, I think.\n\n00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:14.473\nStill terrible.\n\n00:03:14.497 --> 00:03:17.299\nAs a \"why\" kid, I thought\nI could change the world,\n\n00:03:17.323 --> 00:03:19.923\nand it was impossible\nto convince me otherwise.\n\n00:03:19.947 --> 00:03:22.534\nAnd when I was 12\nand in my first year of high school,\n\n00:03:22.558 --> 00:03:25.795\nI started raising money\nfor communities in the developing world.\n\n00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.014\nWe were a really\nenthusiastic group of kids,\n\n00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:31.299\nand we raised more money\nthan any other school in Australia.\n\n00:03:31.323 --> 00:03:34.911\nAnd so I was awarded the chance\nto go to the Philippines to learn more.\n\n00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:36.849\nIt was 1998.\n\n00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:40.560\nWe were taken into a slum\nin the outskirts of Manila.\n\n00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:44.314\nIt was there I became friends\nwith Sonny Boy,\n\n00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:47.877\nwho lived on what was literally\na pile of steaming garbage.\n\n00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:50.584\n\"Smoky Mountain\" was what they called it.\n\n00:03:50.608 --> 00:03:52.893\nBut don't let the romance\nof that name fool you,\n\n00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:55.278\nbecause it was nothing more\nthan a rancid landfill\n\n00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:59.643\nthat kids like Sonny Boy spent hours\nrummaging through every single day\n\n00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.603\nto find something, anything of value.\n\n00:04:03.262 --> 00:04:06.538\nThat night with Sonny Boy and his family\nchanged my life forever,\n\n00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:08.585\nbecause when it came time to go to sleep,\n\n00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.356\nwe simply laid down on this concrete\nslab the size of half my bedroom\n\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.286\nwith myself, Sonny Boy,\nand the rest of his family,\n\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.921\nseven of us in this long line,\n\n00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:19.339\nwith the smell of rubbish all around us\n\n00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:21.497\nand cockroaches crawling all around.\n\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.189\nAnd I didn't sleep a wink,\n\n00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:24.922\nbut I lay awake thinking to myself,\n\n00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:27.428\n\"Why should anyone have to live like this\n\n00:04:27.452 --> 00:04:28.804\nwhen I have so much?\n\n00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.994\nWhy should Sonny Boy's ability\nto live out his dreams\n\n00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:34.064\nbe determined by where he's born,\n\n00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:36.849\nor what Warren Buffett called\n'the ovarian lottery?'\"\n\n00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:38.912\nI just didn't get it,\n\n00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:40.802\nand I needed to understand why.\n\n00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.960\nNow, I only later came to understand\n\n00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.412\nthat the poverty I'd seen\nin the Philippines\n\n00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:50.745\nwas the result of decisions made\nor not made, man-made,\n\n00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:54.174\nby a succession of colonial powers\nand corrupt governments\n\n00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:57.363\nwho had anything but the interests\nof Sonny Boy at heart.\n\n00:04:57.387 --> 00:05:01.187\nSure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain,\nbut they may as well have.\n\n00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:03.812\nAnd if we're to try to help\nkids like Sonny Boy,\n\n00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:06.528\nit wouldn't work just to try\nto send him a few dollars\n\n00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:09.640\nor to try to clean up\nthe garbage dump on which he lived,\n\n00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:12.148\nbecause the core\nof the problem lay elsewhere.\n\n00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:15.831\nAnd as I worked on community\ndevelopment projects over the coming years\n\n00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:17.697\ntrying to help build schools,\n\n00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:20.762\ntrain teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,\n\n00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:23.223\nI came to see that community development\n\n00:05:23.247 --> 00:05:25.803\nshould be driven\nby communities themselves,\n\n00:05:25.827 --> 00:05:29.580\nand that although charity is necessary,\nit's not sufficient.\n\n00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:31.465\nWe need to confront these challenges\n\n00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:34.155\non a global scale and in a systemic way.\n\n00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:35.624\nAnd the best thing I could do\n\n00:05:35.648 --> 00:05:39.155\nis try to mobilize a large group\nof citizens back home\n\n00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:42.742\nto insist that our leaders engage\nin that systemic change.\n\n00:05:43.273 --> 00:05:45.273\nThat's why, a few years later,\n\n00:05:45.297 --> 00:05:47.566\nI joined with a group of college friends\n\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.968\nin bringing the Make Poverty History\ncampaign to Australia.\n\n00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:54.783\nWe had this dream of staging\nthis small concert\n\n00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:58.680\naround the time of the G20\nwith local Aussie artists,\n\n00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:00.356\nand it suddenly exploded one day\n\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.982\nwhen we got a phone call from Bono,\nthe Edge and Pearl Jam,\n\n00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:07.275\nwho all agreed to headline our concert.\n\n00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.900\nI got a little bit excited\nthat day, as you can see.\n\n00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:11.862\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:11.886 --> 00:06:13.165\nBut to our amazement,\n\n00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.281\nthe Australian government\nheard our collective voices,\n\n00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:19.999\nand they agreed to double investment\ninto global health and development --\n\n00:06:20.023 --> 00:06:22.738\nan additional 6.2 billion dollars.\n\n00:06:23.238 --> 00:06:24.413\nIt felt like --\n\n00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:28.896\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.513\nIt felt like this incredible validation.\n\n00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:34.903\nBy rallying citizens together,\nwe helped persuade our government\n\n00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.413\nto do the unthinkable,\n\n00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:40.082\nand act to fix a problem\nmiles outside of our borders.\n\n00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:42.225\nBut here's the thing:\n\n00:06:43.114 --> 00:06:44.415\nit didn't last.\n\n00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:46.853\nSee, there was a change in government,\n\n00:06:46.877 --> 00:06:49.565\nand six years later, all that new money\n\n00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:50.755\ndisappeared.\n\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.732\nWhat did we learn?\n\n00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.738\nWe learned that one-off spikes\nare not enough.\n\n00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.643\nWe needed a sustainable movement,\n\n00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:03.651\nnot one that is susceptible\nto the fluctuating moods of a politician\n\n00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:05.952\nor the hint of an economic downturn.\n\n00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:08.078\nAnd it needed to happen everywhere;\n\n00:07:08.102 --> 00:07:12.007\notherwise, every individual government\nwould have this built-in excuse mechanism\n\n00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:16.140\nthat they couldn't possibly carry\nthe burden of global action alone.\n\n00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:19.458\nAnd so this is what we embarked upon.\n\n00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.038\nAnd as we embarked upon\nthis challenge, we asked ourselves,\n\n00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:26.559\nhow do we gain enough pressure\nand build a broad enough army\n\n00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.671\nto win these fights for the long term?\n\n00:07:29.377 --> 00:07:31.344\nWe could only think of one way.\n\n00:07:31.992 --> 00:07:34.703\nWe needed to somehow turn\nthat short-term excitement\n\n00:07:34.727 --> 00:07:37.624\nof people involved with\nthe Make Poverty History campaign\n\n00:07:37.648 --> 00:07:39.250\ninto long-term passion.\n\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.777\nIt had to be part of their identity.\n\n00:07:42.277 --> 00:07:47.199\nSo in 2012, we cofounded an organization\nthat had exactly that as its goal.\n\n00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:49.683\nAnd there was only one name for it:\n\n00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:51.516\nGlobal Citizen.\n\n00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.706\nBut this is not about\nany one organization.\n\n00:07:55.253 --> 00:07:57.576\nThis is about citizens taking action.\n\n00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:59.760\nAnd research data tells us\n\n00:07:59.784 --> 00:08:04.015\nthat of the total population\nwho even care about global issues,\n\n00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:07.544\nonly 18 percent have done\nanything about it.\n\n00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:10.529\nIt's not that people don't want to act.\n\n00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:12.984\nIt's often that they don't\nknow how to take action,\n\n00:08:13.008 --> 00:08:16.109\nor that they believe that their actions\nwill have no effect.\n\n00:08:16.133 --> 00:08:19.658\nSo we had to somehow recruit\nand activate millions of citizens\n\n00:08:19.682 --> 00:08:21.343\nin dozens of countries\n\n00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:24.666\nto put pressure on their leaders\nto behave altruistically.\n\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.711\nAnd as we did so, we discovered\nsomething really thrilling,\n\n00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:31.171\nthat when you make\nglobal citizenship your mission,\n\n00:08:31.195 --> 00:08:34.677\nyou suddenly find yourself\nwith some extraordinary allies.\n\n00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:38.566\nSee, extreme poverty isn't the only issue\nthat's fundamentally global.\n\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.454\nSo, too, is climate change,\n\n00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.054\nhuman rights, gender equality,\n\n00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:44.664\neven conflict.\n\n00:08:44.688 --> 00:08:47.280\nWe found ourselves shoulder to shoulder\n\n00:08:47.304 --> 00:08:50.949\nwith people who are passionate about\ntargeting all these interrelated issues.\n\n00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:53.311\nBut how did we actually\ngo about recruiting\n\n00:08:53.335 --> 00:08:55.261\nand engaging those global citizens?\n\n00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.556\nWell, we used the universal language:\n\n00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:00.221\nmusic.\n\n00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:02.508\nWe launched the Global Citizen Festival\n\n00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:05.382\nin the heart of New York City\nin Central Park,\n\n00:09:05.406 --> 00:09:09.174\nand we persuaded some of the world's\nbiggest artists to participate.\n\n00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.514\nWe made sure that\nthese festivals coincided\n\n00:09:11.538 --> 00:09:13.679\nwith the UN General Assembly meeting,\n\n00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:16.157\nso that leaders who need\nto hear our voices\n\n00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.910\ncouldn't possible ignore them.\n\n00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:20.127\nBut there was a twist:\n\n00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:22.497\nyou couldn't buy a ticket.\n\n00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:23.711\nYou had to earn it.\n\n00:09:24.178 --> 00:09:27.155\nYou had to take action\non behalf of a global cause,\n\n00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:30.771\nand only once you'd done that\ncould you earn enough points to qualify.\n\n00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:33.421\nActivism is the currency.\n\n00:09:34.037 --> 00:09:38.437\nI had no interest in citizenship\npurely as some sort of feel-good thing.\n\n00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:42.738\nFor me, citizenship means you have to act,\nand that's what we required.\n\n00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:44.723\nAnd amazingly, it worked.\n\n00:09:44.747 --> 00:09:49.454\nLast year, more than 155,000 citizens\nin the New York area alone\n\n00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:51.381\nearned enough points to qualify.\n\n00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:55.769\nGlobally, we've now signed up citizens\nin over 150 countries around the world.\n\n00:09:55.793 --> 00:09:59.205\nAnd last year, we signed up\nmore than 100,000 new members\n\n00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:01.182\neach and every week of the whole year.\n\n00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:05.769\nSee, we don't need to create\nglobal citizens from nothing.\n\n00:10:05.793 --> 00:10:07.722\nWe're already everywhere.\n\n00:10:07.746 --> 00:10:09.925\nWe just need to be organized\n\n00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:11.597\nand motivated to start acting.\n\n00:10:12.187 --> 00:10:15.282\nAnd this is where I believe\nwe can learn a lot from Davinia,\n\n00:10:15.306 --> 00:10:19.256\nwho started taking action\nas a global citizen back in 2012.\n\n00:10:19.883 --> 00:10:21.105\nHere's what she did.\n\n00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:23.089\nIt wasn't rocket science.\n\n00:10:23.495 --> 00:10:25.771\nShe started writing letters,\n\n00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:28.081\nemailing politicians' offices.\n\n00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:31.100\nShe volunteered her time\nin her local community.\n\n00:10:31.124 --> 00:10:33.736\nThat's when she got active on social media\n\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.990\nand started to collect pennies --\n\n00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:37.315\na lot of pennies.\n\n00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:41.500\nNow, maybe that doesn't sound\nlike a lot to you.\n\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.706\nHow will that achieve anything?\n\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.575\nWell, it achieved a lot\nbecause she wasn't alone.\n\n00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:52.608\nHer actions, alongside 142,000\nother global citizens',\n\n00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:55.273\nled the US government\nto double their investment\n\n00:10:55.297 --> 00:10:57.128\ninto Global Partnership for Education.\n\n00:10:57.152 --> 00:10:58.691\nAnd here's Dr. Raj Shah,\n\n00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:01.217\nthe head of USAID,\nmaking that announcement.\n\n00:11:01.241 --> 00:11:05.080\nSee, when thousands of global citizens\nfind inspiration from each other,\n\n00:11:05.104 --> 00:11:07.783\nit's amazing to see\ntheir collective power.\n\n00:11:07.807 --> 00:11:11.219\nGlobal citizens like Davinia\nhelped persuade the World Bank\n\n00:11:11.243 --> 00:11:13.918\nto boost their investment\ninto water and sanitation.\n\n00:11:13.942 --> 00:11:17.982\nHere's the Bank's president Jim Kim\nannouncing 15 billion dollars onstage\n\n00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:19.268\nat Global Citizen,\n\n00:11:19.292 --> 00:11:22.798\nand Prime Minister Modi of India\naffirmed his commitment\n\n00:11:22.822 --> 00:11:27.706\nto put a toilet in every household\nand school across India by 2019.\n\n00:11:28.452 --> 00:11:32.668\nGlobal citizens encouraged\nby the late-night host Stephen Colbert\n\n00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.644\nlaunched a Twitter invasion on Norway.\n\n00:11:35.668 --> 00:11:38.875\nErna Solberg, the country's\nPrime Minister, got the message,\n\n00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:41.907\ncommitting to double investment\ninto girls' education.\n\n00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:46.193\nGlobal citizens together with Rotarians\ncalled on the Canadian, UK,\n\n00:11:46.217 --> 00:11:47.618\nand Australian governments\n\n00:11:47.642 --> 00:11:50.504\nto boost their investment\ninto polio eradication.\n\n00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:54.637\nThey got together and committed\n665 million dollars.\n\n00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:58.315\nBut despite all of this momentum,\n\n00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:01.235\nwe face some huge challenges.\n\n00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:03.846\nSee, you might be thinking to yourself,\n\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.194\nhow can we possibly persuade world leaders\n\n00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:08.575\nto sustain a focus on global issues?\n\n00:12:09.432 --> 00:12:14.515\nIndeed, the powerful American\npolitician Tip O'Neill once said,\n\n00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:16.538\n\"All politics is local.\"\n\n00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.493\nThat's what always\ngot politicians elected:\n\n00:12:20.517 --> 00:12:23.539\nto seek, gain and hold onto power\n\n00:12:23.563 --> 00:12:27.436\nthrough the pursuit of local\nor at very best national interests.\n\n00:12:28.143 --> 00:12:32.455\nI experienced this for the first time\nwhen I was 21 years old.\n\n00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:34.453\nI took a meeting\n\n00:12:34.477 --> 00:12:38.916\nwith a then-Australian Foreign Minister\nwho shall remain nameless --\n\n00:12:39.613 --> 00:12:40.904\n[Alexander Downer]\n\n00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:42.686\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:43.473 --> 00:12:44.695\nAnd behind closed doors,\n\n00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:47.195\nI shared with him my passion\nto end extreme poverty.\n\n00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:51.138\nI said, \"Minister -- Australia\nhas this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\n\n00:12:51.162 --> 00:12:53.851\nto help achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\n\n00:12:53.875 --> 00:12:55.121\nWe can do this.\"\n\n00:12:55.764 --> 00:12:57.202\nAnd he paused,\n\n00:12:57.226 --> 00:12:59.748\nlooked down on me\nwith cold, dismissive eyes,\n\n00:13:00.423 --> 00:13:01.891\nand he said, \"Hugh,\n\n00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:04.105\nno one gives a funk about foreign aid.\"\n\n00:13:04.573 --> 00:13:06.383\nExcept he didn't use the word \"funk.\"\n\n00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:08.647\nHe went on.\n\n00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:11.228\nHe said we need to look after\nour own backyard first.\n\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.993\nThis is, I believe,\n\n00:13:13.017 --> 00:13:15.484\noutdated, even dangerous thinking.\n\n00:13:16.017 --> 00:13:17.890\nOr as my late grandfather would say,\n\n00:13:17.914 --> 00:13:19.259\ncomplete BS.\n\n00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:22.905\nParochialism offers this false dichotomy\n\n00:13:22.929 --> 00:13:26.435\nbecause it pits the poor in one country\nagainst the poor in another.\n\n00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:30.308\nIt pretends we can isolate ourselves\nand our nations from one another.\n\n00:13:30.657 --> 00:13:32.724\nThe whole world is our backyard,\n\n00:13:32.748 --> 00:13:34.629\nand we ignore it at our peril.\n\n00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:36.851\nSee, look what happened\nwhen we ignored Rwanda,\n\n00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.343\nwhen we ignore Syria,\n\n00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:40.270\nwhen we ignore climate change.\n\n00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:42.477\nPolitical leaders ought to give a \"funk\"\n\n00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:45.164\nbecause the impact of climate change\nand extreme poverty\n\n00:13:45.188 --> 00:13:46.544\ncomes right to our shore.\n\n00:13:47.068 --> 00:13:49.678\nNow, global citizens --\nthey understand this.\n\n00:13:49.702 --> 00:13:52.952\nWe live in a time that favors\nthe global citizen,\n\n00:13:52.976 --> 00:13:55.888\nin an age where every\nsingle voice can be heard.\n\n00:13:55.912 --> 00:13:57.080\nSee, do you remember\n\n00:13:57.104 --> 00:14:00.570\nwhen the Millennium Development Goals\nwere signed back in the year 2000?\n\n00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:03.499\nThe most we could do in those days\nwas fire off a letter\n\n00:14:03.523 --> 00:14:05.234\nand wait for the next election.\n\n00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:07.369\nThere was no social media.\n\n00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:11.171\nToday, billions of citizens\nhave more tools,\n\n00:14:11.195 --> 00:14:13.013\nmore access to information,\n\n00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:15.488\nmore capacity to influence\nthan ever before.\n\n00:14:16.109 --> 00:14:19.851\nBoth the problems and the tools\nto solve them are right before us.\n\n00:14:20.335 --> 00:14:22.401\nThe world has changed,\n\n00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:24.822\nand those of us who look\nbeyond our borders\n\n00:14:24.846 --> 00:14:26.886\nare on the right side of history.\n\n00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:29.267\nSo where are we?\n\n00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:32.223\nSo we run this amazing festival,\n\n00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.562\nwe've scored some big policy wins,\n\n00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:37.085\nand citizens are signing up\nall over the world.\n\n00:14:37.775 --> 00:14:39.831\nBut have we achieved our mission?\n\n00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:41.767\nNo.\n\n00:14:42.243 --> 00:14:43.888\nWe have such a long way to go.\n\n00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:47.086\nBut this is the opportunity that I see.\n\n00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:50.499\nThe concept of global citizenship,\n\n00:14:51.674 --> 00:14:57.370\nself-evident in its logic but until now\nimpractical in many ways,\n\n00:14:57.394 --> 00:15:01.524\nhas coincided with this particular moment\nin which we are privileged to live.\n\n00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.154\nWe, as global citizens,\n\n00:15:03.178 --> 00:15:07.765\nnow have a unique opportunity\nto accelerate large-scale positive change\n\n00:15:07.789 --> 00:15:09.026\naround the world.\n\n00:15:09.512 --> 00:15:11.671\nSo in the months and years ahead,\n\n00:15:11.695 --> 00:15:14.739\nglobal citizens will hold\nworld leaders accountable\n\n00:15:14.763 --> 00:15:17.809\nto ensure that the new Global Goals\nfor Sustainable Development\n\n00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.498\nare tracked and implemented.\n\n00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.884\nGlobal citizens will partner\nwith the world's leading NGOs\n\n00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:25.740\nto end diseases like polio and malaria.\n\n00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:29.368\nGlobal citizens will sign up\nin every corner of this globe,\n\n00:15:29.392 --> 00:15:32.048\nincreasing the frequency, quality\n\n00:15:32.072 --> 00:15:33.817\nand impact of their actions.\n\n00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.896\nThese dreams are within reach.\n\n00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:40.001\nImagine an army of millions\n\n00:15:40.025 --> 00:15:42.222\ngrowing into tens of millions,\n\n00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:45.993\nconnected, informed, engaged\n\n00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:48.778\nand unwilling to take no for an answer.\n\n00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.950\nOver all these years,\n\n00:15:53.188 --> 00:15:55.363\nI've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.\n\n00:15:56.728 --> 00:15:58.561\nSadly, I've been unable to.\n\n00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:02.762\nWe met long before social media,\n\n00:16:03.437 --> 00:16:06.201\nand his address has now\nbeen relocated by the authorities,\n\n00:16:06.225 --> 00:16:08.088\nas often happens with slums.\n\n00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:11.315\nI'd love to sit down with him,\n\n00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:12.532\nwherever he is,\n\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.348\nand share with him how much the time\nI spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.\n\n00:16:18.638 --> 00:16:20.387\nThanks to him and so many others,\n\n00:16:20.411 --> 00:16:24.082\nI came to understand the importance\nof being part of a movement of people --\n\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.177\nthe kids willing to look up\nfrom their screens and out to the world,\n\n00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:30.169\nthe global citizens.\n\n00:16:31.062 --> 00:16:33.185\nGlobal citizens who stand together,\n\n00:16:33.931 --> 00:16:35.733\nwho ask the question \"Why?,\"\n\n00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.373\nwho reject the naysayers,\n\n00:16:38.896 --> 00:16:42.119\nand embrace the amazing possibilities\nof the world we share.\n\n00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:44.563\nI'm a global citizen.\n\n00:16:45.148 --> 00:16:46.301\nAre you?\n\n00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:47.981\nThank you.\n\n00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:55.571\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Your kids might live on Mars. Here's how they'll survive", "duration": "1034", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_petranek_your_kids_might_live_on_mars_here_s_how_they_ll_survive", "transcript": "Strap yourselves in, we're going to Mars.Not just a few astronauts \u2014 thousands of people are going to colonize Mars. And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon. Some of you will end up working on projects on Mars, and I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there.That probably sounds preposterous, so I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen. But first I want to discuss the obvious question: Why the heck should we do this?12 years ago, I gave a TED talk on 10 ways the world could end suddenly. We are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy. A single, large asteroid could take us out forever. To survive we have to reach beyond the home planet. Think what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated.And there's another reason we should go: exploration is in our DNA. Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons. This stuff is inside us. And they prospered doing that. Some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology came because we explored.Yes, we could do a lot of good with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars. And yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet. And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth.But think for a moment, what we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon. He excited an entire generation to dream. Think how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars. Perhaps then we will look back at Earth and see that that is one people instead of many and perhaps then we will look back at Earth, as we struggle to survive on Mars, and realize how precious the home planet is.So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake. But first, a few fascinating facts about where we're going. This picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth. Mars is not our sister planet. It's far less than half the size of the Earth, and yet despite the fact that it's smaller, the surface area of Mars that you can stand on is equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on, because the Earth is mostly covered by water.The atmosphere on Mars is really thin \u2014 100 times thinner than on Earth \u2014 and it's not breathable, it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.It's really cold there. The average temperature is minus 81 degrees, although there is quite a range of temperature.A day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth, plus about 39 minutes. Seasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth.And for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day, Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth, and it's the kind of place where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it.Now, as you can see, Mars isn't exactly Earth-like, but it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system.Here's the problem. Mars is a long way away, a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon. The Moon is 250,000 miles away and it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there. Mars is 250 million miles away and it will take us eight months to get there \u2014 240 days. And that's only if we launch on a very specific day, at a very specific time, once every two years, when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so, so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest. 240 days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.And meanwhile, our track record of getting to Mars is lousy. We and the Russians, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Indians, have actually sent 44 rockets there, and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed. Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful.And we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway. We once had that rocket, the Saturn V. A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there. It was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans, and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon. But the last Saturn V was used in 1973 to launch the Skylab space station, and we decided to do something called the shuttle instead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon. The biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough to get us anything to Mars.So getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ... how soon will the first humans actually land here?Now, some pundits think if we got there by 2050, that'd be a pretty good achievement.These days, NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by 2040. Maybe they can. I believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by 2035. But frankly, I don't think they're going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars, because we will already be there.We're going to land on Mars in 2027. And the reason is this man is determined to make that happen. His name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Now, he actually told me that we would land on Mars by 2025, but Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am \u2014 and that's going a ways \u2014 so I'm giving him a couple of years of slack. Still ... you've got to ask yourself, can this guy really do this by 2025 or 2027?Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective. Where was this 10 years ago? That's the Tesla electric automobile. In 2005, a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying, we would not have a decent electric car for 50 years.And where was that? That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, lifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station. 10 years ago, SpaceX had not launched anything, or fired a rocket to anywhere. So I think it's a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry in less than 10 years and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than 10 years will get us to Mars by 2027.Now, you need to know this: governments and robots no longer control this game. Private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy to take you to Mars.And that raises a really big question. Can we actually live there? Now, NASA may not be able to get us there until 2040, or we may get there a long time before NASA, but NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars.Let's look at the problem this way. Here's what you need to live on Earth: food, water, shelter and clothing. And here's what you need to live on Mars: all of the above, plus oxygen.So let's look at the most important thing on this list first. Water is the basis of all life as we know it, and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live, so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars. And if you look at Mars, it looks really dry, it looks like the entire planet is a desert. But it turns out that it's not. The soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water. And a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us \u2014 and by the way, that's a real photograph \u2014 that lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them. It's not a bad place to start a colony.Now, here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in 2008, showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice \u2014 that white stuff is ice. In the second picture, which is four days later than the first picture, you can see that some of it is evaporating.Orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars as well as glaciers. In fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted, most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water. So there's plenty of water there, but most of it's ice, most of it's underground, it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor.This is a device cooked up at the University of Washington back in 1998. It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier. And it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often 100 percent humid. So this device can extract all the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on Mars.Next we have to worry about what we will breathe. Frankly, I was really shocked to find out that NASA has this problem worked out. This is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht. And he's developed this machine, Moxie. I love this thing. It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially, that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen. And you have to remember that CO2 \u2014 carbon dioxide, which is 96 percent of Mars' atmosphere \u2014 CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.Now, the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020 is going to have one of these devices aboard, and it will be able to produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive indefinitely. But the secret to this \u2014 and that's just for testing \u2014 the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get-go to be scalable by a factor of 100.Next, what will we eat? Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food, but we're not going to be able to grow more than 15 to 20 percent of our food there, at least not until water is running on the surface of Mars and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops. In the meantime, most of our food will arrive from Earth, and it will be dried.And then we need some shelter. At first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings as well as the landers themselves. But this really only works during the daytime. There is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays. So we really have to go underground.Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars, by and large, is perfect for making bricks. And NASA has figured this one out, too. They're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks, shove them in a microwave oven, and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls. Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes, of which there are plenty.And finally there's clothing. On Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us, which creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times, and we're constantly pushing out against that. On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure. So Dava Newman, a scientist at MIT, has created this sleek space suit. It will keep us together, block radiation and keep us warm.So let's think about this for a minute. Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ... we can do this. We really can. But it's still a little complicated and a little difficult.So that leads to the next big \u2014 really big step \u2014 in living the good life on Mars. And that's terraforming the planet: making it more like Earth, reengineering an entire planet.That sounds like a lot of hubris, but the truth is that the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists.First we've got to warm it up. Mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere. The answer lies here, at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars, both of which are covered with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide \u2014 dry ice. If we heat it up, it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth.And as we know, CO2 is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas. Now, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail and focus it \u2014 it essentially serves as a mirror \u2014 and focus it on the south pole of Mars at first. As the planet spins, it will heat up all that dry ice, sublime it, and it will go into the atmosphere. It actually won't take long for the temperature on Mars to start rising, probably less than 20 years.Right now, on a perfect day at the equator, in the middle of summer on Mars, temperatures can actually reach 70 degrees, but then they go down to minus 100 at night.(Laughter)What we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect: enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars \u2014 especially the ice in the ground \u2014 melt. Then we get some real magic.As the atmosphere gets thicker, everything gets better. We get more protection from radiation, more atmosphere makes us warmer, makes the planet warmer, so we get running water and that makes crops possible. Then more water vapor goes into the air, forming yet another potent greenhouse gas. It will rain and it will snow on Mars. And a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure so that we can throw away those space suits. We only need about five pounds of pressure to survive. Eventually, Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia.We'll still be left with the complicated problem of making the atmosphere breathable, and frankly that could take 1,000 years to accomplish. But humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable.There is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish and no telling what we can do with our own bodies. In biology right now, we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics, what the genes in our own bodies are doing, and certainly, eventually, our own evolution. We could end up with a species of human being on Earth that is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars.But what would you do there? How would you live? It's going to be the same as it is on Earth. Somebody's going to start a restaurant, somebody's going to build an iron foundry. Someone will make documentary movies of Mars and sell them on Earth. Some idiot will start a reality TV show.(Laughter)There will be software companies, there will be hotels, there will be bars.This much is certain: it will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes, and I think it will be the most inspiring.Ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to Mars. Children who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there.Remember when we landed humans on the Moon? When that happened, people looked at each other and said, \"If we can do this, we can do anything.\" What are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars?Most importantly, it will make us a spacefaring species. And that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth. We will never be the last of our kind.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2476, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:15.334\nStrap yourselves in,\n\n00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:17.334\nwe're going to Mars.\n\n00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:19.454\nNot just a few astronauts --\n\n00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:22.614\nthousands of people\nare going to colonize Mars.\n\n00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.758\nAnd I am telling you\nthat they're going to do this soon.\n\n00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.494\nSome of you will end up\nworking on projects on Mars,\n\n00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:32.878\nand I guarantee that some\nof your children will end up living there.\n\n00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:36.094\nThat probably sounds preposterous,\n\n00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:38.998\nso I'm going to share with you\nhow and when that will happen.\n\n00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:42.934\nBut first I want to discuss\nthe obvious question:\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.437\nWhy the heck should we do this?\n\n00:00:45.598 --> 00:00:46.814\n12 years ago,\n\n00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:50.654\nI gave a TED talk on 10 ways\nthe world could end suddenly.\n\n00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:55.454\nWe are incredibly vulnerable\nto the whims of our own galaxy.\n\n00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:59.054\nA single, large asteroid\ncould take us out forever.\n\n00:00:59.078 --> 00:01:02.534\nTo survive we have to reach\nbeyond the home planet.\n\n00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:04.774\nThink what a tragedy it would be\n\n00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:07.798\nif all that humans have accomplished\nwere suddenly obliterated.\n\n00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:10.694\nAnd there's another reason we should go:\n\n00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.654\nexploration is in our DNA.\n\n00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:17.134\nTwo million years ago\nhumans evolved in Africa\n\n00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:21.974\nand then slowly but surely\nspread out across the entire planet\n\n00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.494\nby reaching into the wilderness\nthat was beyond their horizons.\n\n00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.118\nThis stuff is inside us.\n\n00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:29.478\nAnd they prospered doing that.\n\n00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:34.094\nSome of the greatest advances\nin civilization and technology\n\n00:01:34.118 --> 00:01:36.038\ncame because we explored.\n\n00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:38.494\nYes, we could do a lot of good\n\n00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:42.238\nwith the money it will take\nto establish a thriving colony on Mars.\n\n00:01:42.838 --> 00:01:47.398\nAnd yes we should all be taking\nfar better care of our own home planet.\n\n00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:53.038\nAnd yes, I worry we could screw up Mars\nthe way we've screwed up Earth.\n\n00:01:54.278 --> 00:01:55.894\nBut think for a moment,\n\n00:01:55.918 --> 00:02:00.854\nwhat we had when John F. Kennedy\ntold us we would put a human on the moon.\n\n00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:04.278\nHe excited an entire generation to dream.\n\n00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.294\nThink how inspired we will be\nto see a landing on Mars.\n\n00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:11.054\nPerhaps then we will look back at Earth\n\n00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:14.454\nand see that that is\none people instead of many\n\n00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:17.014\nand perhaps then\nwe will look back at Earth,\n\n00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:19.454\nas we struggle to survive on Mars,\n\n00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:22.198\nand realize how precious\nthe home planet is.\n\n00:02:23.478 --> 00:02:28.398\nSo let me tell you about the extraordinary\nadventure we're about to undertake.\n\n00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:30.254\nBut first,\n\n00:02:30.278 --> 00:02:32.878\na few fascinating facts\nabout where we're going.\n\n00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:38.374\nThis picture actually represents\nthe true size of Mars compared to Earth.\n\n00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:40.294\nMars is not our sister planet.\n\n00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:43.094\nIt's far less than half\nthe size of the Earth,\n\n00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:45.134\nand yet despite the fact\nthat it's smaller,\n\n00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:47.854\nthe surface area of Mars\nthat you can stand on\n\n00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:51.814\nis equivalent to the surface area\nof the Earth that you can stand on,\n\n00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.158\nbecause the Earth\nis mostly covered by water.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.254\nThe atmosphere on Mars is really thin --\n\n00:02:57.278 --> 00:02:59.854\n100 times thinner than on Earth --\n\n00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:03.878\nand it's not breathable,\nit's 96 percent carbon dioxide.\n\n00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.334\nIt's really cold there.\n\n00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:09.334\nThe average temperature\nis minus 81 degrees,\n\n00:03:09.358 --> 00:03:12.518\nalthough there is\nquite a range of temperature.\n\n00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:15.854\nA day on Mars is about as long\nas a day on Earth,\n\n00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:17.798\nplus about 39 minutes.\n\n00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:23.438\nSeasons and years on Mars\nare twice as long as they are on Earth.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:28.614\nAnd for anybody who wants to strap\non some wings and go flying one day,\n\n00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:31.454\nMars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,\n\n00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:32.734\nand it's the kind of place\n\n00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:35.558\nwhere you can jump over your car\ninstead of walk around it.\n\n00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:39.734\nNow, as you can see,\nMars isn't exactly Earth-like,\n\n00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:44.518\nbut it's by far the most livable\nother place in our entire solar system.\n\n00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:46.814\nHere's the problem.\n\n00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:49.014\nMars is a long way away,\n\n00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:53.878\na thousand times farther away\nfrom us than our own moon.\n\n00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:58.294\nThe Moon is 250,000 miles away\n\n00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:01.958\nand it took Apollo astronauts\nthree days to get there.\n\n00:04:02.678 --> 00:04:05.814\nMars is 250 million miles away\n\n00:04:05.838 --> 00:04:08.094\nand it will take us\neight months to get there --\n\n00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:09.398\n240 days.\n\n00:04:10.038 --> 00:04:12.614\nAnd that's only if we launch\non a very specific day,\n\n00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:14.374\nat a very specific time,\n\n00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:16.374\nonce every two years,\n\n00:04:16.398 --> 00:04:19.574\nwhen Mars and the Earth\nare aligned just so,\n\n00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:23.518\nso the distance that the rocket\nwould have to travel will be the shortest.\n\n00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:29.678\n240 days is a long time to spend\ntrapped with your colleagues in a tin can.\n\n00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:34.814\nAnd meanwhile, our track record\nof getting to Mars is lousy.\n\n00:04:34.838 --> 00:04:37.654\nWe and the Russians,\nthe Europeans, the Japanese,\n\n00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:39.014\nthe Chinese and the Indians,\n\n00:04:39.038 --> 00:04:41.614\nhave actually sent 44 rockets there,\n\n00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:45.174\nand the vast majority of them\nhave either missed or crashed.\n\n00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:48.798\nOnly about a third of the missions\nto Mars have been successful.\n\n00:04:49.718 --> 00:04:54.078\nAnd we don't at the moment have\na rocket big enough to get there anyway.\n\n00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:57.134\nWe once had that rocket, the Saturn V.\n\n00:04:57.158 --> 00:04:59.774\nA couple of Saturn Vs\nwould have gotten us there.\n\n00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:03.254\nIt was the most magnificent\nmachine ever built by humans,\n\n00:05:03.278 --> 00:05:05.478\nand it was the rocket\nthat took us to the Moon.\n\n00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:11.094\nBut the last Saturn V was used in 1973\nto launch the Skylab space station,\n\n00:05:11.118 --> 00:05:14.214\nand we decided to do\nsomething called the shuttle\n\n00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:17.878\ninstead of continuing on to Mars\nafter we landed on the Moon.\n\n00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:20.094\nThe biggest rocket we have now\n\n00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:23.118\nis only half big enough\nto get us anything to Mars.\n\n00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:27.174\nSo getting to Mars is not going to be easy\n\n00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:30.358\nand that brings up\na really interesting question ...\n\n00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:35.718\nhow soon will the first humans\nactually land here?\n\n00:05:37.118 --> 00:05:41.454\nNow, some pundits think\nif we got there by 2050,\n\n00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:43.198\nthat'd be a pretty good achievement.\n\n00:05:43.798 --> 00:05:49.678\nThese days, NASA seems to be saying\nthat it can get humans to Mars by 2040.\n\n00:05:50.238 --> 00:05:51.438\nMaybe they can.\n\n00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:57.654\nI believe that they can get\nhuman beings into Mars orbit by 2035.\n\n00:05:57.678 --> 00:05:58.934\nBut frankly,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:03.694\nI don't think they're going to bother\nin 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,\n\n00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:05.694\nbecause we will already be there.\n\n00:06:05.718 --> 00:06:08.678\nWe're going to land on Mars in 2027.\n\n00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:11.454\nAnd the reason is\n\n00:06:11.478 --> 00:06:13.534\nthis man is determined\nto make that happen.\n\n00:06:13.558 --> 00:06:19.038\nHis name is Elon Musk,\nhe's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.\n\n00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:24.934\nNow, he actually told me\nthat we would land on Mars by 2025,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.854\nbut Elon Musk is more\noptimistic than I am --\n\n00:06:27.878 --> 00:06:29.374\nand that's going a ways --\n\n00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:32.038\nso I'm giving him\na couple of years of slack.\n\n00:06:32.918 --> 00:06:34.334\nStill ...\n\n00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:35.694\nyou've got to ask yourself,\n\n00:06:35.718 --> 00:06:39.598\ncan this guy really do this\nby 2025 or 2027?\n\n00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:44.398\nWell, let's put a decade with Elon Musk\ninto a little perspective.\n\n00:06:45.158 --> 00:06:46.638\nWhere was this 10 years ago?\n\n00:06:47.318 --> 00:06:49.574\nThat's the Tesla electric automobile.\n\n00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:53.254\nIn 2005, a lot of people\nin the automobile industry were saying,\n\n00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:56.718\nwe would not have\na decent electric car for 50 years.\n\n00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:01.518\nAnd where was that?\n\n00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:05.254\nThat is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,\n\n00:07:05.278 --> 00:07:09.654\nlifting six tons of supplies\nto the International Space Station.\n\n00:07:09.678 --> 00:07:10.894\n10 years ago,\n\n00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:15.478\nSpaceX had not launched anything,\nor fired a rocket to anywhere.\n\n00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:19.094\nSo I think it's a pretty good bet\n\n00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:22.174\nthat the person who is revolutionizing\nthe automobile industry\n\n00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:23.414\nin less than 10 years\n\n00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:29.254\nand the person who created an entire\nrocket company in less than 10 years\n\n00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:31.518\nwill get us to Mars by 2027.\n\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.694\nNow, you need to know this:\n\n00:07:35.718 --> 00:07:39.358\ngovernments and robots\nno longer control this game.\n\n00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:42.374\nPrivate companies are leaping into space\n\n00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:44.838\nand they will be happy\nto take you to Mars.\n\n00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:48.718\nAnd that raises a really big question.\n\n00:07:49.358 --> 00:07:51.358\nCan we actually live there?\n\n00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:56.814\nNow, NASA may not be able\nto get us there until 2040,\n\n00:07:56.838 --> 00:07:58.934\nor we may get there\na long time before NASA,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.918\nbut NASA has taken a huge responsibility\nin figuring out how we can live on Mars.\n\n00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:06.854\nLet's look at the problem this way.\n\n00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:08.734\nHere's what you need to live on Earth:\n\n00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:12.174\nfood, water, shelter and clothing.\n\n00:08:12.198 --> 00:08:14.694\nAnd here's what you need to live on Mars:\n\n00:08:14.718 --> 00:08:16.918\nall of the above, plus oxygen.\n\n00:08:18.118 --> 00:08:22.214\nSo let's look at the most\nimportant thing on this list first.\n\n00:08:22.238 --> 00:08:25.254\nWater is the basis\nof all life as we know it,\n\n00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:29.854\nand it's far too heavy for us to carry\nwater from the Earth to Mars to live,\n\n00:08:29.878 --> 00:08:34.518\nso we have to find water\nif our life is going to succeed on Mars.\n\n00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:38.294\nAnd if you look at Mars,\nit looks really dry,\n\n00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:41.134\nit looks like the entire\nplanet is a desert.\n\n00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:43.174\nBut it turns out that it's not.\n\n00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:48.414\nThe soil alone on Mars\ncontains up to 60 percent water.\n\n00:08:48.438 --> 00:08:53.374\nAnd a number of orbiters that we still\nhave flying around Mars have shown us --\n\n00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:55.934\nand by the way,\nthat's a real photograph --\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:00.094\nthat lots of craters on Mars\nhave a sheet of water ice in them.\n\n00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:02.318\nIt's not a bad place to start a colony.\n\n00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:07.974\nNow, here's a view of a little dig\nthe Phoenix Lander did in 2008,\n\n00:09:07.998 --> 00:09:11.534\nshowing that just below\nthe surface of the soil is ice --\n\n00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:13.814\nthat white stuff is ice.\n\n00:09:13.838 --> 00:09:15.094\nIn the second picture,\n\n00:09:15.118 --> 00:09:17.374\nwhich is four days later\nthan the first picture,\n\n00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:19.438\nyou can see that\nsome of it is evaporating.\n\n00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:21.374\nOrbiters also tell us\n\n00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:24.814\nthat there are huge amounts\nof underground water on Mars\n\n00:09:24.838 --> 00:09:26.894\nas well as glaciers.\n\n00:09:26.918 --> 00:09:31.174\nIn fact, if only the water ice\nat the poles on Mars melted,\n\n00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:33.958\nmost of the planet\nwould be under 30 feet of water.\n\n00:09:34.918 --> 00:09:37.014\nSo there's plenty of water there,\n\n00:09:37.038 --> 00:09:39.574\nbut most of it's ice,\nmost of it's underground,\n\n00:09:39.598 --> 00:09:42.958\nit takes a lot of energy to get it\nand a lot of human labor.\n\n00:09:43.998 --> 00:09:46.734\nThis is a device cooked up\nat the University of Washington\n\n00:09:46.758 --> 00:09:48.238\nback in 1998.\n\n00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:51.854\nIt's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.\n\n00:09:51.878 --> 00:09:55.934\nAnd it turns out the Mars atmosphere\nis often 100 percent humid.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.334\nSo this device can extract\nall the water that humans will need\n\n00:10:00.358 --> 00:10:02.758\nsimply from the atmosphere on Mars.\n\n00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:07.094\nNext we have to worry\nabout what we will breathe.\n\n00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:09.014\nFrankly, I was really shocked\n\n00:10:09.038 --> 00:10:11.598\nto find out that NASA\nhas this problem worked out.\n\n00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:15.198\nThis is a scientist at MIT\nnamed Michael Hecht.\n\n00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:18.574\nAnd he's developed this machine, Moxie.\n\n00:10:18.598 --> 00:10:19.814\nI love this thing.\n\n00:10:19.838 --> 00:10:22.414\nIt's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,\n\n00:10:22.438 --> 00:10:25.598\nthat sucks in the Martian atmosphere\nand pumps out oxygen.\n\n00:10:26.238 --> 00:10:28.214\nAnd you have to remember that CO2 --\n\n00:10:28.238 --> 00:10:32.094\ncarbon dioxide, which is\n96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --\n\n00:10:32.118 --> 00:10:34.918\nCO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.\n\n00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:40.214\nNow, the next big rover\nthat NASA sends to Mars in 2020\n\n00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:42.454\nis going to have one\nof these devices aboard,\n\n00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:45.174\nand it will be able\nto produce enough oxygen\n\n00:10:45.198 --> 00:10:47.894\nto keep one person alive indefinitely.\n\n00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:50.054\nBut the secret to this --\n\n00:10:50.078 --> 00:10:51.774\nand that's just for testing --\n\n00:10:51.798 --> 00:10:55.094\nthe secret to this is that this thing\nwas designed from the get-go\n\n00:10:55.118 --> 00:10:57.758\nto be scalable by a factor of 100.\n\n00:10:58.798 --> 00:11:01.014\nNext, what will we eat?\n\n00:11:01.038 --> 00:11:03.974\nWell, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,\n\n00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:05.854\nbut we're not going to be able to grow\n\n00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:08.014\nmore than 15 to 20 percent\nof our food there,\n\n00:11:08.038 --> 00:11:11.534\nat least not until water is running\non the surface of Mars\n\n00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:15.878\nand we actually have the probability\nand the capability of planting crops.\n\n00:11:16.638 --> 00:11:17.894\nIn the meantime,\n\n00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:20.014\nmost of our food will arrive from Earth,\n\n00:11:20.038 --> 00:11:21.238\nand it will be dried.\n\n00:11:22.438 --> 00:11:24.518\nAnd then we need some shelter.\n\n00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:28.694\nAt first we can use inflatable,\npressurized buildings\n\n00:11:28.718 --> 00:11:30.974\nas well as the landers themselves.\n\n00:11:30.998 --> 00:11:33.974\nBut this really only works\nduring the daytime.\n\n00:11:33.998 --> 00:11:39.094\nThere is too much solar radiation\nand too much radiation from cosmic rays.\n\n00:11:39.118 --> 00:11:41.294\nSo we really have to go underground.\n\n00:11:41.318 --> 00:11:44.014\nNow, it turns out that the soil on Mars,\n\n00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:47.014\nby and large,\nis perfect for making bricks.\n\n00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:49.254\nAnd NASA has figured this one out, too.\n\n00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:52.134\nThey're going to throw\nsome polymer plastic into the bricks,\n\n00:11:52.158 --> 00:11:53.934\nshove them in a microwave oven,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.214\nand then you will be able to build\nbuildings with really thick walls.\n\n00:11:57.238 --> 00:12:03.214\nOr we may choose to live underground\nin caves or in lava tubes,\n\n00:12:03.238 --> 00:12:04.518\nof which there are plenty.\n\n00:12:05.998 --> 00:12:07.518\nAnd finally there's clothing.\n\n00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:11.294\nOn Earth we have miles\nof atmosphere piled up on us,\n\n00:12:11.318 --> 00:12:14.614\nwhich creates 15 pounds of pressure\non our bodies at all times,\n\n00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:16.781\nand we're constantly\npushing out against that.\n\n00:12:16.805 --> 00:12:19.725\nOn Mars there's hardly\nany atmospheric pressure.\n\n00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:22.574\nSo Dava Newman,\n\n00:12:22.598 --> 00:12:24.054\na scientist at MIT,\n\n00:12:24.078 --> 00:12:27.134\nhas created this sleek space suit.\n\n00:12:27.158 --> 00:12:28.654\nIt will keep us together,\n\n00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:30.918\nblock radiation and keep us warm.\n\n00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:34.014\nSo let's think about this for a minute.\n\n00:12:34.038 --> 00:12:37.038\nFood, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...\n\n00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:39.118\nwe can do this.\n\n00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:40.758\nWe really can.\n\n00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.798\nBut it's still a little complicated\nand a little difficult.\n\n00:12:45.758 --> 00:12:48.574\nSo that leads to the next big --\n\n00:12:48.598 --> 00:12:50.174\nreally big step --\n\n00:12:50.198 --> 00:12:52.014\nin living the good life on Mars.\n\n00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.838\nAnd that's terraforming the planet:\n\n00:12:54.558 --> 00:12:56.414\nmaking it more like Earth,\n\n00:12:56.438 --> 00:12:59.278\nreengineering an entire planet.\n\n00:13:00.118 --> 00:13:01.974\nThat sounds like a lot of hubris,\n\n00:13:01.998 --> 00:13:03.214\nbut the truth is\n\n00:13:03.238 --> 00:13:07.118\nthat the technology to do everything\nI'm about to tell you already exists.\n\n00:13:08.158 --> 00:13:09.878\nFirst we've got to warm it up.\n\n00:13:10.358 --> 00:13:15.054\nMars is incredibly cold\nbecause it has a very thin atmosphere.\n\n00:13:15.078 --> 00:13:19.414\nThe answer lies here, at the south pole\nand at the north pole of Mars,\n\n00:13:19.438 --> 00:13:20.694\nboth of which are covered\n\n00:13:20.718 --> 00:13:23.894\nwith an incredible amount\nof frozen carbon dioxide --\n\n00:13:23.918 --> 00:13:25.374\ndry ice.\n\n00:13:25.398 --> 00:13:26.734\nIf we heat it up,\n\n00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:29.334\nit sublimes directly into the atmosphere\n\n00:13:29.358 --> 00:13:32.174\nand thickens the atmosphere\nthe same way it does on Earth.\n\n00:13:32.198 --> 00:13:33.414\nAnd as we know,\n\n00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:37.078\nCO2 is an incredibly\npotent greenhouse gas.\n\n00:13:37.798 --> 00:13:43.734\nNow, my favorite way of doing this\nis to erect a very, very large solar sail\n\n00:13:43.758 --> 00:13:44.974\nand focus it --\n\n00:13:44.998 --> 00:13:46.734\nit essentially serves as a mirror --\n\n00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:49.134\nand focus it on the south pole\nof Mars at first.\n\n00:13:49.158 --> 00:13:53.174\nAs the planet spins, it will heat up\nall that dry ice, sublime it,\n\n00:13:53.198 --> 00:13:55.454\nand it will go into the atmosphere.\n\n00:13:55.478 --> 00:13:56.974\nIt actually won't take long\n\n00:13:56.998 --> 00:13:59.254\nfor the temperature\non Mars to start rising,\n\n00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:01.838\nprobably less than 20 years.\n\n00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:03.734\nRight now,\n\n00:14:03.758 --> 00:14:05.734\non a perfect day at the equator,\n\n00:14:05.758 --> 00:14:07.854\nin the middle of summer on Mars,\n\n00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:10.334\ntemperatures can\nactually reach 70 degrees,\n\n00:14:10.358 --> 00:14:12.774\nbut then they go down\nto minus 100 at night.\n\n00:14:12.798 --> 00:14:14.374\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:18.038\nWhat we're shooting for\nis a runaway greenhouse effect:\n\n00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:22.574\nenough temperature rise\nto see a lot of that ice on Mars --\n\n00:14:22.598 --> 00:14:25.038\nespecially the ice in the ground -- melt.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.358\nThen we get some real magic.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.134\nAs the atmosphere gets thicker,\neverything gets better.\n\n00:14:31.158 --> 00:14:33.774\nWe get more protection from radiation,\n\n00:14:33.798 --> 00:14:36.894\nmore atmosphere makes us warmer,\nmakes the planet warmer,\n\n00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.614\nso we get running water\n\n00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:40.238\nand that makes crops possible.\n\n00:14:40.878 --> 00:14:45.854\nThen more water vapor goes into the air,\nforming yet another potent greenhouse gas.\n\n00:14:45.878 --> 00:14:49.318\nIt will rain and it will snow on Mars.\n\n00:14:50.118 --> 00:14:53.374\nAnd a thicker atmosphere\nwill create enough pressure\n\n00:14:53.398 --> 00:14:55.934\nso that we can\nthrow away those space suits.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.334\nWe only need about five pounds\nof pressure to survive.\n\n00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:04.638\nEventually, Mars will be made\nto feel a lot like British Columbia.\n\n00:15:05.998 --> 00:15:08.334\nWe'll still be left\nwith the complicated problem\n\n00:15:08.358 --> 00:15:10.094\nof making the atmosphere breathable,\n\n00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:13.078\nand frankly that could take\n1,000 years to accomplish.\n\n00:15:13.758 --> 00:15:17.894\nBut humans are amazingly smart\nand incredibly adaptable.\n\n00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:22.894\nThere is no telling what our future\ntechnology will be able to accomplish\n\n00:15:22.918 --> 00:15:25.688\nand no telling what we can do\nwith our own bodies.\n\n00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:28.214\nIn biology right now,\n\n00:15:28.238 --> 00:15:33.454\nwe are on the very verge of being\nable to control our own genetics,\n\n00:15:33.478 --> 00:15:36.014\nwhat the genes\nin our own bodies are doing,\n\n00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:38.174\nand certainly,\n\n00:15:38.198 --> 00:15:40.078\neventually, our own evolution.\n\n00:15:40.878 --> 00:15:44.494\nWe could end up with a species\nof human being on Earth\n\n00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:48.558\nthat is slightly different\nfrom the species of human beings on Mars.\n\n00:15:50.238 --> 00:15:52.494\nBut what would you do there?\nHow would you live?\n\n00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.958\nIt's going to be\nthe same as it is on Earth.\n\n00:15:55.518 --> 00:15:57.774\nSomebody's going to start a restaurant,\n\n00:15:57.798 --> 00:15:59.918\nsomebody's going to build an iron foundry.\n\n00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:03.014\nSomeone will make\ndocumentary movies of Mars\n\n00:16:03.038 --> 00:16:04.438\nand sell them on Earth.\n\n00:16:06.518 --> 00:16:09.534\nSome idiot will start a reality TV show.\n\n00:16:09.558 --> 00:16:10.998\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.894\nThere will be software companies,\n\n00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:16.318\nthere will be hotels, there will be bars.\n\n00:16:17.718 --> 00:16:19.134\nThis much is certain:\n\n00:16:19.158 --> 00:16:23.374\nit will be the most disruptive\nevent in our lifetimes,\n\n00:16:23.398 --> 00:16:25.758\nand I think it will be the most inspiring.\n\n00:16:26.758 --> 00:16:30.814\nAsk any 10-year-old girl\nif she wants to go to Mars.\n\n00:16:30.838 --> 00:16:35.158\nChildren who are now in elementary school\nare going to choose to live there.\n\n00:16:36.238 --> 00:16:38.638\nRemember when we landed\nhumans on the Moon?\n\n00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:42.054\nWhen that happened,\npeople looked at each other and said,\n\n00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:44.758\n\"If we can do this, we can do anything.\"\n\n00:16:45.718 --> 00:16:49.838\nWhat are they going to think\nwhen we actually form a colony on Mars?\n\n00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:52.254\nMost importantly,\n\n00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:55.654\nit will make us a spacefaring species.\n\n00:16:55.678 --> 00:17:01.134\nAnd that means humans will survive\nno matter what happens on Earth.\n\n00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:04.254\nWe will never be the last of our kind.\n\n00:17:04.278 --> 00:17:05.494\nThank you.\n\n00:17:05.518 --> 00:17:09.098\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A new superweapon in the fight against cancer", "duration": "642", "url":

There are some forms of cancer, which, fortunately, we've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery. But there are some forms of cancer that don't respond to these approaches, and the tumor survives or comes back, even after an onslaught of drugs.We can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as kind of supervillains in a comic book. They're clever, they're adaptable, and they're very good at staying alive. And, like most supervillains these days, their superpowers come from a genetic mutation. The genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival, allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments.One example is a trick in which a gene allows a cell, even as the drug approaches the cell, to push the drug out, before the drug can have any effect. Imagine \u2014 the cell effectively spits out the drug. This is just one example of the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain, cancer. All due to mutant genes.So, we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers. And we need a new and powerful mode of attack. Actually, we can turn off a gene. The key is a set of molecules known as siRNA. siRNA are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene. Each siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell. For many years since its discovery, scientists have been very excited about how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine.But, there is a problem. siRNA works well inside the cell. But if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues, it degrades within seconds. It has to be packaged, protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell.So, here's our strategy. First, we'll dose the cancer cell with siRNA, the gene blocker, and silence those survival genes, and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug. But how do we carry that out? Using molecular engineering, we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream. It has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream, it's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue, and it's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell. To do this job well, it has to be about one one-hundredth the size of a human hair.Let's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle. First, let's start with the nanoparticle core. It's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug. This is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell's life. Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin, nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA. This is our gene blocker. Because siRNA is strongly negatively charged, we can protect it with a nice, protective layer of positively charged polymer. The two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction, and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream. We're almost done.(Laughter)But there is one more big obstacle we have to think about. In fact, it may be the biggest obstacle of all. How do we deploy this superweapon? I mean, every good weapon needs to be targeted, we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor.But our bodies have a natural immune-defense system: cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don't belong, so that it can destroy or eliminate them. And guess what? Our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object. We have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system. We have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it.So we add one more negatively charged layer around this nanoparticle, which serves two purposes. First, this outer layer is one of the naturally charged, highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body. It creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect. This invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle to travel through the bloodstream long and far enough to reach the tumor, without getting eliminated by the body.Second, this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell. Once bound, the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle, and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell and ready to deploy.Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go!(Applause)The siRNA is deployed first. It acts for hours, giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes. We have now disabled those genetic superpowers. What remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses. Then, the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently. With sufficient gene blockers, we can address many different kinds of mutations, allowing the chance to sweep out tumors, without leaving behind any bad guys.So, how does our strategy work? We've tested these nanostructure particles in animals using a highly aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer. This triple-negative breast cancer exhibits the gene that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered.Usually, doxorubicin \u2014 let's call it \"dox\" \u2014 is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. So, we first treated our animals with a dox core, dox only. The tumor slowed their rate of growth, but they still grew rapidly, doubling in size over a period of two weeks.Then, we tried our combination superweapon. A nanolayer particle with siRNA against the chemo pump, plus, we have the dox in the core. And look \u2014 we found that not only did the tumors stop growing, they actually decreased in size and were eliminated in some cases. The tumors were actually regressing.(Applause)What's great about this approach is that it can be personalized. We can add many different layers of siRNA to address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms. And we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core. As doctors learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types, they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use.Ovarian cancer strikes a special chord with me. It is a very aggressive cancer, in part because it's discovered at very late stages, when it's highly advanced and there are a number of genetic mutations. After the first round of chemotherapy, this cancer comes back for 75 percent of patients. And it usually comes back in a drug-resistant form. High-grade ovarian cancer is one of the biggest supervillains out there. And we're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat.As a researcher, I usually don't get to work with patients. But I recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor, Mimi, and her daughter, Paige. I was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength that both mother and daughter displayed and by their story of courage and support. At this event, we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer. And Mimi was in tears as she explained how learning about these efforts gives her hope for future generations, including her own daughter. This really touched me. It's not just about building really elegant science. It's about changing people's lives. It's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules.I know that as students like Paige move forward in their careers, they'll open new possibilities in addressing some of the big health problems in the world \u2014 including ovarian cancer, neurological disorders, infectious disease \u2014 just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me, and has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale, that of molecules, to heal on the human scale.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2467, "subtitle":

big obstacle\nwe have to think about.\n\n00:04:36.974 --> 00:04:39.366\nIn fact, it may be the biggest\nobstacle of all.\n\n00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.364\nHow do we deploy this superweapon?\n\n00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:43.942\nI mean, every good weapon\nneeds to be targeted,\n\n00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:48.031\nwe have to target this superweapon\nto the supervillain cells\n\n00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:50.005\nthat reside in the tumor.\n\n00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.302\nBut our bodies have a natural\nimmune-defense system:\n\n00:04:53.874 --> 00:04:55.825\ncells that reside in the bloodstream\n\n00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.194\nand pick out things that don't belong,\n\n00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:00.517\nso that it can destroy or eliminate them.\n\n00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:04.977\nAnd guess what? Our nanoparticle\nis considered a foreign object.\n\n00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:09.775\nWe have to sneak our nanoparticle\npast the tumor defense system.\n\n00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:16.053\nWe have to get it past this mechanism\nof getting rid of the foreign object\n\n00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:17.497\nby disguising it.\n\n00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:21.866\nSo we add one more\nnegatively charged layer\n\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.214\naround this nanoparticle,\n\n00:05:23.238 --> 00:05:24.676\nwhich serves two purposes.\n\n00:05:25.098 --> 00:05:29.066\nFirst, this outer layer is one\nof the naturally charged,\n\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.803\nhighly hydrated polysaccharides\nthat resides in our body.\n\n00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:38.247\nIt creates a cloud of water molecules\naround the nanoparticle\n\n00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:41.342\nthat gives us an invisibility\ncloaking effect.\n\n00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:44.932\nThis invisibility cloak allows\nthe nanoparticle\n\n00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:46.562\nto travel through the bloodstream\n\n00:05:46.586 --> 00:05:49.351\nlong and far enough to reach the tumor,\n\n00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:51.514\nwithout getting eliminated by the body.\n\n00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:56.471\nSecond, this layer contains molecules\n\n00:05:56.495 --> 00:05:59.694\nwhich bind specifically to our tumor cell.\n\n00:06:00.148 --> 00:06:04.668\nOnce bound, the cancer cell\ntakes up the nanoparticle,\n\n00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:09.066\nand now we have our nanoparticle\ninside the cancer cell\n\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.763\nand ready to deploy.\n\n00:06:11.262 --> 00:06:13.499\nAlright! I feel the same way. Let's go!\n\n00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:19.705\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:23.241\nThe siRNA is deployed first.\n\n00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:25.871\nIt acts for hours,\n\n00:06:25.895 --> 00:06:30.463\ngiving enough time to silence\nand block those survival genes.\n\n00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:35.294\nWe have now disabled\nthose genetic superpowers.\n\n00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:38.912\nWhat remains is a cancer cell\nwith no special defenses.\n\n00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:41.838\nThen, the chemotherapy drug\ncomes out of the core\n\n00:06:41.862 --> 00:06:45.446\nand destroys the tumor cell\ncleanly and efficiently.\n\n00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:48.523\nWith sufficient gene blockers,\n\n00:06:48.547 --> 00:06:51.757\nwe can address many\ndifferent kinds of mutations,\n\n00:06:51.781 -->

work?\n\n00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:05.462\nWe've tested these nanostructure\nparticles in animals\n\n00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:09.069\nusing a highly aggressive form\nof triple-negative breast cancer.\n\n00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:11.648\nThis triple-negative breast cancer\nexhibits the gene\n\n00:07:11.672 --> 00:07:15.147\nthat spits out cancer drug\nas soon as it is

00:07:34.290\nbut they still grew rapidly,\n\n00:07:34.314 --> 00:07:36.642\ndoubling in size\nover a period of two weeks.\n\n00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:40.353\nThen, we tried\nour combination superweapon.\n\n00:07:41.373 --> 00:07:45.785\nA nanolayer particle with siRNA\nagainst the chemo pump,\n\n00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:48.804\nplus, we have the dox in the core.\n\n00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:53.143\nAnd look -- we found that not only\ndid the tumors stop growing,\n\n00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:55.683\nthey actually decreased in size\n\n00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:58.122\nand were eliminated in some cases.\n\n00:07:58.146 --> 00:08:01.402\nThe tumors were actually regressing.\n\n00:08:01.817 --> 00:08:08.799\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:13.586\nWhat's great about this approach\nis that it can be personalized.\n\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.446\nWe can add many different layers of siRNA\n\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.028\nto address different mutations\nand tumor

patients\n\n00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:30.909\nand understand certain\ntumor genetic types,\n\n00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:34.675\nthey can help us determine which patients\ncan benefit from this

percent of patients.\n\n00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:01.117\nAnd it usually comes back\nin a drug-resistant form.\n\n00:09:02.173 --> 00:09:03.867\nHigh-grade ovarian cancer\n\n00:09:03.891 -->

mother\n\n00:09:18.563 --> 00:09:23.460\nwho is an ovarian cancer survivor,\nMimi, and her daughter, Paige.\n\n00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:28.319\nI was deeply inspired\nby the optimism and strength\n\n00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:30.436\nthat both mother and daughter displayed\n\n00:09:31.453 --> 00:09:34.145\nand by their story of courage and support.\n\n00:09:35.077 --> 00:09:38.480\nAt

of celebrating failure", "duration": "932", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/astro_teller_the_unexpected_benefit_of_celebrating_failure", "transcript": "In 1962 at Rice University, JFK told the country about a dream he had, a dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade. The eponymous moonshot.No one knew if it was possible to do but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible. That's how great dreams are. Great dreams aren't just visions, they're visions coupled to strategies for making them real.I have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory. At X \u2014 formerly called Google X \u2014 you'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer and former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts. These inventors, engineers and makers are dreaming up technologies that we hope can make the world a wonderful place.We use the word \"moonshots\" to remind us to keep our visions big \u2014 to keep dreaming. And we use the word \"factory\" to remind ourselves that we want to have concrete visions \u2014 concrete plans to make them real.Here's our moonshot blueprint. Number one: we want to find a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people. Number two: we want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem. And then number three: there has to be some reason to believe that the technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.But I have a secret for you. The moonshot factory is a messy place. But rather than avoid the mess, pretend it's not there, we've tried to make that our strength. We spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove that we're wrong. That's it, that's the secret. Run at all the hardest parts of the problem first. Get excited and cheer, \"Hey! How are we going to kill our project today?\"We've got this interesting balance going where we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions. But then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism to breathe life, breathe reality into those visions.I want to show you a few of the projects that we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor, and also a few of the gems that at least so far, have not only survived that process, but have been accelerated by it.Last year we killed a project in automated vertical farming. This is some of the lettuce that we grew. One in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment. So this is a moonshot that needs to happen. Vertical farming uses 10 times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming. And because you can grow the food close to where it's consumed, you don't have to transport it large distances. We made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting. But unfortunately, we couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way. So we killed the project.Here's another huge problem. We pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage to ship goods worldwide. Economic development of landlocked countries is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure. The radical solution? A lighter-than-air, variable-buoyancy cargo ship. This has the potential to lower, at least overall, the cost, time and carbon footprint of shipping without needing runways. We came up with this clever set of technical breakthroughs that together might make it possible for us to lower the cost enough that we could actually make these ships \u2014 inexpensively enough in volume. But however cheap they would have been to make in volume it turned out that it was going to cost close to 200 million dollars to design and build the first one.200 million dollars is just way too expensive. Because X is structured with these tight feedback loops of making mistakes and learning and new designs, we can't spend 200 million dollars to get the first data point about whether we're on the right track or not. If there's an Achilles' heel in one our projects, we want to know it now, up front, not way down the road. So we killed this project, too.Discovering a major flaw in a project doesn't always mean that it ends the project. Sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path.This is our fully self-driving vehicle prototype, which we built without a steering wheel or break pedal. But that wasn't actually our goal when we started.With 1.2 million people dying on the roads globally every year, building a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take. Three and a half years ago, when we had these Lexus, retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing, they were doing so well, we gave them out to other Googlers to find out what they thought of the experience. And what we discovered was that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving and just hand over to the users in case of emergency was a really bad plan. It wasn't safe because the users didn't do their job. They didn't stay alert in case the car needed to hand control back to them.This was a major crisis for the team. It sent them back to the drawing board. And they came up with a beautiful, new perspective. Aim for a car where you're truly a passenger. You tell the car where you want to go, you push a button and it takes you from point A to point B by itself.We're really grateful that we had this insight as early on in the project as we did. And it's shaped everything we've done since then. And now our cars have self-driven more than 1.4 million miles, and they're out everyday on the streets of Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas.The cars team shifted their perspective. This is one of X's mantras. Sometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart.Take wind energy. It's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting. There's no way that we're going to build a better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry. But we found a way to get up higher into the sky, and so get access to faster, more consistent winds, and so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there.Our Makani energy kite rises up from its perch by spinning up those propellers along its wing. And it pulls out a tether as it rises, pulling energy up through the tether. Once the tether's all the way out, it goes into crosswind circles in the sky. And now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines. And that sends energy back down the tether.We haven't yet found a way to kill this project. And the longer it survives that pressure, the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world.Probably the craziest sounding project we have is Project Loon. We're trying to make balloon-powered Internet. A network of balloons in the stratosphere that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world. This could bring online as many as four billion more people, who today have little or no internet connection.But you can't just take a cell tower, strap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky. The winds are too strong, it would be blown away. And the balloons are too high up to tie it to the ground.Here comes the crazy moment. What if, instead, we let the balloons drift and we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go? It turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata. So we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world, we could maneuver the balloons a bit, getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere to grab those winds going in those different directions and speeds. The idea is to have enough balloons so as one balloon floats out of your area, there's another balloon ready to float into place, handing off the internet connection, just like your phone hands off between cell towers as you drive down the freeway.We get how crazy that vision sounds \u2014 there's the name of the project to remind us of that. So since 2012, the Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely to kill their project.The first thing that they did was try to get a Wi-Fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere down to an antenna on the ground. It worked. And I promise you there were bets that it wasn't going to. So we kept going.Could we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets, so that we didn't need the antenna as an intermediary receiver? Yeah.Could we get the balloon bandwidth high enough so it was a real Internet connection? So that people could have something more than just SMS? The early tests weren't even a megabit per second, but now we can do up to 15 megabits per second. Enough to watch a TED Talk.Could we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky so that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas? Check.Could we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than 100 days, while costing less than five percent of what traditional, long-life balloons have cost to make? Yes. In the end. But I promise you, you name it, we had to try it to get there. We made round, silvery balloons. We made giant pillow-shaped balloons. We made balloons the size of a blue whale. We busted a lot of balloons.(Laughter)Since one of the things that was most likely to kill the Loon project was whether we could guide the balloons through the sky, one of our most important experiments was putting a balloon inside a balloon.So there are two compartments here, one with air and then one with helium. The balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier, or lets air out to make it lighter. And these weight changes allow it to rise or fall, and that simple movement of the balloon is its steering mechanism. It floats up or down, hoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants.But is that good enough for it to navigate through the world? Barely at first, but better all the time.This particular balloon, our latest balloon, can navigate a two-mile vertical stretch of sky and can sail itself to within 500 meters of where it wants to go from 20,000 kilometers away.We have lots more to do in terms of fine-tuning the system and reducing costs. But last year, a balloon built inexpensively went around the world 19 times over 187 days. So we're going to keep going.(Applause)Our balloons today are doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do. We're in discussions with telcos around the world, and we're going to fly over places like Indonesia for real service testing this year.This probably all sounds too good to be true, and you're right. Being audacious and working on big, risky things makes people inherently uncomfortable.You cannot yell at people and force them to fail fast. People resist. They worry. \"What will happen to me if I fail? Will people laugh at me? Will I be fired?\"I started with our secret. I'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen. The only way to get people to work on big, risky things \u2014 audacious ideas \u2014 and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first, is if you make that the path of least resistance for them.We work hard at X to make it safe to fail. Teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table because they're rewarded for it. They get applause from their peers. Hugs and high fives from their manager, me in particular. They get promoted for it. We have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects, from teams as small as two to teams of more than 30.We believe in dreams at the moonshot factory. But enthusiastic skepticism is not the enemy of boundless optimism. It's optimism's perfect partner. It unlocks the potential in every idea. We can create the future that's in our dreams.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2460, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:16.038\nIn 1962 at Rice University,\n\n00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:21.134\nJFK told the country about a dream he had,\n\n00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:25.054\na dream to put a person on the moon\nby the end of the decade.\n\n00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:26.478\nThe eponymous moonshot.\n\n00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:30.654\nNo one knew if it was possible to do\n\n00:00:30.678 --> 00:00:35.038\nbut he made sure a plan was put in place\nto do it if it was possible.\n\n00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:37.294\nThat's how great dreams are.\n\n00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:39.774\nGreat dreams aren't just visions,\n\n00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:43.478\nthey're visions coupled to strategies\nfor making them real.\n\n00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:49.454\nI have the incredible good fortune\nto work at a moonshot factory.\n\n00:00:49.478 --> 00:00:51.774\nAt X -- formerly called Google X --\n\n00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:56.494\nyou'll find an aerospace engineer\nworking alongside a fashion designer\n\n00:00:56.518 --> 00:01:01.238\nand former military ops commanders\nbrainstorming with laser experts.\n\n00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:07.494\nThese inventors, engineers and makers\nare dreaming up technologies\n\n00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:11.278\nthat we hope can make the world\na wonderful place.\n\n00:01:12.158 --> 00:01:16.694\nWe use the word \"moonshots\"\nto remind us to keep our visions big --\n\n00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:18.414\nto keep dreaming.\n\n00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:22.894\nAnd we use the word \"factory\"\nto remind ourselves\n\n00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:26.014\nthat we want to have concrete visions --\n\n00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:29.334\nconcrete plans to make them real.\n\n00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:31.294\nHere's our moonshot blueprint.\n\n00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:32.534\nNumber one:\n\n00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:34.974\nwe want to find\na huge problem in the world\n\n00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:37.254\nthat affects many millions of people.\n\n00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:38.774\nNumber two:\n\n00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:42.598\nwe want to find or propose a radical\nsolution for solving that problem.\n\n00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:44.814\nAnd then number three:\n\n00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.814\nthere has to be some reason to believe\n\n00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:50.894\nthat the technology\nfor such a radical solution\n\n00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:52.358\ncould actually be built.\n\n00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:55.454\nBut I have a secret for you.\n\n00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:58.718\nThe moonshot factory is a messy place.\n\n00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:01.374\nBut rather than avoid the mess,\n\n00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:02.934\npretend it's not there,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.798\nwe've tried to make that our strength.\n\n00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:08.854\nWe spend most of our time breaking things\n\n00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.838\nand trying to prove that we're wrong.\n\n00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:13.918\nThat's it, that's the secret.\n\n00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:18.174\nRun at all the hardest\nparts of the problem first.\n\n00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:20.253\nGet excited and cheer,\n\n00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:22.717\n\"Hey!

X is structured\nwith these tight feedback loops\n\n00:04:48.158 --> 00:04:51.814\nof making mistakes\nand learning and new designs,\n\n00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:53.574\nwe can't spend 200 million dollars\n\n00:04:53.598 --> 00:04:55.334\nto get the first data point\n\n00:04:55.358 --> 00:04:57.918\nabout whether we're\non the right track or not.\n\n00:04:58.558 --> 00:05:00.894\nIf there's an Achilles' heel\nin one our projects,\n\n00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:05.214\nwe want to know it now, up front,\nnot way down the road.\n\n00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.918\nSo we killed this project, too.\n\n00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:11.574\nDiscovering a major flaw in a project\n\n00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:13.734\ndoesn't always mean\nthat it ends the project.\n\n00:05:13.758 --> 00:05:16.934\nSometimes it actually gets us\nonto a more productive path.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.894\nThis is our fully self-driving\nvehicle prototype,\n\n00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:24.078\nwhich we built without\na steering wheel or break pedal.\n\n00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:27.158\nBut that wasn't actually\nour goal when we started.\n\n00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:33.614\nWith 1.2 million people dying\non the roads globally every year,\n\n00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:37.454\nbuilding a car that drives itself\nwas a natural moonshot to take.\n\n00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:39.078\nThree and a half years ago,\n\n00:05:39.878 --> 00:05:45.454\nwhen we had these Lexus,\nretrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,\n\n00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:49.134\nthey were doing so well,\nwe gave them out to other Googlers\n\n00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:51.398\nto find out what they thought\nof the experience.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.214\nAnd what we discovered\n\n00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:57.854\nwas that our plan to have the cars\ndo almost all the driving\n\n00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:01.774\nand just hand over to the users\nin case of emergency\n\n00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:04.878\nwas a really bad plan.\n\n00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:07.814\nIt wasn't safe\n\n00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:10.974\nbecause the users didn't do their job.\n\n00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:12.438\nThey didn't stay alert\n\n00:06:13.118 --> 00:06:17.174\nin case the car needed\nto hand control back to them.\n\n00:06:17.198 --> 00:06:19.214\nThis was a major crisis for the team.\n\n00:06:19.238 --> 00:06:21.278\nIt sent them back to the drawing board.\n\n00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:25.638\nAnd they came up\nwith a beautiful, new perspective.\n\n00:06:26.558 --> 00:06:30.278\nAim for a car where\nyou're truly a passenger.\n\n00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:33.494\nYou tell the car where you want to go,\n\n00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.774\nyou push a button\n\n00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:38.958\nand it takes you\nfrom point A to point B by itself.\n\n00:06:39.678 --> 00:06:40.974\nWe're really grateful\n\n00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:44.534\nthat we had this insight\nas early on in the project as we did.\n\n00:06:44.558 --> 00:06:48.518\nAnd it's shaped everything\nwe've done since then.\n\n00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:55.494\nAnd now our cars have self-driven\nmore than 1.4 million miles,\n\n00:06:55.518 --> 00:06:57.134\nand they're out everyday\n\n00:06:57.158 --> 00:07:01.198\non the streets of Mountain View,\nCalifornia and Austin, Texas.\n\n00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:05.934\nThe cars team shifted their perspective.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.014\nThis is one of X's mantras.\n\n00:07:08.038 --> 00:07:12.838\nSometimes shifting your perspective\nis more powerful than being smart.\n\n00:07:13.838 --> 00:07:15.334\nTake wind energy.\n\n00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:18.694\nIt's one of my favorite examples\nof perspective shifting.\n\n00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:21.574\nThere's no way that we're going to build\n\n00:07:21.598 --> 00:07:25.998\na better standard wind turbine\nthan the experts in that industry.\n\n00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:31.574\nBut we found a way\nto get up higher into the sky,\n\n00:07:31.598 --> 00:07:35.414\nand so get access to faster,\nmore consistent winds,\n\n00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:41.094\nand so more energy without needing\nhundreds of tons of steel to get there.\n\n00:07:41.118 --> 00:07:44.454\nOur Makani energy kite\nrises up from its perch\n\n00:07:44.478 --> 00:07:47.494\nby spinning up those\npropellers along its wing.\n\n00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:49.838\nAnd it pulls out a tether as it rises,\n\n00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:52.494\npulling energy up through the tether.\n\n00:07:52.518 --> 00:07:54.374\nOnce the tether's all the way out,\n\n00:07:54.398 --> 00:07:57.558\nit goes into crosswind circles in the sky.\n\n00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:03.638\nAnd now those propellers that lifted it up\nhave become flying turbines.\n\n00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:07.038\nAnd that sends energy\nback down the tether.\n\n00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:10.694\nWe haven't yet found\na way to kill this project.\n\n00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:14.814\nAnd the longer it survives that pressure,\nthe more excited we get\n\n00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:19.294\nthat this could become\na cheaper and more deployable form\n\n00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:21.238\nof wind energy for the world.\n\n00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:26.518\nProbably the craziest sounding project\nwe have is Project Loon.\n\n00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:30.814\nWe're trying to make\nballoon-powered Internet.\n\n00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:33.918\nA network of balloons in the stratosphere\n\n00:08:34.758 --> 00:08:39.854\nthat beam an internet connection down\nto rural and remote areas of the world.\n\n00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:43.774\nThis could bring online\nas many as four billion more people,\n\n00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:46.038\nwho today have little\nor no internet connection.\n\n00:08:47.078 --> 00:08:49.973\nBut you can't just take a cell tower,\n\n00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.894\nstrap it to a balloon\nand stick it in the sky.\n\n00:08:52.918 --> 00:08:55.294\nThe winds are too strong,\nit would be blown away.\n\n00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:59.718\nAnd the balloons are too high up\nto tie it to the ground.\n\n00:09:00.758 --> 00:09:02.198\nHere comes the crazy moment.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.054\nWhat if, instead,\n\n00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:07.294\nwe let the balloons drift\n\n00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:11.158\nand we taught them how to sail the winds\nto go where the needed to go?\n\n00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:16.854\nIt turns out the stratosphere has winds\n\n00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:20.974\nthat are going in quite different\nspeeds and directions in thin strata.\n\n00:09:20.998 --> 00:09:25.878\nSo we hoped that using smart algorithms\nand wind data from around the world,\n\n00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:29.214\nwe could maneuver the balloons a bit,\n\n00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:32.334\ngetting them to go up and down\njust a tiny bit in the stratosphere\n\n00:09:32.358 --> 00:09:35.974\nto grab those winds going\nin those different directions and speeds.\n\n00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:38.294\nThe idea is to have enough balloons\n\n00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:41.174\nso as one balloon floats out of your area,\n\n00:09:41.198 --> 00:09:44.934\nthere's another balloon\nready to float into place,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.574\nhanding off the internet connection,\n\n00:09:47.598 --> 00:09:51.054\njust like your phone\nhands off between cell towers\n\n00:09:51.078 --> 00:09:52.718\nas you drive down the freeway.\n\n00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:58.134\nWe get how crazy that vision sounds --\n\n00:09:58.158 --> 00:10:00.894\nthere's the name of the project\nto remind us of that.\n\n00:10:00.918 --> 00:10:03.254\nSo since 2012,\n\n00:10:03.278 --> 00:10:09.054\nthe Loon team has prioritized\nthe work that seems the most difficult\n\n00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:12.918\nand so the most likely\nto kill their project.\n\n00:10:13.878 --> 00:10:15.414\nThe first thing that they did\n\n00:10:15.438 --> 00:10:19.654\nwas try to get a Wi-Fi connection\nfrom a balloon in the stratosphere\n\n00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:21.798\ndown to an antenna on the ground.\n\n00:10:22.678 --> 00:10:23.894\nIt worked.\n\n00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:26.633\nAnd I promise you there were bets\nthat it wasn't going to.\n\n00:10:26.657 --> 00:10:27.897\nSo we kept going.\n\n00:10:28.838 --> 00:10:32.214\nCould we get the balloon\nto talk directly to handsets,\n\n00:10:32.238 --> 00:10:35.598\nso that we didn't need the antenna\nas an intermediary receiver?\n\n00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:37.878\nYeah.\n\n00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.254\nCould we get the balloon\nbandwidth high enough\n\n00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:44.014\nso it was a real Internet connection?\n\n00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:48.998\nSo that people could have\nsomething more than just SMS?\n\n00:10:49.598 --> 00:10:53.414\nThe early tests weren't even\na megabit per second,\n\n00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:56.854\nbut now we can do\nup to 15 megabits per second.\n\n00:10:56.878 --> 00:10:58.198\nEnough to watch a TED Talk.\n\n00:10:59.318 --> 00:11:02.894\nCould we get the balloons\nto talk to each other through the sky\n\n00:11:02.918 --> 00:11:07.774\nso that we could reach our signal\ndeeper into rural areas?\n\n00:11:07.798 --> 00:11:09.334\nCheck.\n\n00:11:09.358 --> 00:11:16.014\nCould we get balloons the size of a house\nto stay up for more than 100 days,\n\n00:11:16.038 --> 00:11:18.334\nwhile costing less than five percent\n\n00:11:18.358 --> 00:11:21.918\nof what traditional, long-life\nballoons have cost to make?\n\n00:11:23.598 --> 00:11:25.494\nYes. In the end.\n\n00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:30.558\nBut I promise you, you name it,\nwe had to try it to get there.\n\n00:11:31.438 --> 00:11:34.278\nWe made round, silvery balloons.\n\n00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:38.598\nWe made giant pillow-shaped balloons.\n\n00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:43.238\nWe made balloons the size of a blue whale.\n\n00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:47.334\nWe busted a lot of balloons.\n\n00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:48.974\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:48.998 --> 00:11:53.054\nSince one of the things that was\nmost likely to kill the Loon project\n\n00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:56.134\nwas whether we could guide\nthe balloons through the sky,\n\n00:11:56.158 --> 00:12:00.918\none of our most important experiments\nwas putting a balloon inside a balloon.\n\n00:12:02.238 --> 00:12:06.038\nSo there are two compartments here,\none with air and then one with helium.\n\n00:12:07.318 --> 00:12:11.174\nThe balloon pumps air in\nto make itself heavier,\n\n00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:13.558\nor lets air out to make it lighter.\n\n00:12:14.478 --> 00:12:17.774\nAnd these weight changes\nallow it to rise or fall,\n\n00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:21.534\nand that simple movement of the balloon\nis its steering mechanism.\n\n00:12:21.558 --> 00:12:23.214\nIt floats up or down,\n\n00:12:23.238 --> 00:12:27.158\nhoping to grab winds going in the speed\nand direction that it wants.\n\n00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:32.078\nBut is that good enough\nfor it to navigate through the world?\n\n00:12:32.758 --> 00:12:35.294\nBarely at first,\n\n00:12:35.318 --> 00:12:36.694\nbut better all the time.\n\n00:12:36.718 --> 00:12:38.798\nThis particular balloon,\nour latest balloon,\n\n00:12:39.638 --> 00:12:43.198\ncan navigate a two-mile\nvertical stretch of sky\n\n00:12:44.238 --> 00:12:48.294\nand can sail itself to within 500 meters\nof where it wants to go\n\n00:12:48.318 --> 00:12:50.918\nfrom 20,000 kilometers away.\n\n00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:58.534\nWe have lots more to do\n\n00:12:58.558 --> 00:13:03.134\nin terms of fine-tuning\nthe system and reducing costs.\n\n00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:06.174\nBut last year,\na balloon built inexpensively\n\n00:13:06.198 --> 00:13:12.334\nwent around the world\n19 times over 187 days.\n\n00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:13.798\nSo we're going to keep going.\n\n00:13:15.078 --> 00:13:18.398\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:21.478 --> 00:13:22.734\nOur balloons today\n\n00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:26.118\nare doing pretty much everything\na complete system needs to do.\n\n00:13:27.118 --> 00:13:29.974\nWe're in discussions\nwith telcos around the world,\n\n00:13:29.998 --> 00:13:32.334\nand we're going to fly\nover places like Indonesia\n\n00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:35.094\nfor real service testing this year.\n\n00:13:35.118 --> 00:13:37.678\nThis probably all sounds\ntoo good to be true,\n\n00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:39.958\nand you're right.\n\n00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:43.014\nBeing audacious\n\n00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:45.694\nand working on big, risky things\n\n00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:48.198\nmakes people inherently uncomfortable.\n\n00:13:48.998 --> 00:13:54.078\nYou cannot yell at people\nand force them to fail fast.\n\n00:13:55.398 --> 00:13:57.494\nPeople resist. They worry.\n\n00:13:57.518 --> 00:14:00.574\n\"What will happen to me if I fail?\n\n00:14:00.598 --> 00:14:02.078\nWill people laugh at me?\n\n00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:04.278\nWill I be fired?\"\n\n00:14:05.838 --> 00:14:08.534\nI started with our secret.\n\n00:14:08.558 --> 00:14:11.438\nI'm going to leave you\nwith how we actually make it happen.\n\n00:14:12.878 --> 00:14:17.894\nThe only way to get people\nto work on big, risky things --\n\n00:14:17.918 --> 00:14:19.654\naudacious ideas --\n\n00:14:19.678 --> 00:14:24.614\nand have them run at all\nthe hardest parts of the problem first,\n\n00:14:24.638 --> 00:14:28.518\nis if you make that the path\nof least resistance for them.\n\n00:14:29.318 --> 00:14:33.198\nWe work hard at X to make it safe to fail.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:37.894\nTeams kill their ideas\nas soon as the evidence is on the table\n\n00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.478\nbecause they're rewarded for it.\n\n00:14:41.118 --> 00:14:43.934\nThey get applause from their peers.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.838\nHugs and high fives\nfrom their manager, me in particular.\n\n00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:51.614\nThey get promoted for it.\n\n00:14:51.638 --> 00:14:57.894\nWe have bonused every single person\non teams that ended their projects,\n\n00:14:57.918 --> 00:15:00.934\nfrom teams as small as two\nto teams of more than 30.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.878\nWe believe in dreams\nat the moonshot factory.\n\n00:15:04.798 --> 00:15:07.294\nBut enthusiastic skepticism\n\n00:15:07.318 --> 00:15:10.774\nis not the enemy of boundless optimism.\n\n00:15:10.798 --> 00:15:13.478\nIt's optimism's perfect partner.\n\n00:15:14.238 --> 00:15:18.558\nIt unlocks the potential in every idea.\n\n00:15:19.678 --> 00:15:23.438\nWe can create the future\nthat's in our dreams.\n\n00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:25.654\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:25.678 --> 00:15:31.700\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The nit-picking glory of The New Yorker's Comma Queen", "duration": "589", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_norris_the_nit_picking_glory_of_the_new_yorker_s_comma_queen", "transcript": "I have spent the past 38 years trying to be invisible. I'm a copy editor. I work at The New Yorker, and copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a Major League Baseball team: every little movement gets picked over by the critics \u2014 God forbid you should commit an error.Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose what goes into the magazine. We work at the level of the sentence, maybe the paragraph, the words, the punctuation. Our business is in the details. We put the diaeresis, the double dot, over the \"i\" in \"na\u00efve.\" We impose house style. Every publication has a house style. The New Yorker's is particularly distinctive. We sometimes get teased for our style. Imagine \u2014 we still spell \"teen-ager\" with a hyphen, as if that word had just been coined. But you see that hyphen in \"teen-age\" and that diaeresis over \"co\u00f6perate,\" and you know you're reading The New Yorker.Copyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process. There is a related role called query proofreading, or page-OK'ing. Whereas copyediting is mechanical, query proofreading is interpretive. We make suggestions to the author through the editor to improve the emphasis of a sentence or point out unintentional repetitions and supply compelling alternatives. Our purpose is to make the author look good.Note that we give our proofs not directly to the author, but to the editor. This often creates a good cop/bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor \u2014 I'll use that as an umbrella term \u2014 is invariably the bad cop. If we do our job well, we're invisible, but as soon as we make a mistake, we copy editors become glaringly visible. Here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door.[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin, the pre-Trump embodiment of populist no-nothingism in the Republican Party, endorsed Trump.]\"Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy editors?\" a reader wrote. \"Didn't the writer mean 'know-nothingism'?\"Ouch. There's no excuse for this mistake. But I like it: \"no-nothingism.\" It might be American vernacular for \"nihilism.\"(Laughter)Here, another reader quotes a passage from the magazine:[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained her authoritative bearing; only her unsteady gait belied her age.]He added: \"Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied,' and that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence. Come on! Get it together.\"Belie: to give a false impression. It should have been \"betrayed.\"E.B. White once wrote of commas in The New Yorker: \"They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body.\"(Laughter)And it's true \u2014 we get a lot of complaints about commas. \"Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?\" There may not be on the sign, but yes, that is New Yorker style for \"Jr.\" One wag wrote:[\"Please, could you expel, or, at least, restrain, the comma-maniac, on your editorial staff?\"](Laughter)Ah, well. In this case, those commas are well-placed, except that there should not be one between \"maniac\" and \"on.\"(Laughter)Also, if we must have commas around \"at least,\" we might change it up by using dashes around that phrase: \"... \u2014 or, at least, restrain \u2014\" Perfect.(Applause)Then there's this: \"Love you, love your magazine, but can you please stop writing massive numbers as text?\"[two and a half million ...]No.(Laughter)One last cri de coeur from a spelling stickler:[\"Those long stringy things are vocal cords, not chords.\"]The outraged reader added, \"I'm sure I'm not the first to write regarding this egregious proofreading error, but I'm equally sure I won't be the last. Fie!\"(Laughter)I used to like getting mail.There is a pact between writers and editors. The editor never sells out the writer, never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long. A great editor saves a writer from her excesses. Copy editors, too, have a code; we don't advertise our oversights. I feel disloyal divulging them here, so let's have look at what we do right.Somehow, I've gotten a reputation for sternness. But I work with writers who know how to have their way with me. I've known Ian Frazier, or \"Sandy,\" since the early 80s. And he's one of my favorites, even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause. Here is one from a story about Staten Island after Hurricane Sandy:[A dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half sloped down toward the water, its support pipes and wires leaning forward like when you open a box of linguine and it slides out.](Laughter)This would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore. But what could I do? Technically, the \"like\" should be an \"as,\" but it sounds ridiculous, as if the author were about to embark on an extended Homeric simile \u2014 \"as when you open a box of linguine.\"(Laughter)I decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy and let the sentence stand.(Laughter)Generally, if I think something is wrong, I query it three times. I told Sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said,\"Only three?\"So, he has learned to hold out.Recently, he wrote a story for \"Talk of the Town,\" that's the section at the front of the magazine with short pieces on subjects ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum to the introduction of doggie bags in France. Sandy's story was about the return to the Bronx of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. There were three things in it that I had to challenge.First, a grammar query. The justice was wearing black and Sandy wrote,[Her face and hands stood out like in an old, mostly dark painting.]Now, unlike with the hurricane, with this \"like,\" the author didn't have the excuse of describing hurricane damage. \"Like\" in this sense is a preposition, and a preposition takes an object, which is a noun. This \"like\" had to be an \"as.\" \"As in an old, mostly dark painting.\"Second, a spelling issue. The author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice:[\"It will be just a minute. We are getting the justice mic'ed,\"]Mic'ed? The music industry spells it \"mic\" because that's how it's spelled on the equipment. I'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling, and I was distraught to think that \"mic'ed\" would get into the magazine on my watch.(Laughter)New Yorker style for \"microphone\" in its abbreviated form is \"mike.\"Finally, there was a sticky grammar and usage issue in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number as its antecedent.[everyone in the vicinity held their breath]\"Their\" is plural and \"everyone,\" its antecedent, is singular. You would never say, \"Everyone were there.\" Everyone was there. Everyone is here. But people say things like, \"Everyone held their breath\" all the time. To give it legitimacy, copy editors call it \"the singular 'their,'\" as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural.(Laughter)It is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it. I couldn't make it, \"Everyone held her breath,\" or \"Everyone held his breath,\" or \"Everyone held his or her breath.\" Whatever I suggested had to blend in. I asked, through the editor, if the author would consider changing it to \"All in the vicinity held their breath,\" because \"all\" is plural. Nope.I tried again: \"All those present held their breath?\" I thought this sounded vaguely judicial. But the editor pointed out that we could not have \"present\" and \"presence\" in the same sentence. When the final proof came back, the author had accepted \"as\" for \"like,\" and \"miked\" for \"mic'ed.\" But on \"Everyone held their breath,\" he stood his ground. Two out of three isn't bad.In the same issue, in that piece on doggie bags in France, there was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a Frenchman. I wonder, when the mail comes in, which will have offended the readers more.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2479, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.804\nI have spent the past 38 years\ntrying to be invisible.\n\n00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:21.217\nI'm a copy editor.\n\n00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.465\nI work at The New Yorker,\n\n00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.663\nand copyediting for The New Yorker\nis like playing shortstop\n\n00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:29.901\nfor a Major League Baseball team:\n\n00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:33.338\nevery little movement\ngets picked over by the critics --\n\n00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:35.964\nGod forbid you should commit an error.\n\n00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:40.981\nJust to clarify: copy editors don't choose\nwhat goes into the magazine.\n\n00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:43.866\nWe work at the level of the sentence,\n\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.578\nmaybe the paragraph,\n\n00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:47.680\nthe words, the punctuation.\n\n00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.838\nOur business is in the details.\n\n00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:55.996\nWe put the diaeresis, the double dot,\nover the \"i\" in \"na\u00efve.\"\n\n00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.476\nWe impose house style.\n\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.186\nEvery publication has a house style.\n\n00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.733\nThe New Yorker's\nis particularly distinctive.\n\n00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.241\nWe sometimes get teased for our style.\n\n00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:11.605\nImagine -- we still spell\n\"teen-ager\" with a hyphen,\n\n00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:13.905\nas if that word had just been coined.\n\n00:01:14.877 --> 00:01:18.477\nBut you see that hyphen in \"teen-age\"\n\n00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:21.093\nand that diaeresis over \"co\u00f6perate,\"\n\n00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:23.119\nand you know you're reading\nThe New Yorker.\n\n00:01:23.808 --> 00:01:27.306\nCopyediting at The New Yorker\nis a mechanical process.\n\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.529\nThere is a related role called\nquery proofreading,\n\n00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:32.409\nor page-OK'ing.\n\n00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:35.687\nWhereas copyediting is mechanical,\n\n00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.186\nquery proofreading is interpretive.\n\n00:01:38.654 --> 00:01:42.026\nWe make suggestions to the author\nthrough the editor\n\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.671\nto improve the emphasis of a sentence\n\n00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:47.329\nor point out unintentional repetitions\n\n00:01:47.353 --> 00:01:51.349\nand supply compelling alternatives.\n\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.438\nOur purpose is to make\nthe author look good.\n\n00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:58.791\nNote that we give our proofs\nnot directly to the author,\n\n00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:00.334\nbut to the editor.\n\n00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:04.475\nThis often creates\na good cop/bad cop dynamic\n\n00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.023\nin which the copy editor -- I'll use that\nas an umbrella term --\n\n00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:11.054\nis invariably the bad cop.\n\n00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:14.403\nIf we do our job well, we're invisible,\n\n00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:16.499\nbut as soon as we make a mistake,\n\n00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:20.339\nwe copy editors become glaringly visible.\n\n00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:24.915\nHere is the most recent mistake\nthat was laid at my door.\n\n00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.413\n[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin,\nthe pre-Trump embodiment\n\n00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:32.583\nof populist no-nothingism\nin the Republican Party,\n\n00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:34.054\nendorsed Trump.]\n\n00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:39.101\n\"Where were The New Yorker's fabled\ncopy editors?\" a reader wrote.\n\n00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.291\n\"Didn't the writer mean\n'know-nothingism'?\"\n\n00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.024\nOuch.\n\n00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:46.720\nThere's no excuse for this mistake.\n\n00:02:46.744 --> 00:02:49.833\nBut I like it: \"no-nothingism.\"\n\n00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:53.815\nIt might be American\nvernacular for \"nihilism.\"\n\n00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.046\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.094\nHere, another reader quotes\na passage from the magazine:\n\n00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:04.155\n[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained\nher authoritative bearing;\n\n00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:08.157\nonly her unsteady gait belied her age.]\n\n00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:09.879\nHe added:\n\n00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:12.986\n\"Surely, someone at The New Yorker\nknows the meaning of 'belied,'\n\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.218\nand that it is the opposite\nof how it is used in this sentence.\n\n00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:17.916\nCome on!

Maybe you don't believe it, but here is the fact.On December 12, 2015, in Paris, under the United Nations, 195 governments got together and unanimously \u2014 if you've worked with governments, you know how difficult that is \u2014 unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable and improve the life of all of us. Now, that is a remarkable achievement.(Applause)But it is even more remarkable if you consider where we had been just a few years ago. 2009, Copenhagen. Who remembers Copenhagen? Well, after years of working toward a climate agreement, the same governments convened in Copenhagen and failed miserably.Why did it fail miserably? For many different reasons, but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global North and the global South. So now, six months after this failure, I was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations. You can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new job. The global mood on climate change was in the trash can. No one believed that a global agreement could ever be possible. In fact, neither did I. If you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful TED audience, I'm going to divulge a secret that has been gratefully buried by history. On my first press conference, a journalist asked, \"Um, Ms. Figueres, do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible?\" And without engaging brain, I heard me utter, \"Not in my lifetime.\" Well, you can imagine the faces of my press team who were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman who was their new boss. And I was horrified, too. Now, I wasn't horrified at me, because I'm kind of used to myself. I was actually horrified at the consequences of what I had just said, at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have to live. It was frankly a horrible moment for me, and I thought, well, no, hang on, hang on. Impossible is not a fact, it's an attitude. It's only an attitude. And I decided right then and there that I was going to change my attitude and I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change.So I don't know \u2014 No, just this? Thanks. I don't know \u2014 what you would do if you were told your job is to save the planet. Put that on the job description. And you have full responsibility, but you have absolutely no authority, because governments are sovereign in every decision that they take.Well, I would really love to know what you would do on the first Monday morning, but here's what I did: I panicked.(Laughter)And then I panicked again, because I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem. And then I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem, but I do know one thing: we have got to change the tone of this conversation. Because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism.And here, I use optimism as a very simple word, but let's understand it in its broader sense. Let's understand it as courage, hope, trust, solidarity, the fundamental belief that we humans can come together and can help each other to better the fate of mankind. Well, you can imagine that I thought that without that, there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen. And for six years, I have stubbornly, relentlessly injected optimism into the system, no matter what the questions from the press \u2014 and I have gotten better at those \u2014 and no matter what the evidence to the contrary. And believe you me, there has been a lot of contrary evidence. But relentless optimism into the system.And pretty soon, we began to see changes happening in many areas, precipitated by thousands of people, including many of you here today, and I thank you. And this TED community will not be surprised if I tell you the first area in which we saw remarkable change was ... technology. We began to see that clean technologies, in particular renewable energy technologies, began to drop price and increase in capacity, to the point where today we are already building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities, to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent buildings. And with this shift in technologies, we were able to begin to understand that there was a shift in the economic equation, because we were able to recognize that yes, there are huge costs to climate change, and yes, there are compounded risks. But there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits, because the dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air, better health, better transportation, more livable cities, more energy security, more energy access to the developing world. In sum, a better world than what we have now.And with that understanding, you should have witnessed, in fact, part of you were, the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through, first through nonnational governments, the private sector, captains of industry, insurance companies, investors, city leaders, faith communities, because they all began to understand, this actually can be in their interest. This can actually improve their bottom line.And it wasn't just the usual suspects. I have to tell you I had the CEO of a major, major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say \u2014 privately, of course \u2014 he did not know how he was going to change his company, but he is going to change it, because he's interested in long-term viability. Well, now we have a shift in the economic equation, and with that, with broader support from everyone, it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest. And when we asked countries to begin to identify how they could contribute to global efforts but based on their national interest, 189 countries out of 195, 189 countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans, based on their national interest, concurrent with their priorities, consistent with their national sustainable development plans.Well, once you protect the core interests of nations, then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a common path, onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades, but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy, into a decarbonized, highly resilient economy, And the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate, but they are only the first step, and they will improve over time. And the measurement, reporting and verification of all of those efforts is legally binding. And the checkpoints that we're going to have every five years to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding, and the path itself toward a decarbonized and more resilient economy is legally binding.And here's the more important part: What did we have before? A very small handful of countries who had undertaken very reduced, short-term emission reduction commitments that were completely insufficient and furthermore, largely perceived as a burden. Now what do we have? Now we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors, but all of them contributing to a common goal and along a path with environmental integrity. Well, once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding, then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement.(Applause)So, as I look back over the past six years, first I remember the day the Paris agreement was adopted. I cannot tell you the euphoria in the room. 5,000 people jumping out of their seats, crying, clapping, screaming, yelling, torn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen, because so many people had worked for years towards this, and this was finally their reality.And it wasn't just those who had participated directly. A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague who was trying to decide on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife Natasha. And once he had finally decided what he was going to buy, the jeweler said to him, \"You know, you're very lucky that you're buying this now, because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change.\" \"But,\" the jeweler said, \"have you heard, the governments have just come to a decision, and Tahiti could have a chance.\" Well, what a fantastic confirmation that perhaps, perhaps here is hope, here is a possible chance. I'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do. We've only just started our work on climate change. And in fact, we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts over the next five years that are the urgent five years. But I do believe that we have come over the past six years from the impossible to the now unstoppable. And how did we do that? By injecting transformational optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration, that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global needs, and that if we understand that, we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously.And as I look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century \u2014 food security, water security, home security, forced migration \u2014 I see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet. But we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change and we can understand that we have got to reinterpret the zero-sum mentality. Because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers, and that your loss is my gain. Well, now that we're in a world in which we have reached planetary boundaries and that we are not just so interconnected, but increasingly interdependent on each other, your loss is no longer my gain. We're either all losers or we all can be winners. But we are going to have to decide between zero and sum. We're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all or living life as the sum of all of us. We've done it once. We can do it again.Thanks.(Applause)", "id": 2480, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:15.374\nI have one more reason for optimism:\n\n00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:16.854\nclimate change.\n\n00:00:16.878 --> 00:00:19.638\nMaybe you don't believe it,\nbut here is the fact.\n\n00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:23.758\nOn December 12, 2015,\n\n00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:27.174\nin Paris, under the United Nations,\n\n00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:31.654\n195 governments got together\n\n00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:33.838\nand unanimously --\n\n00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.774\nif you've worked with governments,\nyou know how difficult that is --\n\n00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:40.014\nunanimously decided\n\n00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:44.854\nto intentionally change the course\nof the global economy\n\n00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.694\nin order to protect the most vulnerable\n\n00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:50.374\nand improve the life of all of us.\n\n00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:52.814\nNow, that is a remarkable achievement.\n\n00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:55.054\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:57.214\nBut it is even more remarkable\n\n00:00:57.238 --> 00:01:01.214\nif you consider where we had been\njust a few years ago.\n\n00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:03.894\n2009, Copenhagen.\n\n00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.558\nWho remembers Copenhagen?\n\n00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:11.694\nWell, after years of working\ntoward a climate agreement,\n\n00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:14.878\nthe same governments\nconvened in Copenhagen\n\n00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:17.998\nand failed miserably.\n\n00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:20.974\nWhy did it fail miserably?\n\n00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:22.574\nFor many different reasons,\n\n00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:26.134\nbut primarily because\nof the deeply entrenched divide\n\n00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:28.878\nbetween the global\nNorth and the global South.\n\n00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:34.574\nSo now, six months after this failure,\n\n00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:37.934\nI was called in\nto assume the responsibility\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.014\nof the global climate change negotiations.\n\n00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:44.414\nYou can imagine, the perfect moment\nto start this new job.\n\n00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:48.134\nThe global mood on climate change\nwas in the trash can.\n\n00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:50.614\nNo one believed\n\n00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:53.598\nthat a global agreement\ncould ever be possible.\n\n00:01:54.118 --> 00:01:56.158\nIn fact, neither did I.\n\n00:01:57.118 --> 00:02:01.934\nIf you promise not to tell anyone\noutside of this wonderful TED audience,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.054\nI'm going to divulge a secret\n\n00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:08.438\nthat has been gratefully\nburied by history.\n\n00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:12.254\nOn my first press conference,\n\n00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:15.654\na journalist asked, \"Um, Ms. Figueres,\n\n00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:20.054\ndo you think that a global agreement\nis ever going to be possible?\"\n\n00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:24.414\nAnd without engaging brain,\nI heard me utter,\n\n00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:26.038\n\"Not in my lifetime.\"\n\n00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:30.734\nWell, you can imagine\nthe faces of my press team\n\n00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:34.454\nwho were horrified\nat this crazy Costa Rican woman\n\n00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:35.878\nwho was their new boss.\n\n00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:39.294\nAnd I was horrified, too.\n\n00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:42.574\nNow, I wasn't horrified at me,\nbecause I'm kind of used to myself.\n\n00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:44.774\nI was actually horrified\n\n00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:48.494\nat the consequences\nof what I had just said,\n\n00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:50.694\nat the consequences for the world\n\n00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:55.118\nin which all our children\nare going to have to live.\n\n00:02:56.198 --> 00:02:59.014\nIt was frankly a horrible moment for me,\n\n00:02:59.038 --> 00:03:01.134\nand I thought, well, no, hang on,\n\n00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:02.774\nhang on.\n\n00:03:02.798 --> 00:03:06.614\nImpossible is not a fact,\n\n00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:08.078\nit's an attitude.\n\n00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:11.134\nIt's only an attitude.\n\n00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:16.094\nAnd I decided right then and there\nthat I was going to change my attitude\n\n00:03:16.118 --> 00:03:20.758\nand I was going to help the world\nchange its attitude on climate change.\n\n00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:24.694\nSo I don't know --\n\n00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:26.694\nNo, just this?

00:04:51.078\nand can help each other\nto better the fate of mankind.\n\n00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:54.374\nWell, you can imagine\nthat I thought that without that,\n\n00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:57.854\nthere was no way we were going\nto get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.\n\n00:04:57.878 --> 00:04:59.694\nAnd for six years,\n\n00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:05.574\nI have stubbornly, relentlessly\ninjected optimism into the system,\n\n00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:08.454\nno matter what the questions\nfrom the press --\n\n00:05:08.478 --> 00:05:10.654\nand I have gotten better at those --\n\n00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:13.854\nand no matter what the evidence\nto the contrary.\n\n00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:19.358\nAnd believe you me, there has been\na lot of contrary evidence.\n\n00:05:21.318 --> 00:05:25.598\nBut relentless optimism into the system.\n\n00:05:26.838 --> 00:05:28.814\nAnd pretty soon,\n\n00:05:28.838 --> 00:05:34.174\nwe began to see changes\nhappening in many areas,\n\n00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:37.454\nprecipitated by thousands of people,\n\n00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:40.094\nincluding many of you here today,\n\n00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:41.318\nand I thank you.\n\n00:05:41.998 --> 00:05:47.094\nAnd this TED community\nwill not be surprised\n\n00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:49.734\nif I tell you the first area\n\n00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:52.894\nin which we saw remarkable change\n\n00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:54.118\nwas ...\n\n00:05:55.278 --> 00:05:56.478\ntechnology.\n\n00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:00.174\nWe began to see that clean technologies,\n\n00:06:00.198 --> 00:06:02.654\nin particular renewable\nenergy technologies,\n\n00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:05.294\nbegan to drop price\nand increase in capacity,\n\n00:06:05.318 --> 00:06:08.374\nto the point where today\nwe are already building\n\n00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:10.134\nconcentrated solar power plants\n\n00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:14.614\nthat have the capacity\nto power entire cities,\n\n00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:18.774\nto say nothing of the fact\nof what we are doing on mobility\n\n00:06:18.798 --> 00:06:20.678\nand intelligent buildings.\n\n00:06:21.358 --> 00:06:24.174\nAnd with this shift in technologies,\n\n00:06:24.198 --> 00:06:27.374\nwe were able to begin to understand\n\n00:06:27.398 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat there was a shift\nin the economic equation,\n\n00:06:31.678 --> 00:06:33.774\nbecause we were able to recognize\n\n00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:36.894\nthat yes, there are\nhuge costs to climate change,\n\n00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:39.454\nand yes, there are compounded risks.\n\n00:06:39.478 --> 00:06:42.134\nBut there also are economic advantages\n\n00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:43.854\nand intrinsic benefits,\n\n00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:46.814\nbecause the dissemination\nof the clean technologies\n\n00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:48.838\nis going to bring us cleaner air,\n\n00:06:50.598 --> 00:06:51.974\nbetter health,\n\n00:06:51.998 --> 00:06:54.534\nbetter transportation,\nmore livable cities,\n\n00:06:54.558 --> 00:06:56.094\nmore energy security,\n\n00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:59.574\nmore energy access\nto the developing world.\n\n00:06:59.598 --> 00:07:02.638\nIn sum, a better world\nthan what we have now.\n\n00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.478\nAnd with that understanding,\n\n00:07:06.798 --> 00:07:10.294\nyou should have witnessed,\nin fact, part of you were,\n\n00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:14.654\nthe spread of ingenuity and excitement\n\n00:07:14.678 --> 00:07:18.694\nthat went through,\nfirst through nonnational governments,\n\n00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:22.854\nthe private sector, captains of industry,\ninsurance companies,\n\n00:07:22.878 --> 00:07:27.174\ninvestors, city leaders,\nfaith communities,\n\n00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:32.534\nbecause they all began to understand,\nthis actually can be in their interest.\n\n00:07:32.558 --> 00:07:36.078\nThis can actually\nimprove their bottom line.\n\n00:07:37.798 --> 00:07:43.558\nAnd it wasn't just the usual suspects.\n\n00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:50.014\nI have to tell you I had the CEO\nof a major, major oil and gas company\n\n00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:52.374\ncome to me at the beginning of last year\n\n00:07:52.398 --> 00:07:53.598\nand say --\n\n00:07:54.478 --> 00:07:56.238\nprivately, of course --\n\n00:07:57.238 --> 00:08:01.094\nhe did not know how\nhe was going to change his company,\n\n00:08:01.118 --> 00:08:03.294\nbut he is going to change it,\n\n00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:05.998\nbecause he's interested\nin long-term viability.\n\n00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:11.974\nWell, now we have a shift\nin the economic equation,\n\n00:08:11.998 --> 00:08:16.334\nand with that, with broader\nsupport from everyone,\n\n00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:22.734\nit did not take very long\nbefore we saw that national governments\n\n00:08:22.758 --> 00:08:27.614\nwoke up to the fact\nthat this is in their national interest.\n\n00:08:27.638 --> 00:08:31.774\nAnd when we asked countries\nto begin to identify\n\n00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:35.694\nhow they could contribute\nto global efforts\n\n00:08:35.718 --> 00:08:38.054\nbut based on their national interest,\n\n00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:42.334\n189 countries out of 195,\n\n00:08:42.358 --> 00:08:47.694\n189 countries sent their\ncomprehensive climate change plans,\n\n00:08:47.718 --> 00:08:49.853\nbased on their national interest,\n\n00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:51.774\nconcurrent with their priorities,\n\n00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:55.278\nconsistent with their national\nsustainable development plans.\n\n00:08:56.638 --> 00:08:57.838\nWell,\n\n00:08:58.758 --> 00:09:03.934\nonce you protect\nthe core interests of nations,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.614\nthen you can understand\nthat nations were ready\n\n00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:11.254\nto begin to converge onto a common path,\n\n00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:14.534\nonto a common direction of travel\n\n00:09:14.558 --> 00:09:17.694\nthat is going to take us\nprobably several decades,\n\n00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:20.214\nbut over those several decades\nis going to take us\n\n00:09:20.238 --> 00:09:21.694\ninto the new economy,\n\n00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:25.294\ninto a decarbonized,\nhighly resilient economy,\n\n00:09:25.318 --> 00:09:28.694\nAnd the national contributions\nthat are currently on the table\n\n00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:31.014\non behalf of national governments\n\n00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:35.174\nare insufficient to get us\nto a stabilized climate,\n\n00:09:35.198 --> 00:09:37.254\nbut they are only the first step,\n\n00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:39.294\nand they will improve over time.\n\n00:09:39.318 --> 00:09:43.734\nAnd the measurement, reporting\nand verification of all of those efforts\n\n00:09:43.758 --> 00:09:45.414\nis legally binding.\n\n00:09:45.438 --> 00:09:49.174\nAnd the checkpoints that we're\ngoing to have every five years\n\n00:09:49.198 --> 00:09:53.694\nto assess collective progress\ntowards our goal are legally binding,\n\n00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:58.614\nand the path itself toward\na decarbonized and more resilient economy\n\n00:09:58.638 --> 00:09:59.838\nis legally binding.\n\n00:10:00.438 --> 00:10:02.454\nAnd here's the more important part:\n\n00:10:02.478 --> 00:10:03.894\nWhat did we have before?\n\n00:10:03.918 --> 00:10:06.974\nA very small handful of countries\n\n00:10:06.998 --> 00:10:10.238\nwho had undertaken very reduced,\n\n00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:14.334\nshort-term emission reduction commitments\n\n00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:17.534\nthat were completely insufficient\n\n00:10:17.558 --> 00:10:20.974\nand furthermore,\nlargely perceived as a burden.\n\n00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:22.414\nNow what do we have?\n\n00:10:22.438 --> 00:10:28.014\nNow we have all countries of the world\ncontributing with different intensities\n\n00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:30.334\nfrom different approaches\nin different sectors,\n\n00:10:30.358 --> 00:10:33.838\nbut all of them\ncontributing to a common goal\n\n00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:37.454\nand along a path\n\n00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:39.518\nwith environmental integrity.\n\n00:10:40.358 --> 00:10:44.414\nWell, once you have all of this in place\n\n00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:46.654\nand you have shifted this understanding,\n\n00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:51.054\nthen you see that governments\nwere able to go to Paris\n\n00:10:51.078 --> 00:10:53.614\nand adopt the Paris agreement.\n\n00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:56.278\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:01.318 --> 00:11:02.518\nSo,\n\n00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:04.758\nas I look back\n\n00:11:08.398 --> 00:11:10.518\nover the past six years,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.438\nfirst I remember\n\n00:11:16.438 --> 00:11:20.038\nthe day the Paris agreement was adopted.\n\n00:11:20.758 --> 00:11:23.334\nI cannot tell you\nthe euphoria in the room.\n\n00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:26.734\n5,000 people jumping out of their seats,\n\n00:11:26.758 --> 00:11:30.414\ncrying, clapping, screaming, yelling,\n\n00:11:30.438 --> 00:11:35.734\ntorn between euphoria and still disbelief\nat what they had just seen,\n\n00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:37.598\nbecause so many people\n\n00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:43.078\nhad worked for years towards this,\nand this was finally their reality.\n\n00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:48.678\nAnd it wasn't just those\nwho had participated directly.\n\n00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:52.334\nA few weeks ago, I was with a colleague\n\n00:11:52.358 --> 00:11:54.174\nwho was trying to decide\n\n00:11:54.198 --> 00:11:59.398\non a Tahitian pearl that he wanted\nto give to his wonderful wife Natasha.\n\n00:12:01.118 --> 00:12:05.158\nAnd once he had finally decided\nwhat he was going to buy,\n\n00:12:06.718 --> 00:12:07.934\nthe jeweler said to him,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.774\n\"You know, you're very lucky\nthat you're buying this now,\n\n00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:15.478\nbecause these pearls could go extinct\nvery soon because of climate change.\"\n\n00:12:16.198 --> 00:12:19.734\n\"But,\" the jeweler said, \"have you heard,\n\n00:12:19.758 --> 00:12:22.534\nthe governments\nhave just come to a decision,\n\n00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:25.798\nand Tahiti could have a chance.\"\n\n00:12:26.758 --> 00:12:29.974\nWell, what a fantastic confirmation\n\n00:12:29.998 --> 00:12:34.014\nthat perhaps, perhaps here is hope,\n\n00:12:34.038 --> 00:12:36.038\nhere is a possible chance.\n\n00:12:37.598 --> 00:12:42.254\nI'm the first one to recognize\nthat we have a lot of work still to do.\n\n00:12:42.278 --> 00:12:45.614\nWe've only just started\nour work on climate change.\n\n00:12:45.638 --> 00:12:49.334\nAnd in fact, we need to make sure\nthat we redouble our efforts\n\n00:12:49.358 --> 00:12:53.158\nover the next five years\nthat are the urgent five years.\n\n00:12:54.598 --> 00:12:57.454\nBut I do believe\n\n00:12:57.478 --> 00:13:00.414\nthat we have come over the past six years\n\n00:13:00.438 --> 00:13:01.638\nfrom the impossible\n\n00:13:02.398 --> 00:13:04.494\nto the now unstoppable.\n\n00:13:04.518 --> 00:13:09.574\nAnd how did we do that?\nBy injecting transformational optimism\n\n00:13:09.598 --> 00:13:13.054\nthat allowed us to go\nfrom confrontation to collaboration,\n\n00:13:13.078 --> 00:13:16.374\nthat allowed us to understand\nthat national and local interests\n\n00:13:16.398 --> 00:13:19.774\nare not necessarily at odds\nwith global needs,\n\n00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.513\nand that if we understand that,\nwe can bring them together\n\n00:13:22.537 --> 00:13:24.774\nand we can merge them harmoniously.\n\n00:13:24.798 --> 00:13:28.534\nAnd as I look forward\nto other global issues\n\n00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:32.414\nthat will require\nour attention this century --\n\n00:13:32.438 --> 00:13:36.918\nfood security, water security,\nhome security, forced migration --\n\n00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:41.454\nI see that we certainly do not know\n\n00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:45.014\nhow we are going to solve\nthose problems yet.\n\n00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:49.734\nBut we can take a page\nout of what we have done on climate change\n\n00:13:49.758 --> 00:13:51.014\nand we can understand\n\n00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:57.334\nthat we have got to reinterpret\nthe zero-sum mentality.\n\n00:13:57.358 --> 00:14:02.334\nBecause we were trained to believe\nthat there always are winners and losers,\n\n00:14:02.358 --> 00:14:03.998\nand that your loss is my gain.\n\n00:14:04.598 --> 00:14:06.694\nWell, now that we're in a world\n\n00:14:06.718 --> 00:14:09.654\nin which we have reached\nplanetary boundaries\n\n00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:12.334\nand that we are not\njust so interconnected,\n\n00:14:12.358 --> 00:14:15.774\nbut increasingly\ninterdependent on each other,\n\n00:14:15.798 --> 00:14:17.958\nyour loss is no longer my gain.\n\n00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:21.198\nWe're either all losers\n\n00:14:22.118 --> 00:14:24.854\nor we all can be winners.\n\n00:14:24.878 --> 00:14:27.174\nBut we are going to have to decide\n\n00:14:27.198 --> 00:14:30.358\nbetween zero and sum.\n\n00:14:30.998 --> 00:14:35.854\nWe're going to have to decide\nbetween zero benefit for all\n\n00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:39.854\nor living life as the sum of all of us.\n\n00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:42.214\nWe've done it once. We can do it again.\n\n00:14:42.238 --> 00:14:43.454\nThanks.\n\n00:14:43.478 --> 00:14:48.906\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "TED's secret to great public speaking", "duration": "475", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_teds_secret_to_great_public_speaking", "transcript": "Some people think that there's a TED Talk formula:\"Give a talk on a round, red rug.\"\"Share a childhood story.\"\"Divulge a personal secret.\"\"End with an inspiring call to action.\"No. That's not how to think of a TED Talk. In fact, if you overuse those devices, you're just going to come across as clich\u00e9d or emotionally manipulative.But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common, and I would like to share that thing with you,because over the past 12 years, I've had a ringside seat, listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers, like these. I've helped them prepare their talks for prime time, and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk.And even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different, they actually do have one key common ingredient. And it's this: Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners' minds an extraordinary gift \u2014 a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea.Let me show you what I mean. Here's Haley. She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly, she's terrified.(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!(Applause)Over the course of 18 minutes, 1,200 people, many of whom have never seen each other before, are finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley's brain and with each other. They're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns. And I don't just mean they're feeling the same emotions. There's something even more startling happening.Let's take a look inside Haley's brain for a moment. There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle. But look here, right here \u2014 a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea. And incredibly, this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening. That's right; in just a few minutes, a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds, just by people listening to a voice and watching a face.But wait \u2014 what is an idea anyway? Well, you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world. Ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic.Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage. Sir Ken Robinson \u2014 creativity is key to our kids' future.(Video) Sir Ken Robinson: My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy \u2014 building from bamboo is beautiful.(Video) Elora Hardy: It is growing all around us, it's strong, it's elegant, it's earthquake-resistant.CA: Chimamanda Adichie \u2014 people are more than a single identity.(Video) Chimamanda Adichie: The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas, and not just randomly. They're carefully linked together. Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview. It's your brain's operating system. It's how you navigate the world. And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas.So, for example, if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable, then when you see this, you'll react like this. But if another component of your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous, then when you see this, you'll react a little bit differently. So, it's pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial. You need them to be as reliable as possible \u2014 a guide, to the scary but wonderful real world out there.Now, different people's worldviews can be dramatically different. For example, how does your worldview react when you see this image:(Video) Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me? \"A woman of faith,\" \"an expert,\" maybe even \"a sister\"? Or \"oppressed,\" \"brainwashed,\" \"a terrorist\"?CA: Whatever your answer, there are millions of people out there who would react very differently. So that's why ideas really matter. If communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever, how someone thinks about the world, and shaping their actions both now and well into the future. Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture.So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience, here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task:One, limit your talk to just one major idea. Ideas are complex things; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you're most passionate about, and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly. You have to give context, share examples, make it vivid. So pick one idea, and make it the through-line running through your entire talk, so that everything you say links back to it in some way.Two, give your listeners a reason to care. Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience, you have to get their permission to welcome you in. And the main tool to achieve that? Curiosity. Stir your audience's curiosity. Use intriguing, provocative questions to identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining. If you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview, they'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap. And once you've sparked that desire, it will be so much easier to start building your idea.Three, build your idea, piece by piece, out of concepts that your audience already understands. You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners' minds \u2014 but not your language, their language. You start where they are. The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences. Now, metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together, because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern, based on an idea that the listener already understands.For example, when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR, she said, \"It's as if, for the first time, you had a word processor to edit DNA. CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily.\" Now, a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds. It's important, therefore, to test your talk on trusted friends, and find out which parts they get confused by.Four, here's the final tip: Make your idea worth sharing. By that I mean, ask yourself the question: \"Who does this idea benefit?\" And I need you to be honest with the answer. If the idea only serves you or your organization, then, I'm sorry to say, it's probably not worth sharing. The audience will see right through you. But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently, then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk, one that can be a gift to them and to all of us.", "id": 2485, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.216 -->

00:01:20.492\nShe is about to give a TED Talk\n\n00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:22.359\nand frankly, she's terrified.\n\n00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:24.032\n(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!\n\n00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:27.056\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:32.331\nOver the course of 18 minutes,\n\n00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:36.319\n1,200 people, many of whom\nhave never seen each other before,\n\n00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:40.463\nare finding that their brains\nare starting to sync with Haley's brain\n\n00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:41.925\nand with each other.\n\n00:01:41.949 -->

00:01:50.756\nThere's something even more\nstartling happening.\n\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.677\nLet's take a look inside\nHaley's brain for a moment.\n\n00:01:54.148 --> 00:01:58.379\nThere are billions of interconnected\nneurons in an impossible tangle.\n\n00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:00.210\nBut look here, right here --\n\n00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:02.995\na few million of them\nare linked to each other\n\n00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.458\nin a way which represents a single idea.\n\n00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:10.522\nAnd incredibly, this exact pattern\nis being recreated in real time\n\n00:02:10.546

00:02:27.449\nBut wait -- what is an idea anyway?\n\n00:02:27.473 --> 00:02:30.957\nWell, you can think of it\nas a pattern of information\n\n00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:34.369\nthat helps you understand\nand navigate the world.\n\n00:02:34.393 --> 00:02:36.369\nIdeas come in all shapes and sizes,\n\n00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:38.393\nfrom the complex and analytical\n\n00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:40.496\nto the simple and aesthetic.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.393\nHere are just a few examples\nshared from the TED stage.\n\n00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:47.479\nSir Ken Robinson -- creativity\nis key to our kids' future.\n\n00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:50.434\n(Video) Sir Ken Robinson:\nMy contention is that creativity now\n\n00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:53.559\nis as important in education as literacy,\n\n00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.073\nand we should treat it\nwith the same status.\n\n00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:59.217\nChris Anderson: Elora Hardy --\nbuilding from bamboo is beautiful.\n\n00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:01.565\n(Video) Elora Hardy:\nIt is growing all around us,\n\n00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.749\nit's strong, it's elegant,\nit's earthquake-resistant.\n\n00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:09.614\nCA: Chimamanda Adichie --\npeople are more than a single identity.\n\n00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:12.740\n(Video) Chimamanda Adichie:\nThe single story creates stereotypes,\n\n00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:17.161\nand the problem with stereotypes\nis not that they are untrue,\n\n00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:19.169\nbut that they are incomplete.\n\n00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.779\nCA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,\n\n00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:23.154\nand not just randomly.\n\n00:03:23.178 --> 00:03:25.384\nThey're carefully linked together.\n\n00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:28.313\nCollectively they form\nan amazingly complex structure\n\n00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:30.511\nthat is your personal worldview.\n\n00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:32.821\nIt's your brain's operating system.\n\n00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.717\nIt's how you navigate the world.\n\n00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:38.526\nAnd it is built up out of millions\nof individual ideas.\n\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.019\nSo, for example, if one little\ncomponent of your worldview\n\n00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:44.869\nis the idea that kittens are adorable,\n\n00:03:44.893 --> 00:03:47.288\nthen when you see this,\n\n00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:48.892\nyou'll react like this.\n\n00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:50.993\nBut if another component of your worldview\n\n00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:53.280\nis the idea that leopards are dangerous,\n\n00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:54.549\nthen when you see this,\n\n00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:56.834\nyou'll react a little bit differently.\n\n00:03:57.482 --> 00:03:59.070\nSo, it's pretty obvious\n\n00:03:59.094 --> 00:04:03.007\nwhy the ideas that make up\nyour worldview are crucial.\n\n00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:06.027\nYou need them to be as reliable\nas possible -- a guide,\n\n00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:09.839\nto the scary but wonderful\nreal world out there.\n\n00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:13.610\nNow, different people's worldviews\ncan be dramatically different.\n\n00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:15.342\nFor example,\n\n00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:19.204\nhow does your worldview react\nwhen you see this image:\n\n00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:22.845\n(Video) Dalia Mogahed:\nWhat do you think when you look at me?\n\n00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:27.311\n\"A woman of faith,\"\n\"an expert,\" maybe even \"a sister\"?\n\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.069\nOr \"oppressed,\" \"brainwashed,\"\n\n00:04:32.093 --> 00:04:33.258\n\"a terrorist\"?\n\n00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:35.307\nCA: Whatever your answer,\n\n00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:38.728\nthere are millions of people out there\nwho would react very differently.\n\n00:04:38.752 --> 00:04:40.828\nSo that's why ideas really matter.\n\n00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:44.530\nIf communicated properly,\nthey're capable of changing, forever,\n\n00:04:44.554 --> 00:04:46.603\nhow someone thinks about the world,\n\n00:04:46.627 --> 00:04:51.012\nand shaping their actions both now\nand well into the future.\n\n00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:55.442\nIdeas are the most powerful force\nshaping human culture.\n\n00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:56.617\nSo if you accept\n\n00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:59.371\nthat your number one task\nas a speaker is to build an idea\n\n00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:01.441\ninside the minds of your audience,\n\n00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:04.759\nhere are four guidelines\nfor how you should go about that task:\n\n00:05:04.783

year of fulfillment, realization. I have that sense, not because of anything particular in store for me, but because I read it would be a good year in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.\"He felt his own age, forty-four ...\" wrote Mailer in \"The Armies of the Night,\" \"... felt as if he were a solid embodiment of bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to be a man, as if he had arrived.\"Yes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me. But I also know that he was; for all of us \u2014 you, me, the subject of his book, age more or less in step, proceed from birth along the same great sequence: through the wonders and confinements of childhood; the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence; the empowerments and millstones of adulthood; the recognitions and resignations of old age. There are patterns to life, and they are shared. As Thomas Mann wrote: \"It will happen to me as to them.\"We don't simply live these patterns. We record them, too. We write them down in books, where they become narratives that we can then read and recognize. Books tell us who we've been, who we are, who we will be, too. So they have for millennia. As James Salter wrote, \"Life passes into pages if it passes into anything.\"And so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind: if life passed into pages, there were, somewhere, passages written about every age. If I could find them, I could assemble them into a narrative. I could assemble them into a life, a long life, a hundred-year life, the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass. I was then 37 years old, \"an age of discretion,\" wrote William Trevor. I was prone to meditating on time and age. An illness in the family and later an injury to me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed. And besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable, time seeing through what circumstance did not. It was all a bit disheartening.A list, though, would last. To chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting, would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future, whether we made it there or not. And when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed, searching pages and pages for ages and ages. Here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years. \"Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations,\" \"sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments.\"I was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative. For starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly. Christopher Isherwood used the phrase \"the yellow leaf\" to describe a man at 53, only one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at 36.(Laughter)I was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the next, and that people may experience the same age differently. But even so, as the list coalesced, so, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror, did the life that I had been living: finding at 20 that \"... one is less and less sure of who one is;\" emerging at 30 from the \"... wasteland of preparation into active life;\" learning at 40 \"... to close softly the doors to rooms [I would] not be coming back to.\" There I was.Of course, there we all are. Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer whose beautiful visualizations you see here, and who today is 85 \u2014 all those years \"... a ripening and an apotheosis,\" wrote Nabokov \u2014 noted to me that, like art and like color, literature helps us to remember what we've experienced.And indeed, when I shared the list with my grandfather, he nodded in recognition. He was then 95 and soon to die, which, wrote Roberto Bola\u00f1o, \"... is the same as never dying.\" And looking back, he said to me that, yes, Proust was right that at 22, we are sure we will not die, just as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right that at 90, we are sure we will. It had happened to him, as to them.Now the list is done: a hundred years. And looking back over it, I know that I am not done. I still have my life to live, still have many more pages to pass into. And mindful of Mailer, I await 44.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2482, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.732 --> 00:00:15.124\nI'm turning 44 next

How to do it wisely", "duration": "889", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/juan_enriquez_we_can_reprogram_life_how_to_do_it_wisely", "transcript": "So, there's an actor called Dustin Hoffman. And years ago, he made this movie which some of you may have heard of, called \"The Graduate.\" And there's two key scenes in that movie. The first one is the seduction scene. I'm not going to talk about that tonight.(Laughter)The second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool, and as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word, just one word. And of course, all of you know what that word is. It's \"plastics.\"(Laughter)And the only problem with that is, it was completely the wrong advice.(Laughter)Let me tell you why it was so wrong. The word should have been \"silicon.\" And the reason it should have been silicon is because the basic patents for semiconductors had already been made, had already been filed, and they were already building them. So Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967, when this movie was released. And the year after the movie was released, Intel was founded. So had the graduate heard the right one word, maybe he would have ended up onstage \u2014 oh, I don't know \u2014 maybe with these two.(Laughter)So as you're thinking of that, let's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate doesn't become a Tupperware salesman.(Laughter)So in 2015, what word of advice would you give people, when you took a college graduate out by the pool and you said one word, just one word? I think the answer would be \"lifecode.\" So what is \"lifecode?\" Lifecode is the various ways we have of programming life. So instead of programming computers, we're using things to program viruses or retroviruses or proteins or DNA or RNA or plants or animals, or a whole series of creatures. And as you're thinking about this incredible ability to make life do what you want it to do, what it's programmed to do, what you end up doing is taking what we've been doing for thousands of years, which is breeding, changing, mixing, matching all kinds of life-forms, and we accelerate it.And this is not something new. This humble mustard weed has been modified so that if you change it in one way, you get broccoli. And if you change it in a second way, you get kale. And if you change it in a third way, you get cauliflower. So when you go to these all-natural, organic markets, you're really going to a place where people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time. The difference today, to pick a completely politically neutral term \u2014[Intelligent design](Laughter)We're beginning to practice intelligent design. That means that instead of doing this at random and seeing what happens over generations, we're inserting specific genes, we're inserting specific proteins, and we're changing lifecode for very deliberate purposes. And that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens.Let me just give you one example. Some of you occasionally might think about sex. And we kind of take it for granted how we've changed sex. So we think it's perfectly normal and natural to change it. What's happened with sex over time is \u2014 normally, sex equals baby, eventually. But in today's world, sex plus pill equals no baby.(Laughter)And again, we think that's perfectly normal and natural, but that has not been the case for most of human history. And it's not the case for animals. What it is does is it gives us control, so sex becomes separate from conception. And as you're thinking of the consequences of that, then we've been playing with stuff that's a little bit more advanced, like art. Not in the sense of painting and sculpture, but in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies. So what are assisted reproductive technologies? Assisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization. And when you do in vitro fertilization, there's very good reasons to do it. Sometimes you just can't conceive otherwise. But when you do that, what you\u2019re doing is separating sex, conception, baby. So you haven't just taken control of when you have a baby, you've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized. So you've separated the baby from the body from the act. And as you're thinking of other things we've been doing, think about twins. So you can freeze sperm, you can freeze eggs, you can freeze fertilized eggs. And what does that mean? Well, that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient. You're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation, so you save these things. You don't irradiate them. But if you can save them and you can freeze them, and you can have a surrogate mother, it means that you've decoupled sex from time. It means you can have twins born \u2014 oh, in 50 years?(Laughter)In a hundred years? Two hundred years? And these are three really profound changes that are not, like, future stuff. This is stuff we take for granted today.So this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower. It turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses, of changing plants, of changing animals, perhaps even of evolving ourselves. It's something that Steve Gullans and I have been thinking about for a while.Let's have some risks. Like every powerful technology, like electricity, like an automobile, like computers, this stuff potentially can be misused. And that scares a lot of people. And as you apply these technologies, you can even turn human beings into chimeras. Remember the Greek myth where you mix animals? Well, some of these treatments actually end up changing your blood type. Or they'll put male cells in a female body or vice versa, which sounds absolutely horrible until you realize, the reason you're doing that is you're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments. So by taking somebody else's bone marrow, you may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself, but you're also saving your life. And as you're thinking about this stuff, here's something that happened 20 years ago.This is Emma Ott. She's a recent college admittee. She's studying accounting. She played two varsity sports. She graduated as a valedictorian. And that's not particularly extraordinary, except that she's the first human being born to three parents. Why? Because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease that she might have inherited. So when you swap out a third person's DNA and you put it in there, you save the lives of people. But you also are doing germline engineering, which means her kids, if she has kids, will be saved and won't go through this. And [their] kids will be saved, and their grandchildren will be saved, and this passes on.That makes people nervous. So 20 years ago, the various authorities said, why don't we study this for a while? There are risks to doing stuff, and there are risks to not doing stuff, because there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology, and then we've been thinking about it for the next 20 years. So as we think about it, as we take the time to say, \"Hey, maybe we should have longer studies, maybe we should do this, maybe we should do that,\" there are consequences to acting, and there are consequences to not acting. Like curing deadly diseases \u2014 which, by the way, is completely unnatural. It is normal and natural for humans to be felled by massive epidemics of polio, of smallpox, of tuberculosis. When we put vaccines into people, we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit outweighs the risk. Because we've built unnatural plants, unnatural animals, we can feed about seven billion people. We can do things like create new life-forms. And as you create new life-forms, again, that sounds terribly scary and terribly bothersome, until you realize that those life-forms live on your dining room table. Those flowers you've got on your dining room table \u2014 there's not a lot that's natural about them, because people have been breeding the flowers to make this color, to be this size, to last for a week. You don't usually give your loved one wildflowers because they don't last a whole lot of time.What all this does is it flips Darwin completely on his head. See, for four billion years, what lived and died on this planet depended on two principles: on natural selection and random mutation. And so what lived and died, what was structured, has now been flipped on its head. And what we've done is created this completely parallel evolutionary system where we are practicing unnatural selection and non-random mutation.So let me explain these things. This is natural selection. This is unnatural selection.(Laughter)So what happens with this stuff is, we started breeding wolves thousands of years ago in central Asia to turn them into dogs. And then we started turning them into big dogs and into little dogs. But if you take one of the chihuahuas you see in the Herm\u00e8s bags on Fifth Avenue and you let it loose on the African plain, you can watch natural selection happen.(Laughter)Few things on Earth are less natural than a cornfield. You will never, under any scenario, walk through a virgin forest and see the same plant growing in orderly rows at the same time, nothing else living there. When you do a cornfield, you're selecting what lives and what dies. And you're doing that through unnatural selection. It's the same with a wheat field, it's the same with a rice field. It's the same with a city, it's the same with a suburb. In fact, half the surface of Earth has been unnaturally engineered so that what lives and what dies there is what we want, which is the reason why you don't have grizzly bears walking through downtown Manhattan.How about this random mutation stuff? Well, this is random mutation. This is Antonio Alfonseca. He's otherwise known as the Octopus, his nickname. He was the Relief Pitcher of the Year in 2000. And he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on each hand, which turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher.(Laughter)How about non-random mutation? A non-random mutation is beer. It's wine. It's yogurt. How many times have you walked through the forest and found all-natural cheese? Or all-natural yogurt? So we've been engineering this stuff. Now, the interesting thing is, we get to know the stuff better. We found one of the single most powerful gene-editing instruments, CRISPR, inside yogurt. And as we start engineering cells, we're producing eight out of the top 10 pharmaceutical products, including the stuff that you use to treat arthritis, which is the number one best-selling drug, Humira.So this lifecode stuff. It really is a superpower. It really is a way of programming stuff, and there's nothing that's going to change us more than this lifecode. So as you're thinking of lifecode, let's think of five principles as to how we start guiding, and I'd love you to give me more.So, principle number one: we have to take responsibility for this stuff. The reason we have to take responsibility is because we're in charge. These aren't random mutations. This is what we are doing, what we are choosing. It's not, \"Stuff happened.\" It didn't happen at random. It didn't come down by a verdict of somebody else. We engineer this stuff, and it's the Pottery Barn rule: you break it, you own it.Principle number two: we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff. There have been at least 33 versions of hominids that have walked around this Earth. Most all of them went extinct except us. But the normal and natural state of this Earth is we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time, which is why most of us have some Neanderthal in us. Some of us have some Denisova in us. And some in Washington have a lot more of it.(Laughter)Principle number three: we have to respect other people's choices. Some people will choose to never alter. Some people will choose to alter all. Some people will choose to alter plants but not animals. Some people will choose to alter themselves. Some people will choose to evolve themselves. Diversity is not a bad thing, because even though we think of humans as very diverse, we came so close to extinction that all of us descend from a single African mother and the consequence of that is there's more genetic diversity in 55 African chimpanzees than there are in seven billion humans.Principle number four: we should take about a quarter of the Earth and only let Darwin run the show there. It doesn't have to be contiguous, doesn't have to all be tied together. It should be part in the oceans, part on land. But we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet. We want to have our evolutionary system running. We want to have Darwin's evolutionary system running. And it's just really important to have these two things running in parallel and not overwhelm evolution.(Applause)Last thing I'll say. This is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on. This is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had. It would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff because you're scared of it, because you're hiding from it. You can participate in the ethics. You can participate in the politics. You can participate in the business. You can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going, where industry is going, where we're going to take the world. It would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool and says one word, just one word, if you don't listen if that word is \"lifecode.\"Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2473, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.100\nSo, there's an actor\ncalled Dustin Hoffman.\n\n00:00:16.243 --> 00:00:19.577\nAnd years ago, he made this movie\nwhich some of you may have heard of,\n\n00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:20.791\ncalled \"The Graduate.\"\n\n00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.832\nAnd there's two key scenes in that movie.\n\n00:00:24.517 --> 00:00:26.611\nThe first one is the seduction scene.\n\n00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:28.628\nI'm not going to talk about that tonight.\n\n00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:30.119\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:34.733\nThe second scene is where he's taken out\nby the old guy to the pool,\n\n00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:39.776\nand as a young college graduate,\nthe old guy basically says one word,\n\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.989\njust one word.\n\n00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:44.085\nAnd of course, all of you know\nwhat that word is.\n\n00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.299\nIt's \"plastics.\"\n\n00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:46.489\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:47.148 --> 00:00:51.080\nAnd the only problem with that is,\nit was completely the wrong advice.\n\n00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:52.591\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.335\nLet me tell you why it was so wrong.\n\n00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.152\nThe word should have been \"silicon.\"\n\n00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.145\nAnd the reason it should have been silicon\n\n00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:05.350\nis because the basic patents\nfor semiconductors had already been made,\n\n00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:06.751\nhad already been filed,\n\n00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.540\nand they were already building them.\n\n00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:11.651\nSo Silicon Valley was just\nbeing built in 1967,\n\n00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:13.483\nwhen this movie was released.\n\n00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.595\nAnd the year after the movie was released,\n\n00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.784\nIntel was founded.\n\n00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.111\nSo had the graduate heard\nthe right one word,\n\n00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:23.667\nmaybe he would have ended up\nonstage -- oh, I don't know --\n\n00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:24.849\nmaybe with these two.\n\n00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:27.752\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:31.913 --> 00:01:33.624\nSo as you're thinking of that,\n\n00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:38.022\nlet's see what bit of advice\nwe might want to give\n\n00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:41.636\nso that your next graduate doesn't become\na Tupperware salesman.\n\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.540\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:47.309\nSo in 2015, what word of advice\nwould you give people,\n\n00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.974\nwhen you took a college\ngraduate out by the pool\n\n00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:51.888\nand you said one word, just one word?\n\n00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:54.656\nI think the answer would be \"lifecode.\"\n\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.429\nSo what is \"lifecode?\"\n\n00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:59.190\nLifecode is the various ways\nwe have of programming life.\n\n00:01:59.214 --> 00:02:01.049\nSo instead of programming computers,\n\n00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:03.746\nwe're using things to program viruses\n\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.794\nor retroviruses or proteins\n\n00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:07.626\nor DNA or RNA\n\n00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.102\nor plants or animals,\nor a whole series of creatures.\n\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.120\nAnd as you're thinking\nabout this incredible ability\n\n00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:16.397\nto make life do what you want it to do,\n\n00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:18.538\nwhat it's programmed to do,\n\n00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:20.355\nwhat you end up doing\n\n00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.824\nis taking what we've been doing\nfor thousands of years,\n\n00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:26.969\nwhich is breeding, changing,\n\n00:02:26.993 --> 00:02:29.064\nmixing, matching\n\n00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:31.097\nall kinds of life-forms,\n\n00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:32.582\nand we accelerate it.\n\n00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:34.106\nAnd this is not something new.\n\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.430\nThis humble mustard weed has been modified\n\n00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:40.126\nso that if you change it in one way,\nyou get broccoli.\n\n00:02:40.672 --> 00:02:43.198\nAnd if you change it\nin a second way, you get kale.\n\n00:02:43.722 --> 00:02:45.738\nAnd if you change it in a third way,\n\n00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:47.031\nyou get cauliflower.\n\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.972\nSo when you go to these\nall-natural, organic markets,\n\n00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:52.576\nyou're really going to a place\n\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.559\nwhere people have been changing\nthe lifecode of plants for a long time.\n\n00:02:57.422 --> 00:02:58.586\nThe difference today,\n\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.855\nto pick a completely\npolitically neutral term --\n\n00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.570\n[Intelligent design]\n\n00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:03.751\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:06.181\nWe're beginning to practice\nintelligent design.\n\n00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:09.015\nThat means that instead\nof doing this at random\n\n00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.095\nand seeing what happens over generations,\n\n00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.805\nwe're inserting specific genes,\nwe're inserting specific proteins,\n\n00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.036\nand we're changing lifecode\nfor very deliberate purposes.\n\n00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:21.797\nAnd that allows us to accelerate\nhow this stuff happens.\n\n00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:24.169\nLet me just give you one example.\n\n00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:29.781\nSome of you occasionally\nmight think about sex.\n\n00:03:31.257 --> 00:03:34.486\nAnd we kind of take it for granted\nhow we've changed sex.\n\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.418\nSo we think it's perfectly normal\nand natural to change it.\n\n00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:40.257\nWhat's happened with sex over time is --\n\n00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:42.969\nnormally, sex equals baby, eventually.\n\n00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:45.439\nBut in today's world,\n\n00:03:45.463 --> 00:03:48.342\nsex plus pill equals no baby.\n\n00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:49.850\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:49.874 --> 00:03:52.612\nAnd again, we think\nthat's perfectly normal and natural,\n\n00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:55.486\nbut that has not been the case\nfor most of human history.\n\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.161\nAnd it's not the case for animals.\n\n00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.548\nWhat it is does is it gives us control,\n\n00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.011\nso sex becomes separate from conception.\n\n00:04:02.913 --> 00:04:05.358\nAnd as you're thinking\nof the consequences of that,\n\n00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:07.046\nthen we've been playing with stuff\n\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.381\nthat's a little bit more\nadvanced, like art.\n\n00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:11.483\nNot in the sense\nof painting and sculpture,\n\n00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:16.184\nbut in the sense of assisted\nreproductive technologies.\n\n00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:19.799\nSo what are assisted\nreproductive technologies?\n\n00:04:19.823 --> 00:04:23.541\nAssisted reproductive technologies\nare things like in vitro fertilization.\n\n00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:27.796\nAnd when you do in vitro fertilization,\nthere's very good reasons to do it.\n\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.940\nSometimes you just\ncan't conceive otherwise.\n\n00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.735\nBut when you do that,\n\n00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.821\nwhat you\u2019re doing is separating\nsex, conception, baby.\n\n00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:40.648\nSo you haven't just taken control\nof when you have a baby,\n\n00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:43.996\nyou've separated when the baby\nand where the baby is fertilized.\n\n00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:46.880\nSo you've separated the baby\n\n00:04:46.904 --> 00:04:48.609\nfrom the body from the act.\n\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.370\nAnd as you're thinking\nof other things we've been doing,\n\n00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:54.252\nthink about twins.\n\n00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:57.107\nSo you can freeze sperm,\nyou can freeze eggs,\n\n00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:58.828\nyou can freeze fertilized eggs.\n\n00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.501\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:04.019\nWell, that's a good thing\nif you're a cancer patient.\n\n00:05:04.043 --> 00:05:07.047\nYou're about to go under chemotherapy\nor under radiation,\n\n00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:08.301\nso you save these things.\n\n00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:09.562\nYou don't irradiate them.\n\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.356\nBut if you can save them\nand you can freeze them,\n\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.482\nand you can have a surrogate mother,\n\n00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:16.665\nit means that you've\ndecoupled sex from time.\n\n00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:22.586\nIt means you can have twins\nborn -- oh, in 50 years?\n\n00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:26.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.215\nIn a hundred years?\n\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.588\nTwo hundred years?\n\n00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:34.311\nAnd these are three\nreally profound changes\n\n00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:35.934\nthat are not, like, future stuff.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.075\nThis is stuff we take for granted today.\n\n00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:41.798\nSo this lifecode stuff\nturns out to be a superpower.\n\n00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:46.814\nIt turns out to be this incredibly\npowerful way of changing viruses,\n\n00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:49.022\nof changing plants, of changing animals,\n\n00:05:49.798 --> 00:05:52.052\nperhaps even of evolving ourselves.\n\n00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:55.818\nIt's something that Steve Gullans and I\nhave been thinking about for a while.\n\n00:05:56.707 --> 00:05:57.866\nLet's have some risks.\n\n00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:02.510\nLike every powerful technology,\nlike electricity, like an automobile,\n\n00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:05.843\nlike computers, this stuff\npotentially can be misused.\n\n00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.160\nAnd that scares a lot of people.\n\n00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:10.743\nAnd as you apply these technologies,\n\n00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:13.019\nyou can even turn human\nbeings into chimeras.\n\n00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.312\nRemember the Greek myth\nwhere you mix animals?\n\n00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:17.994\nWell, some of these treatments\n\n00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:20.592\nactually end up changing your blood type.\n\n00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:25.543\nOr they'll put male cells\nin a female body or vice versa,\n\n00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:27.872\nwhich sounds absolutely horrible\n\n00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:30.173\nuntil you realize, the reason\nyou're doing that\n\n00:06:30.197 --> 00:06:33.602\nis you're substituting bone marrow\nduring cancer treatments.\n\n00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.874\nSo by taking somebody else's bone marrow,\n\n00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:38.590\nyou may be changing\nsome fundamental aspects of yourself,\n\n00:06:38.614 --> 00:06:40.502\nbut you're also saving your life.\n\n00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:42.672\nAnd as you're thinking about this stuff,\n\n00:06:42.696 --> 00:06:44.866\nhere's something\nthat happened 20 years ago.\n\n00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:46.820\nThis is Emma Ott.\n\n00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:49.653\nShe's a recent college admittee.\n\n00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:51.582\nShe's studying accounting.\n\n00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:54.970\nShe played two varsity sports.\nShe graduated as a valedictorian.\n\n00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:57.665\nAnd that's not particularly extraordinary,\n\n00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.260\nexcept that she's the first human being\nborn to three parents.\n\n00:07:02.202 --> 00:07:03.353\nWhy?\n\n00:07:03.377 --> 00:07:05.543\nBecause she had a deadly\nmitochondrial disease\n\n00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:07.052\nthat she might have inherited.\n\n00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:09.457\nSo when you swap out a third person's DNA\n\n00:07:09.481 --> 00:07:11.209\nand you put it in there,\n\n00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:12.790\nyou save the lives of people.\n\n00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:16.179\nBut you also are doing\ngermline engineering,\n\n00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:20.346\nwhich means her kids,\nif she has kids, will be saved\n\n00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.780\nand won't go through this.\n\n00:07:21.804 --> 00:07:23.295\nAnd [their] kids will be saved,\n\n00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.154\nand their grandchildren will be saved,\n\n00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:26.375\nand this passes on.\n\n00:07:26.887 --> 00:07:28.512\nThat makes people nervous.\n\n00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:30.886\nSo 20 years ago,\nthe various authorities said,\n\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.829\nwhy don't we study this for a while?\n\n00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:37.675\nThere are risks to doing stuff,\nand there are risks to not doing stuff,\n\n00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:41.047\nbecause there were a couple dozen people\nsaved by this technology,\n\n00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:44.055\nand then we've been thinking about it\nfor the next 20 years.\n\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.143\nSo as we think about it,\n\n00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:49.977\nas we take the time to say, \"Hey,\nmaybe we should have longer studies,\n\n00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.402\nmaybe we should do this,\nmaybe we should do that,\"\n\n00:07:52.426 --> 00:07:56.235\nthere are consequences to acting,\nand there are consequences to not acting.\n\n00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:58.854\nLike curing deadly diseases --\n\n00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.884\nwhich, by the way,\nis completely unnatural.\n\n00:08:02.955 --> 00:08:06.037\nIt is normal and natural\nfor humans to be felled\n\n00:08:06.061 --> 00:08:10.130\nby massive epidemics of polio,\nof smallpox, of tuberculosis.\n\n00:08:10.154 --> 00:08:13.797\nWhen we put vaccines into people,\nwe are putting unnatural things\n\n00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:15.187\ninto their body\n\n00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:19.320\nbecause we think the benefit\noutweighs the risk.\n\n00:08:20.087 --> 00:08:23.800\nBecause we've built unnatural plants,\nunnatural animals,\n\n00:08:23.824 --> 00:08:25.997\nwe can feed about seven billion people.\n\n00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:29.543\nWe can do things\nlike create new life-forms.\n\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.777\nAnd as you create new life-forms,\nagain, that sounds terribly scary\n\n00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:35.482\nand terribly bothersome,\n\n00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:38.950\nuntil you realize that those life-forms\nlive on your dining room table.\n\n00:08:39.497 --> 00:08:41.994\nThose flowers you've got\non your dining room table --\n\n00:08:42.018 --> 00:08:44.187\nthere's not a lot\nthat's natural about them,\n\n00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:47.303\nbecause people have been breeding\nthe flowers to make this color,\n\n00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:49.087\nto be this size, to last for a week.\n\n00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:51.500\nYou don't usually give\nyour loved one wildflowers\n\n00:08:51.524 --> 00:08:54.491\nbecause they don't last\na whole lot of time.\n\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.728\nWhat all this does\n\n00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:00.554\nis it flips Darwin completely on his head.\n\n00:09:01.117 --> 00:09:02.858\nSee, for four billion years,\n\n00:09:02.882 --> 00:09:05.947\nwhat lived and died on this planet\ndepended on two principles:\n\n00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:09.090\non natural selection and random mutation.\n\n00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:12.601\nAnd so what lived and died,\nwhat was structured,\n\n00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:14.808\nhas now been flipped on its head.\n\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.419\nAnd what we've done\n\n00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:20.054\nis created this completely\nparallel evolutionary system\n\n00:09:20.078 --> 00:09:23.407\nwhere we are practicing unnatural\nselection and non-random mutation.\n\n00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:25.126\nSo let me explain these things.\n\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.539\nThis is natural selection.\n\n00:09:27.048 --> 00:09:28.453\nThis is unnatural selection.\n\n00:09:28.477 --> 00:09:31.099\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:34.505\nSo what happens with this stuff is,\n\n00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.243\nwe started breeding wolves\nthousands of years ago\n\n00:09:37.267 --> 00:09:39.457\nin central Asia to turn them into dogs.\n\n00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:41.775\nAnd then we started\nturning them into big dogs\n\n00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:43.550\nand into little dogs.\n\n00:09:43.574 --> 00:09:45.361\nBut if you take one of the chihuahuas\n\n00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.233\nyou see in the Herm\u00e8s bags on Fifth Avenue\n\n00:09:48.257 --> 00:09:50.914\nand you let it loose on the African plain,\n\n00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:52.922\nyou can watch natural selection happen.\n\n00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:55.627\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:58.377 --> 00:10:01.194\nFew things on Earth\nare less natural than a cornfield.\n\n00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:05.719\nYou will never, under any scenario,\nwalk through a virgin forest\n\n00:10:05.743 --> 00:10:08.428\nand see the same plant\ngrowing in orderly rows\n\n00:10:08.452 --> 00:10:09.776\nat the same time,\n\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.411\nnothing else living there.\n\n00:10:12.356 --> 00:10:13.515\nWhen you do a cornfield,\n\n00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:15.586\nyou're selecting what lives and what dies.\n\n00:10:16.038 --> 00:10:18.377\nAnd you're doing that\nthrough unnatural selection.\n\n00:10:18.401 --> 00:10:21.538\nIt's the same with a wheat field,\nit's the same with a rice field.\n\n00:10:21.562 --> 00:10:24.177\nIt's the same with a city,\nit's the same with a suburb.\n\n00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:26.096\nIn fact, half the surface of Earth\n\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.627\nhas been unnaturally engineered\n\n00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:30.834\nso that what lives and what dies\nthere is what we want,\n\n00:10:30.858 --> 00:10:33.321\nwhich is the reason why\nyou don't have grizzly bears\n\n00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:35.272\nwalking through downtown Manhattan.\n\n00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:38.894\nHow about this random mutation stuff?\n\n00:10:38.918 --> 00:10:40.361\nWell, this is random mutation.\n\n00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:41.725\nThis is Antonio Alfonseca.\n\n00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:45.019\nHe's otherwise known\nas the Octopus, his nickname.\n\n00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:47.317\nHe was the Relief Pitcher\nof the Year in 2000.\n\n00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:50.677\nAnd he had a random mutation\nthat gave him six fingers\n\n00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.929\non each hand,\n\n00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.595\nwhich turns out to be really useful\nif you're a pitcher.\n\n00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:57.259\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:58.077 --> 00:10:59.807\nHow about non-random mutation?\n\n00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:03.346\nA non-random mutation is beer.\n\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.068\nIt's wine. It's yogurt.\n\n00:11:05.886 --> 00:11:08.222\nHow many times have you walked\nthrough the forest\n\n00:11:08.246 --> 00:11:09.809\nand found all-natural cheese?\n\n00:11:10.817 --> 00:11:12.060\nOr all-natural yogurt?\n\n00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:14.789\nSo we've been engineering this stuff.\n\n00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:16.281\nNow, the interesting thing is,\n\n00:11:16.305 --> 00:11:17.923\nwe get to know the stuff better.\n\n00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:22.035\nWe found one of the single most powerful\ngene-editing instruments,\n\n00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:23.846\nCRISPR, inside yogurt.\n\n00:11:24.986 --> 00:11:26.976\nAnd as we start engineering cells,\n\n00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.280\nwe're producing eight out of the top 10\npharmaceutical products,\n\n00:11:32.204 --> 00:11:34.729\nincluding the stuff that you use\nto treat arthritis,\n\n00:11:34.753 --> 00:11:37.179\nwhich is the number one\nbest-selling drug, Humira.\n\n00:11:37.943 --> 00:11:39.394\nSo this lifecode stuff.\n\n00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:41.563\nIt really is a superpower.\n\n00:11:42.114 --> 00:11:44.028\nIt really is a way of programming stuff,\n\n00:11:44.052 --> 00:11:46.609\nand there's nothing\nthat's going to change us\n\n00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:48.759\nmore than this lifecode.\n\n00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:51.536\nSo as you're thinking of lifecode,\n\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.249\nlet's think of five principles\n\n00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:56.044\nas to how we start guiding,\n\n00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:57.687\nand I'd love you to give me more.\n\n00:11:58.273 --> 00:11:59.775\nSo, principle number one:\n\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.383\nwe have to take responsibility\nfor this stuff.\n\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.551\nThe reason we have to take responsibility\n\n00:12:05.575 --> 00:12:06.936\nis because we're in charge.\n\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.873\nThese aren't random mutations.\n\n00:12:08.897 --> 00:12:11.200\nThis is what we are doing,\nwhat we are choosing.\n\n00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:12.923\nIt's not, \"Stuff happened.\"\n\n00:12:12.947 --> 00:12:14.420\nIt didn't happen at random.\n\n00:12:14.444 --> 00:12:17.048\nIt didn't come down\nby a verdict of somebody else.\n\n00:12:17.072 --> 00:12:18.889\nWe engineer this stuff,\n\n00:12:18.913 --> 00:12:22.158\nand it's the Pottery Barn rule:\nyou break it, you own it.\n\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.449\nPrinciple number two:\n\n00:12:24.473 --> 00:12:27.601\nwe have to recognize and celebrate\ndiversity in this stuff.\n\n00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:30.759\nThere have been at least\n33 versions of hominids\n\n00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.505\nthat have walked around this Earth.\n\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.176\nMost all of them went extinct except us.\n\n00:12:35.762 --> 00:12:37.923\nBut the normal and natural\nstate of this Earth\n\n00:12:37.947 --> 00:12:41.334\nis we have various versions of humans\nwalking around at the same time,\n\n00:12:41.358 --> 00:12:44.015\nwhich is why most of us\nhave some Neanderthal in us.\n\n00:12:44.517 --> 00:12:46.957\nSome of us have some Denisova in us.\n\n00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:49.330\nAnd some in Washington\nhave a lot more of it.\n\n00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:51.932\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:51.956 --> 00:12:53.841\nPrinciple number three:\n\n00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:56.030\nwe have to respect other people's choices.\n\n00:12:56.566 --> 00:12:58.841\nSome people will choose to never alter.\n\n00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:00.675\nSome people will choose to alter all.\n\n00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:03.325\nSome people will choose\nto alter plants but not animals.\n\n00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.400\nSome people will choose\nto alter themselves.\n\n00:13:05.424 --> 00:13:07.687\nSome people will choose\nto evolve themselves.\n\n00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:09.280\nDiversity is not a bad thing,\n\n00:13:09.304 --> 00:13:11.946\nbecause even though we think\nof humans as very diverse,\n\n00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.255\nwe came so close to extinction\n\n00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:16.894\nthat all of us descend\nfrom a single African mother\n\n00:13:16.918 --> 00:13:18.243\nand the consequence of that\n\n00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:22.772\nis there's more genetic diversity\nin 55 African chimpanzees\n\n00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:24.671\nthan there are in seven billion humans.\n\n00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:28.214\nPrinciple number four:\n\n00:13:29.037 --> 00:13:31.037\nwe should take about\na quarter of the Earth\n\n00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:34.018\nand only let Darwin run the show there.\n\n00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.540\nIt doesn't have to be contiguous,\n\n00:13:36.564 --> 00:13:38.338\ndoesn't have to all be tied together.\n\n00:13:38.362 --> 00:13:40.568\nIt should be part\nin the oceans, part on land.\n\n00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:43.975\nBut we should not run every\nevolutionary decision on this planet.\n\n00:13:44.432 --> 00:13:46.870\nWe want to have\nour evolutionary system running.\n\n00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:49.471\nWe want to have Darwin's\nevolutionary system running.\n\n00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:53.171\nAnd it's just really important to have\nthese two things running in parallel\n\n00:13:53.195 --> 00:13:54.712\nand not overwhelm evolution.\n\n00:13:54.736 --> 00:13:58.846\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:02.265 --> 00:14:03.659\nLast thing I'll say.\n\n00:14:04.612 --> 00:14:07.874\nThis is the single most exciting\nadventure human beings have been on.\n\n00:14:07.898 --> 00:14:10.939\nThis is the single greatest superpower\nhumans have ever had.\n\n00:14:10.963 --> 00:14:13.831\nIt would be a crime for you\nnot to participate in this stuff\n\n00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:15.267\nbecause you're scared of it,\n\n00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.030\nbecause you're hiding from it.\n\n00:14:17.054 --> 00:14:20.425\nYou can participate in the ethics.\nYou can participate in the politics.\n\n00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:22.198\nYou can participate in the business.\n\n00:14:22.222 --> 00:14:25.380\nYou can participate in just thinking\nabout where medicine is going,\n\n00:14:25.404 --> 00:14:26.565\nwhere industry is going,\n\n00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:28.392\nwhere we're going to take the world.\n\n00:14:28.416 --> 00:14:30.281\nIt would be a crime for all of us\n\n00:14:30.305 --> 00:14:34.363\nnot to be aware when somebody\nshows up at a swimming pool\n\n00:14:34.387 --> 00:14:36.966\nand says one word, just one word,\n\n00:14:37.457 --> 00:14:39.856\nif you don't listen\nif that word is \"lifecode.\"\n\n00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.158\nThank you very much.\n\n00:14:41.182 --> 00:14:48.395\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A taboo-free way to talk about periods", "duration": "670", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/aditi_gupta_a_taboo_free_way_to_talk_about_periods", "transcript": "Periods. Blood. Menstruation. Gross. Secret. Hidden. Why?A natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month for about half of her life. A phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it. Yet we consider it a taboo. We feel awkward and shameful talking about it.When I got my first periods, I was told to keep it a secret from others \u2014 even from my father and brother. Later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks, our biology teacher skipped the subject.(Laughter)You know what I learned from it? I learned that it is really shameful to talk about it. I learned to be ashamed of my body. I learned to stay unaware of periods in order to stay decent.Research in various parts of India shows that three out of every 10 girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods. And in some parts of Rajasthan this number is as high as nine out of 10 girls being unaware of it. You'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that I have spoken to, who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they're going to die soon.Menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections. But in India, only 12 percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods. If you do the math, 88 percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods.I was one of them. I grew up in a small town called Garhwa, in Jharkhand, where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful. So when I started getting my periods, I began with using rags. After every use I would wash and reuse them. But to store them, I would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating. Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse, and I would often get rashes and infections using them.I wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town. Another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions that are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods. I think you all must be aware of it, but I'll still list it for the few who don't.I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles. I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed. I had to wash my bed sheet after every period, even if it was not stained. I was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance. You'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women.Ironically, most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family. After all, they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms. And in the absence of any intervention, it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation.During my years of work in this field, I have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately. They're not allowed to take baths during periods, and in some households they are even secluded from other family members. About 85 percent of girls and women in India would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month. Can you imagine what this does to the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl? The psychological trauma that this inflicts, affecting her personality, her academic performance and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years?I religiously followed all these restrictive customs for 13 years, until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin, changed my perception about menstruation forever. In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design. We fell in love with each other and I was at ease discussing periods with him. Tuhin knew little about periods.(Laughter)He was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month.(Laughter)Yeah. He was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society. In order to help me with my cramps, he would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation. When he shared his findings with me, I realized how little I knew about menstruation myself. And many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths.That's when we wondered: if we, being so well educated, were so ill-informed about menstruation, there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too. To study \u2014 to understand the problem better, I undertook a year-long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it.While it is generally believed that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon, during my research, I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well. And it exists with the educated urban class, also. While talking to many parents and teachers, I found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods before they have started getting their menstrual cycle. And \u2014 but they lacked the proper means themselves. And since it is a taboo, they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it.Girls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven, but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine. And since it is a taboo, teachers still skip the subject altogether.So school does not teach girls about periods, parents don't talk about it. Where do the girls go? Two decades ago and now \u2014 nothing has changed. I shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered: What if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own \u2014 something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls?During my research, I was collecting a lot of stories. These were stories of experiences of girls during their periods. These stories would make girls curious and interested in talking about menstruation in their close circle. That's what we wanted. We wanted something that would make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it. We wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods.So we decided to create a comic book, where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way. To represent girls in their different phases of puberty, we have three characters. Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet, Jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book and Mira who has already been getting her period. There is a fourth character, Priya Didi. Through her, girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management.While making the book, we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive. During our prototype testing, we found that the girls loved the book. They were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about periods on their own. Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book, and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it.(Laughter)(Applause)The comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo. Many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India. And one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in Ladakh.We made the final version of the book, called \"Menstrupedia Comic\" and launched in September last year. And so far, more than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India and \u2014(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)And 10 different countries. We are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries.15 schools in different parts of India have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation.(Applause)I am amazed to see how volunteers, individuals, parents, teachers, school principals, have come together and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities, have made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo.I dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse, not a disease, but a welcoming change in a girl's life. And I would \u2014(Applause)And I would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here.Dear parents, if you would be ashamed of periods, your daughters would be, too. So please be period positive.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2483, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.478 -->

00:00:30.454\nthat every girl and woman\ngoes through every month\n\n00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:32.654\nfor about half of her life.\n\n00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:35.374\nA phenomenon that is so

00:00:45.998\nWe feel awkward\nand shameful talking about it.\n\n00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.614\nWhen I got my first periods,\n\n00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:51.998\nI was told to keep it\na secret from others --\n\n00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.598\neven from my father and brother.\n\n00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:58.214\nLater when this chapter\nappeared in our textbooks,\n\n00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:00.574\nour biology teacher skipped the subject.\n\n00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:03.278\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.638\nYou know what I learned from it?\n\n00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:09.478\nI learned that it is really\nshameful to talk about it.\n\n00:01:10.038 --> 00:01:12.694\nI learned to be ashamed of my body.\n\n00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.774\nI learned to stay unaware of periods\n\n00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:17.758\nin order to stay decent.\n\n00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:20.214\nResearch in various parts of India\n\n00:01:20.238 --> 00:01:24.974\nshows that three out of every 10 girls\nare not aware of menstruation\n\n00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.758\nat the time of their first periods.\n\n00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:28.974\nAnd in some parts of Rajasthan\n\n00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:33.838\nthis number is as high as nine\nout of 10 girls being unaware of it.\n\n00:01:34.758 --> 00:01:36.414\nYou'd be surprised to know\n\n00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:38.654\nthat most of the girls\nthat I have spoken to,\n\n00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:42.494\nwho did not know about periods\nat the time of their first menstruation\n\n00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:44.894\nthought that they have got blood cancer\n\n00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:46.518\nand they're going to die soon.\n\n00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:51.654\nMenstrual hygiene\nis a very important risk factor\n\n00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.238\nfor reproductive tract infections.\n\n00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:58.174\nBut in India, only 12 percent\nof girls and women\n\n00:01:58.198 --> 00:02:01.958\nhave access to hygienic ways\nof managing their periods.\n\n00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:04.294\nIf you do the math,\n\n00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:09.414\n88 percent of girls and women use\nunhygienic ways to manage their periods.\n\n00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:10.638\nI was one of them.\n\n00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:14.774\nI grew up in a small town\ncalled Garhwa, in Jharkhand,\n\n00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:17.918\nwhere even buying a sanitary napkin\nis considered shameful.\n\n00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:20.853\nSo when I started getting my periods,\n\n00:02:20.877 --> 00:02:22.638\nI began with using rags.\n\n00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:27.174\nAfter every use\nI would wash and reuse them.\n\n00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:28.454\nBut to store them,\n\n00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:31.094\nI would hide and keep it\nin a dark, damp place\n\n00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.718\nso that nobody finds out\nthat I'm menstruating.\n\n00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:37.094\nDue to repeated washing\nthe rags would become coarse,\n\n00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:40.118\nand I would often get rashes\nand infections using them.\n\n00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:45.118\nI wore these already for five years\nuntil I moved out of that town.\n\n00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:49.934\nAnother issue\nthat periods brought in my life\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.254\nthose of the social restrictions\n\n00:02:52.278 --> 00:02:56.614\nthat are imposed upon our girls\nand women when they're on their periods.\n\n00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:58.934\nI think you all must be aware of it,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.918\nbut I'll still list it\nfor the few who don't.\n\n00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:05.158\nI was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.\n\n00:03:05.798 --> 00:03:10.654\nI was not allowed to sit on the sofa\nor some other family member's bed.\n\n00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:13.134\nI had to wash my bed sheet\nafter every period,\n\n00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:15.094\neven if it was not stained.\n\n00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:16.934\nI was considered impure\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.758\nand forbidden from worshipping or touching\nany object of religious importance.\n\n00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:25.054\nYou'll find signposts outside temples\n\n00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:27.518\ndenying the entry\nof menstruating girls and women.\n\n00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:30.414\nIronically,\n\n00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:33.254\nmost of the time it is the older woman\n\n00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:37.718\nwho imposes such restrictions\non younger girls in a family.\n\n00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:42.494\nAfter all, they have grown up\naccepting such restrictions as norms.\n\n00:03:42.518 --> 00:03:45.534\nAnd in the absence of any intervention,\n\n00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.574\nit is the myth and misconception\n\n00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:50.198\nthat propagate\nfrom generation to generation.\n\n00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.054\nDuring my years of work in this field,\n\n00:03:53.078 --> 00:03:54.574\nI have even come across stories\n\n00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:58.214\nwhere girls have to eat\nand wash their dishes separately.\n\n00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.574\nThey're not allowed\nto take baths during periods,\n\n00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:04.678\nand in some households they are even\nsecluded from other family members.\n\n00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:09.214\nAbout 85 percent of girls\nand women in India\n\n00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:14.558\nwould follow one or more restrictive\ncustoms on their periods every month.\n\n00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:16.814\nCan you imagine what this does\n\n00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:19.798\nto the self-esteem\nand self-confidence of a young girl?\n\n00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:23.414\nThe psychological trauma\nthat this inflicts,\n\n00:04:23.438 --> 00:04:26.014\naffecting her personality,\n\n00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:27.774\nher academic performance\n\n00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:32.438\nand every single aspect of growing up\nduring her early formative years?\n\n00:04:33.718 --> 00:04:37.758\nI religiously followed all these\nrestrictive customs for 13 years,\n\n00:04:38.358 --> 00:04:40.734\nuntil a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,\n\n00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:43.318\nchanged my perception\nabout menstruation forever.\n\n00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:49.694\nIn 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing\nour postgraduation in design.\n\n00:04:49.718 --> 00:04:51.374\nWe fell in love with each other\n\n00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:53.838\nand I was at ease\ndiscussing periods with him.\n\n00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:56.518\nTuhin knew little about periods.\n\n00:04:57.478 --> 00:04:59.758\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:07.374\nHe was astonished to know\nthat girls get painful cramps\n\n00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:08.814\nand we bleed every month.\n\n00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:10.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.454\nYeah.\n\n00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.254\nHe was completely shocked to know\n\n00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:19.454\nabout the restrictions that are imposed\nupon menstruating girls and women\n\n00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:22.054\nby their own families and their society.\n\n00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:24.134\nIn order to help me with my cramps,\n\n00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:27.958\nhe would go on the Internet\nand learn more about menstruation.\n\n00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:30.294\nWhen he shared his findings with me,\n\n00:05:30.318 --> 00:05:33.318\nI realized how little I knew\nabout menstruation myself.\n\n00:05:33.918 --> 00:05:37.038\nAnd many of my beliefs\nactually turned out to be myths.\n\n00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:39.854\nThat's when we wondered:\n\n00:05:39.878 --> 00:05:42.214\nif we, being so well educated,\n\n00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:44.334\nwere so ill-informed about menstruation,\n\n00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:48.358\nthere would be millions of girls out there\nwho would be ill-informed, too.\n\n00:05:49.718 --> 00:05:50.934\nTo study --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.734\nto understand the problem better,\n\n00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:57.374\nI undertook a year-long research to study\nthe lack of awareness about menstruation\n\n00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:58.998\nand the root cause behind it.\n\n00:05:59.918 --> 00:06:01.654\nWhile it is generally believed\n\n00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:07.654\nthat menstrual unawareness\nand misconception is a rural phenomenon,\n\n00:06:07.678 --> 00:06:08.894\nduring my research,\n\n00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:11.894\nI found that it is as much\nan urban phenomenon as well.\n\n00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:16.278\nAnd it exists with the educated\nurban class, also.\n\n00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:19.734\nWhile talking to many\nparents and teachers,\n\n00:06:19.758 --> 00:06:25.054\nI found that many of them actually\nwanted to educate girls about periods\n\n00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:27.718\nbefore they have started\ngetting their menstrual cycle.\n\n00:06:28.798 --> 00:06:30.014\nAnd --\n\n00:06:30.038 --> 00:06:33.574\nbut they lacked\nthe proper means themselves.\n\n00:06:33.598 --> 00:06:34.854\nAnd since it is a taboo,\n\n00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:37.918\nthey feel inhibition\nand shameful in talking about it.\n\n00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:43.414\nGirls nowadays get their periods\nin classes six and seven,\n\n00:06:43.438 --> 00:06:45.054\nbut our educational curriculum\n\n00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:48.878\nteaches girls about periods\nonly in standard eight and nine.\n\n00:06:49.758 --> 00:06:51.318\nAnd since it is a taboo,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.398\nteachers still\nskip the subject altogether.\n\n00:06:56.798 --> 00:07:01.054\nSo school does not\nteach girls about periods,\n\n00:07:01.078 --> 00:07:03.214\nparents don't talk about it.\n\n00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:04.638\nWhere do the girls go?\n\n00:07:05.638 --> 00:07:08.478\nTwo decades ago and now --\n\n00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:10.358\nnothing has changed.\n\n00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:14.898\nI shared these finding with Tuhin\nand we wondered:\n\n00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:16.534\nWhat if we could create something\n\n00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:21.134\nthat would help girls understand\nabout menstruation on their own --\n\n00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:25.374\nsomething that would help\nparents and teachers\n\n00:07:25.398 --> 00:07:28.318\ntalk about periods\ncomfortably to young girls?\n\n00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:31.414\nDuring my research,\n\n00:07:31.438 --> 00:07:33.414\nI was collecting a lot of stories.\n\n00:07:33.438 --> 00:07:38.118\nThese were stories of experiences\nof girls during their periods.\n\n00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:42.014\nThese stories would make girls\ncurious and interested\n\n00:07:42.038 --> 00:07:45.974\nin talking about menstruation\nin their close circle.\n\n00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.454\nThat's what we wanted.\n\n00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:50.814\nWe wanted something\nthat would make the girls curious\n\n00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:53.014\nand drive them to learn about it.\n\n00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:56.198\nWe wanted to use these stories\nto teach girls about periods.\n\n00:07:57.318 --> 00:08:00.414\nSo we decided to create a comic book,\n\n00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.694\nwhere the cartoon characters\nwould enact these stories\n\n00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:07.598\nand educate girls about menstruation\nin a fun and engaging way.\n\n00:08:08.318 --> 00:08:11.334\nTo represent girls\nin their different phases of puberty,\n\n00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:12.998\nwe have three characters.\n\n00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:16.694\nPinki, who has not gotten her period yet,\n\n00:08:16.718 --> 00:08:20.214\nJiya who gets her period\nduring the narrative of the book\n\n00:08:20.238 --> 00:08:23.494\nand Mira who has already\nbeen getting her period.\n\n00:08:23.518 --> 00:08:25.934\nThere is a fourth character, Priya Didi.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.494\nThrough her, girls come to know\nabout the various aspects of growing up\n\n00:08:29.518 --> 00:08:31.318\nand menstrual hygiene management.\n\n00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:34.356\nWhile making the book, we took great care\n\n00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:38.334\nthat none of the illustrations\nwere objectionable in any way\n\n00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:40.318\nand that it is culturally sensitive.\n\n00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:45.014\nDuring our prototype testing,\nwe found that the girls loved the book.\n\n00:08:45.038 --> 00:08:46.414\nThey were keen on reading it\n\n00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:49.198\nand knowing more and more\nabout periods on their own.\n\n00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:53.014\nParents and teachers were\ncomfortable in talking about periods\n\n00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:54.733\nto young girls using the book,\n\n00:08:54.757 --> 00:08:57.734\nand sometimes even boys\nwere interested in reading it.\n\n00:08:57.758 --> 00:08:59.894\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:01.678\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:03.798 --> 00:09:07.614\nThe comic book helped\nin creating an environment\n\n00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:10.078\nwhere menstruation ceased to be a taboo.\n\n00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:14.734\nMany of the volunteers took this prototype\nthemselves to educate girls\n\n00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:18.694\nand take menstrual awareness workshops\nin five different states in India.\n\n00:09:18.718 --> 00:09:22.094\nAnd one of the volunteers\ntook this prototype to educate young monks\n\n00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:24.334\nand took it to this monastery in Ladakh.\n\n00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:27.694\nWe made the final version of the book,\ncalled \"Menstrupedia Comic\"\n\n00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:30.478\nand launched in September last year.\n\n00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.454\nAnd so far,\n\n00:09:32.478 --> 00:09:36.814\nmore than 4,000 girls have been\neducated by using the book in India and --\n\n00:09:36.838 --> 00:09:39.494\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:39.518

Sounds impossible, doesn't it? It's not. And the answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use. And I'm going to tell you the secret.First, find rocks of the right age. Second, those rocks must be sedimentary rocks. And third, layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed. That's it. Find those three things and get yourself on the ground, chances are good that you will find fossils.Now let me break down this formula. Organisms exist only during certain geological intervals. So you have to find rocks of the right age, depending on what your interests are. If you want to find trilobites, you have to find the really, really old rocks of the Paleozoic \u2014 rocks between a half a billion and a quarter-billion years old. Now, if you want to find dinosaurs, don't look in the Paleozoic, you won't find them. They hadn't evolved yet. You have to find the younger rocks of the Mesozoic, and in the case of dinosaurs, between 235 and 66 million years ago.Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point, because the Earth is, to a coarse degree, geologically mapped. This is hard-won information. The annals of Earth history are written in rocks, one chapter upon the next, such that the oldest pages are on bottom and the youngest on top.Now, were it quite that easy, geologists would rejoice. It's not. The library of Earth is an old one. It has no librarian to impose order. Operating over vast swaths of time, myriad geological processes offer every possible insult to the rocks of ages. Most pages are destroyed soon after being written. Some pages are overwritten, creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests of long-gone landscapes. Pages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time are never truly safe. Unlike the Moon \u2014 our dead, rocky companion \u2014 the Earth is alive, pulsing with creative and destructive forces that power its geological metabolism. Lunar rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts all date back to about the age of the Solar System. Moon rocks are forever. Earth rocks, on the other hand, face the perils of a living lithosphere. All will suffer ruination, through some combination of mutilation, compression, folding, tearing, scorching and baking.Thus, the volumes of Earth history are incomplete and disheveled. The library is vast and magnificent \u2014 but decrepit. And it was this tattered complexity in the rock record that obscured its meaning until relatively recently. Nature provided no card catalog for geologists \u2014 this would have to be invented. Five thousand years after the Sumerians learned to record their thoughts on clay tablets, the Earth's volumes remained inscrutable to humans. We were geologically illiterate, unaware of the antiquity of our own planet and ignorant of our connection to deep time.It wasn't until the turn of the 19th century that our blinders were removed, first, with the publication of James Hutton's \"Theory of the Earth,\" in which he told us that the Earth reveals no vestige of a beginning and no prospect of an end; and then, with the printing of William Smith's map of Britain, the first country-scale geological map, giving us for the first time predictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur. After that, you could say things like, \"If we go over there, we should be in the Jurassic,\" or, \"If we go up over that hill, we should find the Cretaceous.\"So now, if you want to find trilobites, get yourself a good geological map and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic. If you want to find dinosaurs like I do, find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there. Now of course, you can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock, a rock made by sand and mud. You can't have a fossil in an igneous rock formed by magma, like a granite, or in a metamorphic rock that's been heated and squeezed. And you have to get yourself in a desert. It's not that dinosaurs particularly lived in deserts; they lived on every land mass and in every imaginable environment. It's that you need to go to a place that's a desert today, a place that doesn't have too many plants covering up the rocks, and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface. So find those three things: rocks of the right age, that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert, and get yourself on the ground, and you literally walk until you see a bone sticking out of the rock.Here's a picture that I took in Southern Patagonia. Every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone. So when you're in that right situation, it's not a question of whether you'll find fossils or not; you're going to find fossils. The question is: Will you find something that is scientifically significant? And to help with that, I'm going to add a fourth part to our formula, which is this: get as far away from other paleontologists as possible.(Laughter)It's not that I don't like other paleontologists. When you go to a place that's relatively unexplored, you have a much better chance of not only finding fossils but of finding something that's new to science. So that's my formula for finding dinosaurs, and I've applied it all around the world.In the austral summer of 2004, I went to the bottom of South America, to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina, to prospect for dinosaurs: a place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age, in a desert, a place that had been barely visited by paleontologists. And we found this. This is a femur, a thigh bone, of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur. That bone is 2.2 meters across. That's over seven feet long.Now, unfortunately, that bone was isolated. We dug and dug and dug, and there wasn't another bone around. But it made us hungry to go back the next year for more. And on the first day of that next field season, I found this: another two-meter femur, only this time not isolated, this time associated with 145 other bones of a giant plant eater. And after three more hard, really brutal field seasons, the quarry came to look like this. And there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me. The giant that lay in this grave, the new species of dinosaur, we would eventually call \"Dreadnoughtus schrani.\" Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet from snout to tail. It stood two-and-a-half stories at the shoulder, and all fleshed out in life, it weighed 65 tons. People ask me sometimes, \"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?\" That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.Now, one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist is when you find a new species, you get to name it. And I've always thought it a shame that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs are too often portrayed as passive, lumbering platters of meat on the landscape.(Laughter)They're not. Big herbivores can be surly, and they can be territorial \u2014 you do not want to mess with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo. The bison in Yellowstone injure far more people than do the grizzly bears. So can you imagine a big bull, 65-ton Dreadnoughtus in the breeding season, defending a territory? That animal would have been incredibly dangerous, a menace to all around, and itself would have had nothing to fear. And thus the name, \"Dreadnoughtus,\" or, \"fears nothing.\"Now, to grow so large, an animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been a model of efficiency. That long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment, passively controlling its temperature. And that long neck also serves as a super-efficient feeding mechanism. Dreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck clear out a huge envelope of vegetation, taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few. And these animals evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance, giving them immense stability, because when you're 65 tons, when you're literally as big as a house, the penalty for falling over is death. Yeah, these animals are big and tough, but they won't take a blow like that. Dreadnoughtus falls over, ribs break and pierce lungs. Organs burst. If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus, you don't get to fall down in life \u2014 even once.Now, after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried and de-fleshed by a multitude of bacteria, worms and insects, its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis, exchanging molecules with the groundwater and becoming more and more like the entombing rock. As layer upon layer of sediment accumulated, pressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove whose firm and enduring grip held each bone in a stabilizing embrace.And then came the long ... nothing. Epoch after epoch of sameness, nonevents without number. All the while, the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging in perfect equilibrium within its rocky grave. Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above. The dinosaurs would reign for another 12 million years before their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse. The continents drifted. The mammals rose. The Ice Age came.And then, in East Africa, an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought. These brainy primates were not particularly fast or strong. But they excelled at covering ground, and in a remarkable diaspora surpassing even the dinosaurs' record of territorial conquest, they dispersed across the planet, ravishing every ecosystem they encountered, along the way, inventing culture and metalworking and painting and dance and music and science and rocket ships that would eventually take 12 particularly excellent apes to the surface of the Moon.With seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet, it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan buried beneath the badlands of Southern Patagonia. I was that ape. And standing there, alone in the desert, it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small. But the Earth is very, very old. And over vast tracts of time, the improbable becomes the probable. That's the magic of the geological record. Thus, multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of fossils, each one a small miracle, but collectively, inevitable.Sixty-six million years ago, an asteroid hits the Earth and wipes out the dinosaurs. This easily might not have been. But we only get one history, and it's the one that we have. But this particular reality was not inevitable. The tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from Earth would have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin. The pivotal, calamitous day during which the dinosaurs were wiped out, setting the stage for the modern world as we know it didn't have to be. It could've just been another day \u2014 a Thursday, perhaps \u2014 among the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs. But over geological time, improbable, nearly impossible events do occur. Along the path from our wormy, Cambrian ancestors to primates dressed in suits, innumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular reality. The bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years. Who could have imagined that a single species of shrew-like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizing and understanding the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?I once stood at the head of the Missouri River and bestraddled it. There, it's nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture, high in the Bitterroot Mountains. The stream next to it runs a few hundred yards and ends in a small pond. Those two streams \u2014 they look identical. But one is an anonymous trickle of water, and the other is the Missouri River. Now go down to the mouth of the Missouri, near St. Louis, and it's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal. But go up into the Bitterroots and look at the Missouri, and human prospection does not allow us to see it as anything special. Now go back to the Cretaceous Period and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors. You would never guess that they would amount to anything special, and they probably wouldn't have, were it not for that pesky asteroid.Now, make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems and let them run. You will never get the same result. No doubt, those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable, but they would not be our world and they would not have our history. There are an infinite number of histories that we could've had. We only get one, and wow, did we ever get a good one. Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real. Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real. Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car really existed.Why study the ancient past? Because it gives us perspective and humility. The dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction, snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own. They didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice. We, on the other hand, do have a choice. And the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting. Right now, our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe, it can rightly be called the sixth extinction. Only unlike the dinosaurs, we can see it coming. And unlike the dinosaurs, we can do something about it. That choice is ours.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2484, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:15.045\nHow do you find a

by sand and mud.\n\n00:04:34.447 --> 00:04:35.614\nYou can't have a fossil\n\n00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:38.962\nin an igneous rock formed\nby magma, like a granite,\n\n00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:42.048\nor in a metamorphic rock\nthat's been heated and squeezed.\n\n00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:44.866\nAnd you have to get yourself in a desert.\n\n00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:48.417\nIt's not that dinosaurs\nparticularly lived in deserts;\n\n00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:50.005\nthey lived on every land mass\n\n00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.086\nand in every imaginable environment.\n\n00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:55.499\nIt's that you need to go to a place\nthat's a desert today,\n\n00:04:55.523 --> 00:04:58.697\na place that doesn't have\ntoo many plants covering up the rocks,\n\n00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.601\nand a place where erosion is always\nexposing new bones at the surface.\n\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.793\nSo find those three things:\n\n00:05:04.817 --> 00:05:06.372\nrocks of the right age,\n\n00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:09.445\nthat are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,\n\n00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.026\nand get yourself on the ground,\n\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.562\nand you literally walk\n\n00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:15.174\nuntil you see a bone\nsticking out of the rock.\n\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.622\nHere's a picture that I took\nin Southern Patagonia.\n\n00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:23.067\nEvery pebble that you see\non the ground there\n\n00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:24.614\nis a piece of dinosaur bone.\n\n00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:27.302\nSo when you're in that right situation,\n\n00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:30.080\nit's not a question of whether\nyou'll find fossils or not;\n\n00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:31.493\nyou're going to find fossils.\n\n00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:35.565\nThe question is: Will you find something\nthat is scientifically significant?\n\n00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.559\nAnd to help with that, I'm going to add\na fourth part to our formula,\n\n00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:40.760\nwhich is this:\n\n00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.849\nget as far away from other\npaleontologists as possible.\n\n00:05:44.873 --> 00:05:46.844\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:49.223\nIt's not that I don't like\nother paleontologists.\n\n00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:51.772\nWhen you go to a place\nthat's relatively unexplored,\n\n00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:54.610\nyou have a much better chance\nof not only finding fossils\n\n00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:57.143\nbut of finding something\nthat's new to science.\n\n00:05:57.746 --> 00:05:59.857\nSo that's my formula\nfor finding dinosaurs,\n\n00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:01.914\nand I've applied it all around the world.\n\n00:06:01.938 --> 00:06:04.266\nIn the austral summer of 2004,\n\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.115\nI went to the bottom of South America,\n\n00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.256\nto the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,\n\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.533\nto prospect for dinosaurs:\n\n00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:13.930\na place that had terrestrial\nsedimentary rocks of the right age,\n\n00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:15.157\nin a desert,\n\n00:06:15.181 --> 00:06:18.443\na place that had been barely visited\nby paleontologists.\n\n00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:20.427\nAnd we found this.\n\n00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:23.277\nThis is a femur, a thigh bone,\n\n00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:25.670\nof a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.\n\n00:06:25.694 --> 00:06:28.528\nThat bone is 2.2 meters across.\n\n00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:30.641\nThat's over seven feet long.\n\n00:06:31.765 --> 00:06:33.865\nNow, unfortunately,\nthat bone was isolated.\n\n00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.928\nWe dug and dug and dug,\nand there wasn't another bone around.\n\n00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:39.647\nBut it made us hungry to go back\nthe next year for more.\n\n00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:42.274\nAnd on the first day\nof that next field season,\n\n00:06:42.298 --> 00:06:45.667\nI found this: another two-meter femur,\n\n00:06:45.691 --> 00:06:47.334\nonly this time not isolated,\n\n00:06:47.358 --> 00:06:50.453\nthis time associated with 145 other bones\n\n00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.277\nof a giant plant eater.\n\n00:06:53.022 --> 00:06:57.118\nAnd after three more hard,\nreally brutal field seasons,\n\n00:06:57.142 --> 00:06:59.094\nthe quarry came to look like this.\n\n00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:03.673\nAnd there you see the tail\nof that great beast wrapping around me.\n\n00:07:03.697 --> 00:07:07.249\nThe giant that lay in this grave,\nthe new species of dinosaur,\n\n00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:10.971\nwe would eventually call\n\"Dreadnoughtus schrani.\"\n\n00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:14.467\nDreadnoughtus was 85 feet\nfrom snout to tail.\n\n00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:17.666\nIt stood two-and-a-half stories\nat the shoulder,\n\n00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:22.359\nand all fleshed out in life,\nit weighed 65 tons.\n\n00:07:23.248 --> 00:07:26.830\nPeople ask me sometimes,\n\"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?\"\n\n00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:29.638\nThat's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.\n\n00:07:30.627 --> 00:07:33.667\nNow, one of the really cool things\nabout being a paleontologist\n\n00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:36.460\nis when you find a new species,\nyou get to name it.\n\n00:07:36.484 --> 00:07:40.318\nAnd I've always thought it a shame\nthat these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs\n\n00:07:40.342 --> 00:07:44.821\nare too often portrayed as passive,\nlumbering platters of meat\n\n00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:46.090\non the landscape.\n\n00:07:46.114 --> 00:07:47.240\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:47.543 --> 00:07:48.842\nThey're not.\n\n00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:51.885\nBig herbivores can be surly,\nand they can be territorial --\n\n00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:56.432\nyou do not want to mess with a hippo\nor a rhino or a water buffalo.\n\n00:07:56.829 --> 00:08:01.780\nThe bison in Yellowstone injure\nfar more people than do the grizzly bears.\n\n00:08:01.804 --> 00:08:06.945\nSo can you imagine a big bull,\n65-ton Dreadnoughtus\n\n00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:08.672\nin the breeding season,\n\n00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.196\ndefending a territory?\n\n00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.268\nThat animal would have been\nincredibly dangerous,\n\n00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:18.013\na menace to all around, and itself\nwould have had nothing to fear.\n\n00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:20.690\nAnd thus the name, \"Dreadnoughtus,\"\n\n00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:22.415\nor, \"fears nothing.\"\n\n00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:25.171\nNow, to grow so large,\n\n00:08:25.195 --> 00:08:27.807\nan animal like Dreadnoughtus\nwould've had to have been\n\n00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:28.988\na model of efficiency.\n\n00:08:29.012 --> 00:08:32.775\nThat long neck and long tail help it\nradiate heat into the environment,\n\n00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.337\npassively controlling its temperature.\n\n00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:38.866\nAnd that long neck also serves\nas a super-efficient feeding mechanism.\n\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.670\nDreadnoughtus could stand\nin one place and with that neck\n\n00:08:41.694 --> 00:08:43.986\nclear out a huge envelope of vegetation,\n\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.924\ntaking in tens of thousands of calories\nwhile expending very few.\n\n00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:52.879\nAnd these animals evolved\na bulldog-like wide-gait stance,\n\n00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:54.718\ngiving them immense stability,\n\n00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:59.659\nbecause when you're 65 tons,\nwhen you're literally as big as a house,\n\n00:08:59.683 --> 00:09:01.790\nthe penalty for falling over\n\n00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:02.971\nis death.\n\n00:09:03.635 --> 00:09:05.540\nYeah, these animals are big and tough,\n\n00:09:05.564 --> 00:09:07.341\nbut they won't take a blow like that.\n\n00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:09.946\nDreadnoughtus falls over,\nribs break and pierce lungs.\n\n00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.495\nOrgans burst.\n\n00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.305\nIf you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,\n\n00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:15.906\nyou don't get to fall down\nin life -- even once.\n\n00:09:17.622 --> 00:09:21.188\nNow, after this particular\nDreadnoughtus carcass was buried\n\n00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:25.932\nand de-fleshed by a multitude\nof bacteria, worms and insects,\n\n00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:28.121\nits bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,\n\n00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:30.161\nexchanging molecules with the groundwater\n\n00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:32.803\nand becoming more and more\nlike the entombing rock.\n\n00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:35.937\nAs layer upon layer\nof sediment accumulated,\n\n00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:38.787\npressure from all sides\nweighed in like a stony glove\n\n00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:44.436\nwhose firm and enduring grip held\neach bone in a stabilizing embrace.\n\n00:09:45.612 --> 00:09:47.262\nAnd then came the long ...\n\n00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:49.231\nnothing.\n\n00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:53.144\nEpoch after epoch of sameness,\n\n00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:55.112\nnonevents without number.\n\n00:09:55.459 --> 00:09:58.881\nAll the while, the skeleton lay\neverlasting and unchanging\n\n00:09:58.905 --> 00:10:01.268\nin perfect equilibrium\n\n00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:03.005\nwithin its rocky grave.\n\n00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:05.970\nMeanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.\n\n00:10:05.994 --> 00:10:08.641\nThe dinosaurs would reign\nfor another 12 million years\n\n00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:12.929\nbefore their hegemony was snuffed out\nin a fiery apocalypse.\n\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.178\nThe continents drifted. The mammals rose.\n\n00:10:16.202 --> 00:10:17.573\nThe Ice Age came.\n\n00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:20.828\nAnd then, in East Africa,\n\n00:10:20.852 --> 00:10:26.464\nan unpromising species of ape\nevolved the odd trick of sentient thought.\n\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.162\nThese brainy primates were not\nparticularly fast or strong.\n\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.226\nBut they excelled at covering ground,\n\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.119\nand in a remarkable diaspora\n\n00:10:36.143 --> 00:10:39.285\nsurpassing even the dinosaurs' record\nof territorial conquest,\n\n00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:41.239\nthey dispersed across the planet,\n\n00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:44.443\nravishing every ecosystem\nthey encountered,\n\n00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:47.648\nalong the way, inventing culture\nand metalworking and painting\n\n00:10:47.672 --> 00:10:49.014\nand dance and music\n\n00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:50.958\nand science\n\n00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:56.280\nand rocket ships that would eventually\ntake 12 particularly excellent apes\n\n00:10:56.304 --> 00:10:58.155\nto the surface of the Moon.\n\n00:11:00.858 --> 00:11:04.497\nWith seven billion peripatetic\nHomo sapiens on the planet,\n\n00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:06.428\nit was perhaps inevitable\n\n00:11:06.452 --> 00:11:10.490\nthat one of them would eventually\ntrod on the grave of the magnificent titan\n\n00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:13.466\nburied beneath the badlands\nof Southern Patagonia.\n\n00:11:14.572 --> 00:11:15.823\nI was that ape.\n\n00:11:16.996 --> 00:11:19.939\nAnd standing there, alone in the desert,\n\n00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:21.749\nit was not lost on me\n\n00:11:21.773 --> 00:11:25.403\nthat the chance of any one individual\nentering the fossil record\n\n00:11:25.427 --> 00:11:27.100\nis vanishingly small.\n\n00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:30.045\nBut the Earth is very, very old.\n\n00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:34.329\nAnd over vast tracts of time,\nthe improbable becomes the probable.\n\n00:11:34.353 --> 00:11:37.044\nThat's the magic of the geological record.\n\n00:11:37.068 --> 00:11:40.250\nThus, multitudinous creatures\nliving and dying on an old planet\n\n00:11:40.274 --> 00:11:42.201\nleave behind immense numbers of fossils,\n\n00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:43.867\neach one a small miracle,\n\n00:11:44.649 --> 00:11:47.182\nbut collectively, inevitable.\n\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.403\nSixty-six million years ago,\nan asteroid hits the Earth\n\n00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:53.594\nand wipes out the dinosaurs.\n\n00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:56.657\nThis easily might not have been.\n\n00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.125\nBut we only get one history,\nand it's the one that we have.\n\n00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:02.425\nBut this particular reality\nwas not inevitable.\n\n00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:05.251\nThe tiniest perturbation\nof that asteroid far from Earth\n\n00:12:05.275 --> 00:12:08.276\nwould have caused it to miss\nour planet by a wide margin.\n\n00:12:08.712 --> 00:12:12.065\nThe pivotal, calamitous day during which\nthe dinosaurs were wiped out,\n\n00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:15.300\nsetting the stage\nfor the modern world as we know it\n\n00:12:15.324 --> 00:12:16.856\ndidn't have to be.\n\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.845\nIt could've just been another day --\n\n00:12:19.401 --> 00:12:20.742\na Thursday, perhaps --\n\n00:12:21.814 --> 00:12:26.741\namong the 63 billion days\nalready enjoyed by the dinosaurs.\n\n00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:28.656\nBut over geological time,\n\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.565\nimprobable, nearly impossible events\n\n00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:32.740\ndo occur.\n\n00:12:32.764 --> 00:12:35.687\nAlong the path from our wormy,\nCambrian ancestors\n\n00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:38.114\nto primates dressed in suits,\n\n00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:43.019\ninnumerable forks in the road\nled us to this very particular reality.\n\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.032\nThe bones of Dreadnoughtus\nlay underground for 77 million years.\n\n00:12:48.857 --> 00:12:50.028\nWho could have imagined\n\n00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:53.016\nthat a single species of shrew-like mammal\n\n00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.084\nliving in the cracks of the dinosaur world\n\n00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.160\nwould evolve into sentient beings\n\n00:12:57.184 --> 00:12:59.540\ncapable of characterizing\nand understanding\n\n00:12:59.564 --> 00:13:02.571\nthe very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?\n\n00:13:04.733 --> 00:13:07.756\nI once stood at the head\nof the Missouri River\n\n00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:10.446\nand bestraddled it.\n\n00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.283\nThere, it's nothing more\nthan a gurgle of water\n\n00:13:13.307 --> 00:13:17.918\nthat issues forth from beneath a rock\nin a boulder in a pasture,\n\n00:13:17.942 --> 00:13:19.639\nhigh in the Bitterroot Mountains.\n\n00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:22.515\nThe stream next to it\nruns a few hundred yards\n\n00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:24.817\nand ends in a small pond.\n\n00:13:25.928 --> 00:13:28.825\nThose two streams -- they look identical.\n\n00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.229\nBut one is an anonymous trickle of water,\n\n00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:34.522\nand the other is the Missouri River.\n\n00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:39.122\nNow go down to the mouth\nof the Missouri, near St. Louis,\n\n00:13:39.146 --> 00:13:41.863\nand it's pretty obvious\nthat that river is a big deal.\n\n00:13:42.598 --> 00:13:45.312\nBut go up into the Bitterroots\nand look at the Missouri,\n\n00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:49.806\nand human prospection does not\nallow us to see it as anything special.\n\n00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:52.942\nNow go back to the Cretaceous Period\n\n00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.411\nand look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.\n\n00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:56.872\nYou would never guess\n\n00:13:56.896 --> 00:13:58.973\nthat they would amount\nto anything special,\n\n00:13:58.997 --> 00:14:00.645\nand they probably wouldn't have,\n\n00:14:00.669 --> 00:14:02.906\nwere it not for that pesky asteroid.\n\n00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:07.116\nNow, make a thousand more worlds\nand a thousand more solar systems\n\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.426\nand let them run.\n\n00:14:09.005 --> 00:14:11.159\nYou will never get the same result.\n\n00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:14.588\nNo doubt, those worlds would be\nboth amazing and amazingly improbable,\n\n00:14:14.612 --> 00:14:17.920\nbut they would not be our world\nand they would not have our history.\n\n00:14:17.944 --> 00:14:20.923\nThere are an infinite number of histories\nthat we could've had.\n\n00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:23.473\nWe only get one, and wow,\ndid we ever get a good one.\n\n00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:26.335\nDinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.\n\n00:14:27.016 --> 00:14:30.381\nSea monsters like the mosasaur were real.\n\n00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:35.270\nDragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle\nand pill bugs the length of a car\n\n00:14:35.294 --> 00:14:36.857\nreally existed.\n\n00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.753\nWhy study the ancient past?\n\n00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.277\nBecause it gives us perspective\n\n00:14:45.023 --> 00:14:46.277\nand humility.\n\n00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:50.367\nThe dinosaurs died in the world's\nfifth mass extinction,\n\n00:14:50.391 --> 00:14:54.159\nsnuffed out in a cosmic accident\nthrough no fault of their own.\n\n00:14:55.072 --> 00:14:58.531\nThey didn't see it coming,\nand they didn't have a choice.\n\n00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:03.433\nWe, on the other hand, do have a choice.\n\n00:15:03.901 --> 00:15:07.892\nAnd the nature of the fossil record\ntells us that our place on this planet\n\n00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:10.715\nis both precarious\nand potentially fleeting.\n\n00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:14.853\nRight now, our species is propagating\nan environmental disaster\n\n00:15:14.877 --> 00:15:18.460\nof geological proportions\nthat is so broad and so severe,\n\n00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:21.109\nit can rightly be called\nthe sixth extinction.\n\n00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:24.203\nOnly unlike the dinosaurs,\n\n00:15:25.086 --> 00:15:26.577\nwe can see it coming.\n\n00:15:27.396 --> 00:15:29.069\nAnd unlike the dinosaurs,\n\n00:15:29.666 --> 00:15:31.402\nwe can do something about it.\n\n00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.773\nThat choice is ours.\n\n00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:36.599\nThank you.\n\n00:15:36.623 --> 00:15:48.721\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A smart loan for people with no credit history (yet)", "duration": "491", "url":

loan?Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars to the person sitting two rows behind you. What would you need to know about that person before you'd feel comfortable?My mom came to the US from India in her late thirties. She's a doctor in Brooklyn, and she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services, whether they can pay right away or not. I remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store or on the sidewalk, and sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot for previous appointments. She would thank them, and ask them about their families and their health. She gave them credit because she trusted them.Most of us are like my mom. We would give credit to someone we know or that we live next to. But most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger unless we know a little something about them.Banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions don't know us on a personal level, but they do have a way of trusting us, and that's through our credit scores. Our credit scores have been created through an aggregation and analysis of our public consumer credit data. And because of them, we have pretty much easy access to all of the goods and services that we need, from getting electricity to buying a home, or taking a risk and starting a business.But ... there are 2.5 billion people around the world that don't have a credit score. That's a third of the world's population. They don't have a score because there are no formal public records on them \u2014 no bank accounts, no credit histories and no social security numbers. And because they don't have a score, they don't have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their lives. They are not trusted.So we wanted to find a way to build trust and to open up financial access for these 2.5 billion. So we created a mobile application that builds credit scores for them using mobile data. There are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets. And people are using them the same way that we do. They're texting their friends, they're looking up directions, they're browsing the Internet and they're even making financial transactions.Over time, this data is getting captured on our phones, and it provides a really rich picture of a person's life. Our customers give us access to this data and we capture it through our mobile application. It helps us understand the creditworthiness of people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya. Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades has been running a food stall in the central business district. She has three sons who she put through vocational school, and she's also the leader of her local chama, or savings group.Jenipher's food stall does well. She makes just enough every day to cover her expenses. But she's not financially secure. Any emergency could force her into debt. And she has no discretionary income to improve her family's way of living, for emergencies, or for investing into growing her business. If Jenipher wants credit, her options are limited. She could get a microloan, but she'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility. And even then, the loan sizes would be way too small to really have an impact on her business, averaging around 150 dollars. Loan sharks are always an option, but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent, they're financially risky. And because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a credit history, she can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan.But one day, Jenipher's son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan. Jenipher answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device.And here's what we saw. So, bad news first. Jenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history. These are factors that would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank. But there were other points in her history that showed us a much richer picture of her potential. So for one, we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda. Well, it turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts. We could also see that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day, she actually had pretty regular travel patterns, and she was either at home or at her food stall. And the data shows a six percent increase in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time.We could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network. Our data shows that people who communicate with more than 58 different contacts tend to be more likely to be good borrowers. In Jenipher's case, she communicated with 89 different individuals, which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment.These are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness. And after analyzing all of these different data points, we took the first risk and gave Jenipher a loan. This is data that would not be found on a paper trail or in any formal financial record. But it proves trust. By looking beyond income, we can see that people in emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing and have the capacity to repay.Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya in just the past year. And our repayment rates are above 90 percent \u2014 which, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates.With something as simple as a credit score, we're giving people the power to build their own futures. Our customers have used their loans for family expenses, emergencies, travel and for investing back into growing their businesses. They're now building better economies and communities where more people can succeed.Over the past two years of using our product, Jenipher has increased her savings by 60 percent. She's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own restaurant. She's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank, because she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it.I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week, and she told me how excited she was to get started. She said, \"Only my son believed I could do this. I didn't think this was for me.\" She's lived her whole life believing that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her.Our job now is to open the world to Jenipher and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2486, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:14.796\nHow much do you need\nto know

00:05:46.267\ntend to be more likely\nto be good borrowers.\n\n00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.560\nIn Jenipher's case,\n\n00:05:47.584 --> 00:05:51.627\nshe communicated\nwith 89 different individuals,\n\n00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:54.902\nwhich showed a nine percent\nincrease in her repayment.\n\n00:05:55.846 --> 00:05:59.613\nThese are just some of the thousands\nof different data

points,\n\n00:06:06.452 --> 00:06:08.424\nwe took the first risk\n\n00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:10.491\nand gave Jenipher a loan.\n\n00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:14.654\nThis is data that would not\nbe found on a paper trail\n\n00:06:14.678 --> 00:06:17.246\nor in any formal financial record.\n\n00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:19.466\nBut it proves trust.\n\n00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.128\nBy looking beyond income,\n\n00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:24.309\nwe can see that people in emerging markets\n\n00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:28.002\nthat may seem risky\nand unpredictable on the surface\n\n00:06:28.026 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/r_luke_dubois_insightful_human_portraits_made_from_data", "transcript": "So I'm an artist, but a little bit of a peculiar one. I don't paint. I can't draw. My shop teacher in high school wrote that I was a menace on my report card. You probably don't really want to see my photographs. But there is one thing I know how to do: I know how to program a computer. I can code.And people will tell me that 100 years ago, folks like me didn't exist, that it was impossible, that art made with data is a new thing, it's a product of our age, it's something that's really important to think of as something that's very \"now.\" And that's true.But there is an art form that's been around for a very long time that's really about using information, abstract information, to make emotionally resonant pieces. And it's called music. We've been making music for tens of thousands of years, right? And if you think about what music is \u2014 notes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies \u2014 these things are algorithms. These things are systems that are designed to unfold over time, to make us feel. I came to the arts through music. I was trained as a composer, and about 15 years ago, I started making pieces that were designed to look at the intersection between sound and image, to use an image to unveil a musical structure or to use a sound to show you something interesting about something that's usually pictorial.So what you're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn by the musical structure of the musicians onstage, and there's no accident that it looks like a plant, because the underlying algorithmic biology of the plant is what informed the musical structure in the first place. So once you know how to do this, once you know how to code with media, you can do some pretty cool stuff.This is a project I did for the Sundance Film Festival. Really simple idea: you take every Academy Award Best Picture, you speed it up to one minute each and string them all together. And so in 75 minutes, I can show you the history of Hollywood cinema. And what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema. So on the left, we've got Casablanca; on the right, we've got Chicago. And you can see that Casablanca is a little easier to read. That's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the 1940s was 26 seconds, and now it's around six seconds.This is a project that was inspired by some work that was funded by the US Federal Government in the early 2000s, to look at video footage and find a specific actor in any video. And so I repurposed this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner, which is Britney Spears. I downloaded 2,000 paparazzi photos of Britney Spears and trained my computer to find her face and her face alone. I can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes in the frame, and this sort of is a little double commentary about surveillance in our society. We are very fraught with anxiety about being watched, but then we obsess over celebrity.What you're seeing on the screen here is a collaboration I did with an artist named Li\u00e1n Amaris. What she did is very simple to explain and describe, but very hard to do. She took 72 minutes of activity, getting ready for a night out on the town, and stretched it over three days and performed it on a traffic island in slow motion in New York City. I was there, too, with a film crew. We filmed the whole thing, and then we reversed the process, speeding it up to 72 minutes again, so it looks like she's moving normally and the whole world is flying by.At a certain point, I figured out that what I was doing was making portraits. When you think about portraiture, you tend to think about stuff like this. The guy on the left is named Gilbert Stuart. He's sort of the first real portraitist of the United States. And on the right is his portrait of George Washington from 1796. This is the so-called Lansdowne portrait. And if you look at this painting, there's a lot of symbolism, right? We've got a rainbow out the window. We've got a sword. We've got a quill on the desk. All of these things are meant to evoke George Washington as the father of the nation.This is my portrait of George Washington. And this is an eye chart, only instead of letters, they're words. And what the words are is the 66 words in George Washington's State of the Union addresses that he uses more than any other president. So \"gentlemen\" has its own symbolism and its own rhetoric. And it's really kind of significant that that's the word he used the most. This is the eye chart for George W. Bush, who was president when I made this piece. And how you get there, from \"gentlemen\" to \"terror\" in 43 easy steps, tells us a lot about American history, and gives you a different insight than you would have looking at a series of paintings. These pieces provide a history lesson of the United States through the political rhetoric of its leaders. Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time talking about deficits. Bill Clinton spent a lot of time talking about the century in which he would no longer be president, but maybe his wife would be. Lyndon Johnson was the first President to give his State of the Union addresses on prime-time television; he began every paragraph with the word \"tonight.\" And Richard Nixon, or more accurately, his speechwriter, a guy named William Safire, spent a lot of time thinking about language and making sure that his boss portrayed a rhetoric of honesty.This project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures. It's an outdoor series of light boxes. And it's important to note that they're to scale, so if you stand 20 feet back and you can read between those two black lines, you have 20/20 vision.(Laughter)This is a portrait. And there's a lot of these. There's a lot of ways to do this with data. I started looking for a way to think about how I can do a more democratic form of portraiture, something that's more about my country and how it works. Every 10 years, we make a census in the United States. We literally count people, find out who lives where, what kind of jobs we've got, the language we speak at home. And this is important stuff \u2014 really important stuff. But it doesn't really tell us who we are. It doesn't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations.And so in 2010, I decided to make my own census. And I started looking for a corpus of data that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary Americans. And it turns out that there is such a corpus of data that's just sitting there for the taking. It's called online dating.So in 2010, I joined 21 different online dating services, as a gay man, a straight man, a gay woman and a straight woman, in every zip code in America and downloaded about 19 million people's dating profiles \u2014 about 20 percent of the adult population of the United States. I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is going to become really freaking obvious. Just go with me.(Laughter)So what I did was I sorted all this stuff by zip code. And I looked at word analysis. These are some dating profiles from 2010 with the word \"lonely\" highlighted. If you look at these things topographically, if you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word, you can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place. You can also see that Nebraska ain't that funny. This is the kinky map, so what this is showing you is that the women in Alaska need to get together with the men in southern New Mexico, and have a good time. And I have this at a pretty granular level, so I can tell you that the men in the eastern half of Long Island are way more interested in being spanked than men in the western half of Long Island. This will be your one takeaway from this whole conference. You're going to remember that fact for, like, 30 years.(Laughter)When you bring this down to a cartographic level, you can make maps and do the same trick I was doing with the eye charts. You can replace the name of every city in the United States with the word people use more in that city than anywhere else. If you've ever dated anyone from Seattle, this makes perfect sense. You've got \"pretty.\" You've got \"heartbreak.\" You've got \"gig.\" You've got \"cigarette.\" They play in a band and they smoke. And right above that you can see \"email.\" That's Redmond, Washington, which is the headquarters of the Microsoft Corporation. Some of these you can guess \u2014 so, Los Angeles is \"acting\" and San Francisco is \"gay.\" Some are a little bit more heartbreaking. In Baton Rouge, they talk about being curvy; downstream in New Orleans, they still talk about the flood. Folks in the American capital will say they're interesting. People in Baltimore, Maryland, will say they're afraid. This is New Jersey. I grew up somewhere between \"annoying\" and \"cynical.\"(Laughter) (Applause)And New York City's number one word is \"now,\" as in, \"Now I'm working as a waiter, but actually I'm an actor.\"(Laughter)Or, \"Now I'm a professor of engineering at NYU, but actually I'm an artist.\" If you go upstate, you see \"dinosaur.\" That's Syracuse. The best place to eat in Syracuse, New York, is a Hell's Angels barbecue joint called Dinosaur Barbecue. That's where you would take somebody on a date. I live somewhere between \"unconditional\" and \"midsummer,\" in Midtown Manhattan. And this is gentrified North Brooklyn, so you've got \"DJ\" and \"glamorous\" and \"hipsters\" and \"urbane.\" So that's maybe a more democratic portrait. And the idea was, what if we made red-state and blue-state maps based on what we want to do on a Friday night?This is a self-portrait. This is based on my email, about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years. You can think of this as a quantified selfie. So what I'm doing is running a physics equation based on my personal data. You have to imagine everybody I've ever corresponded with. It started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang. And everybody has gravity to one another, gravity based on how much they've been emailing, who they've been emailing with. And it also does sentimental analysis, so if I say \"I love you,\" you're heavier to me. And you attract to my email addresses in the middle, which act like mainline stars. And all the names are handwritten.Sometimes you do this data and this work with real-time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city. This is a Walther PPK 9mm semiautomatic handgun that was used in a shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans about two years ago on Valentine's Day in an argument over parking. Those are my cigarettes. This is the house where the shooting took place. This project involved a little bit of engineering. I've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft, with a computer driving it. That computer and the mechanism are buried in a box. The gun's on top welded to a steel plate. There's a wire going through to the trigger, and the computer in the box is online. It's listening to the 911 feed of the New Orleans Police Department, so that anytime there's a shooting reported in New Orleans,(Gunshot sound)the gun fires. Now, there's a blank, so there's no bullet. There's big light, big noise and most importantly, there's a casing. There's about five shootings a day in New Orleans, so over the four months this piece was installed, the case filled up with bullets. You guys know what this is \u2014 you call this \"data visualization.\" When you do it right, it's illuminating. When you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing. It reduces people to numbers. So watch out.One last piece for you. I spent the last summer as the artist in residence for Times Square. And Times Square in New York is literally the crossroads of the world. One of the things people don't notice about it is it's the most Instagrammed place on Earth. About every five seconds, someone commits a selfie in Times Square. That's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.(Laughter)These are some of them with their eyes centered.Every civilization, will use the maximum level of technology available to make art. And it's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture.So I leave you with this: we're more than numbers. We're people, and we have dreams and ideas. And reducing us to statistics is something that's done at our peril.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2487, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.842

society.\n\n00:03:17.654 --> 00:03:20.646\nWe are very fraught with anxiety\nabout being watched,\n\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.269\nbut then we obsess over celebrity.\n\n00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:27.907\nWhat you're seeing on the screen here\nis a collaboration I did\n\n00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.487\nwith an artist named Li\u00e1n Amaris.\n\n00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:34.385\nWhat she did is very simple\nto explain and describe,\n\n00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.641\nbut very hard to do.\n\n00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:38.516\nShe took 72 minutes of activity,\n\n00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.739\ngetting ready for a night out on the town,\n\n00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.852\nand stretched it over three days\n\n00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:47.464\nand performed it on a traffic island\nin slow motion in New York City.\n\n00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:50.126\nI was there, too, with a film crew.\n\n00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.402\nWe filmed the whole thing,\n\n00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:54.827\nand then we reversed the process,\nspeeding it up to 72 minutes again,\n\n00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:56.745\nso it looks like she's moving normally\n\n00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.601\nand the whole world is flying by.\n\n00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.625\nAt a certain point, I figured out\n\n00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.316\nthat what I was doing\nwas making portraits.\n\n00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:09.020\nWhen you think about portraiture,\nyou tend to think about stuff like this.\n\n00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:11.107\nThe guy on the left\nis named Gilbert Stuart.\n\n00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:14.195\nHe's sort of the first real portraitist\nof the United States.\n\n00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.444\nAnd on the right is his portrait\nof George Washington from 1796.\n\n00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:19.666\nThis is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.\n\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.930\nAnd if you look at this painting,\nthere's a lot of symbolism, right?\n\n00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:25.614\nWe've got a rainbow out the window.\nWe've got a sword.\n\n00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:27.093\nWe've got a quill on the desk.\n\n00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:28.966\nAll of these things are meant to evoke\n\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.438\nGeorge Washington\nas the father of the nation.\n\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.560\nThis is my portrait of George Washington.\n\n00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.743\nAnd this is an eye chart,\n\n00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.941\nonly instead of letters, they're words.\n\n00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:44.373\nAnd what the words are is the 66 words\n\n00:04:44.397 --> 00:04:46.857\nin George Washington's\nState of the Union addresses\n\n00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:49.252\nthat he uses more\nthan any other president.\n\n00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:54.180\nSo \"gentlemen\" has its own symbolism\nand its own rhetoric.\n\n00:04:54.204 --> 00:04:58.796\nAnd it's really kind of significant\nthat that's the word he used the most.\n\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.939\nThis is the eye chart for George W. Bush,\n\n00:05:00.963 --> 00:05:03.943\nwho was president when I made this piece.\n\n00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:05.135\nAnd how you get there,\n\n00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.611\nfrom \"gentlemen\" to \"terror\"\nin 43 easy steps,\n\n00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:10.695\ntells us a lot about American history,\n\n00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:12.306\nand gives you a different insight\n\n00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.267\nthan you would have\nlooking at a series of paintings.\n\n00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:19.225\nThese pieces provide a history lesson\nof the United States\n\n00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.505\nthrough the political\nrhetoric of its leaders.\n\n00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.493\nRonald Reagan spent a lot of time\ntalking about deficits.\n\n00:05:25.093 --> 00:05:26.658\nBill Clinton spent a lot of time\n\n00:05:26.682 --> 00:05:29.966\ntalking about the century in which\nhe would no longer be president,\n\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.601\nbut maybe his wife would be.\n\n00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:35.742\nLyndon Johnson was the first President\n\n00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:38.948\nto give his State of the Union addresses\non prime-time television;\n\n00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.312\nhe began every paragraph\nwith the word \"tonight.\"\n\n00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:44.002\nAnd Richard Nixon,\nor more accurately, his speechwriter,\n\n00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:45.354\na guy named William Safire,\n\n00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.426\nspent a lot of time\nthinking about language\n\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.383\nand making sure that his boss\nportrayed a rhetoric of honesty.\n\n00:05:51.407 --> 00:05:54.309\nThis project is shown\nas a series of monolithic sculptures.\n\n00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:56.781\nIt's an outdoor series of light boxes.\n\n00:05:56.805 --> 00:05:59.235\nAnd it's important to note\nthat they're to scale,\n\n00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.873\nso if you stand 20 feet back and you can\nread between those two black lines,\n\n00:06:02.897 --> 00:06:04.048\nyou have 20/20 vision.\n\n00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.110\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:05.134 --> 00:06:07.439\nThis is a portrait.\nAnd there's a lot of these.\n\n00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:10.725\nThere's a lot of ways\nto do this with data.\n\n00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:12.369\nI started looking for a way\n\n00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:17.098\nto think about how I can do\na more democratic form of portraiture,\n\n00:06:17.122 --> 00:06:21.353\nsomething that's more about\nmy country and how it works.\n\n00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:25.178\nEvery 10 years, we make a census\nin the United States.\n\n00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:26.660\nWe literally count people,\n\n00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:30.408\nfind out who lives where,\nwhat kind of jobs we've got,\n\n00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.909\nthe language we speak at home.\n\n00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.504\nAnd this is important stuff --\nreally important stuff.\n\n00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.761\nBut it doesn't really tell us who we are.\n\n00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:39.456\nIt doesn't tell us about our dreams\nand our aspirations.\n\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.870\nAnd so in 2010, I decided\nto make my own census.\n\n00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:46.214\nAnd I started looking for a corpus of data\n\n00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:49.350\nthat had a lot of descriptions\nwritten by ordinary Americans.\n\n00:06:49.374 --> 00:06:50.525\nAnd it turns out\n\n00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:52.291\nthat there is such a corpus of data\n\n00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:54.299\nthat's just sitting there for the taking.\n\n00:06:54.323 --> 00:06:55.649\nIt's called online dating.\n\n00:06:56.532 --> 00:07:01.478\nSo in 2010, I joined 21 different\nonline dating services,\n\n00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:04.602\nas a gay man, a straight man,\na gay woman and a straight woman,\n\n00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:06.243\nin every zip code in America\n\n00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:09.452\nand downloaded about\n19 million people's dating profiles --\n\n00:07:09.476 --> 00:07:12.708\nabout 20 percent of the adult population\nof the United States.\n\n00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.018\nI have obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n00:07:15.042 --> 00:07:18.143\nThis is going to become\nreally freaking obvious. Just go with me.\n\n00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:19.309\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:22.372\nSo what I did was I sorted\nall this stuff by zip code.\n\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.371\nAnd I looked at word analysis.\n\n00:07:25.395 --> 00:07:28.068\nThese are some dating profiles from 2010\n\n00:07:28.092 --> 00:07:30.187\nwith the word \"lonely\" highlighted.\n\n00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:33.192\nIf you look at these things\ntopographically,\n\n00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:36.716\nif you imagine dark colors to light colors\nare more use of the word,\n\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.041\nyou can see that Appalachia\nis a pretty lonely place.\n\n00:07:41.937 --> 00:07:46.884\nYou can also see\nthat Nebraska ain't that funny.\n\n00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:51.998\nThis is the kinky map,\nso what this is showing you\n\n00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:57.094\nis that the women in Alaska\nneed to get together\n\n00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:58.893\nwith the men in southern New Mexico,\n\n00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:00.257\nand have a good time.\n\n00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.147\nAnd I have this\nat a pretty granular level,\n\n00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:06.278\nso I can tell you that the men\nin the eastern half of Long Island\n\n00:08:06.302 --> 00:08:08.228\nare way more interested in being spanked\n\n00:08:08.252 --> 00:08:10.477\nthan men in the western half\nof Long Island.\n\n00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:14.659\nThis will be your one takeaway\nfrom this whole conference.\n\n00:08:14.683 --> 00:08:17.423\nYou're going to remember\nthat fact for, like, 30 years.\n\n00:08:17.447 --> 00:08:20.279\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:20.613 --> 00:08:23.036\nWhen you bring this down\nto a cartographic level,\n\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.514\nyou can make maps and do the same trick\nI was doing with the eye charts.\n\n00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:29.355\nYou can replace the name\nof every city in the United States\n\n00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:32.371\nwith the word people use more\nin that city than anywhere else.\n\n00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:35.624\nIf you've ever dated anyone\nfrom Seattle, this makes perfect sense.\n\n00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:38.350\nYou've got \"pretty.\"\nYou've got \"heartbreak.\"\n\n00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:40.789\nYou've got \"gig.\" You've got \"cigarette.\"\n\n00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:42.839\nThey play in a band and they smoke.\n\n00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:45.546\nAnd right above that you can see \"email.\"\n\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.876\nThat's Redmond, Washington,\n\n00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.495\nwhich is the headquarters\nof the Microsoft Corporation.\n\n00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:52.343\nSome of these you can guess --\nso, Los Angeles is \"acting\"\n\n00:08:52.367 --> 00:08:53.985\nand San Francisco is \"gay.\"\n\n00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:56.001\nSome are a little bit more heartbreaking.\n\n00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:58.106\nIn Baton Rouge, they talk\nabout being curvy;\n\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.017\ndownstream in New Orleans,\nthey still talk about the flood.\n\n00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.846\nFolks in the American capital\nwill say they're interesting.\n\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.647\nPeople in Baltimore, Maryland,\nwill say they're afraid.\n\n00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.208\nThis is New Jersey.\n\n00:09:08.232 --> 00:09:10.921\nI grew up somewhere\nbetween \"annoying\" and \"cynical.\"\n\n00:09:10.945 --> 00:09:15.184\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:17.865\nAnd New York City's\nnumber one word is \"now,\"\n\n00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:21.135\nas in, \"Now I'm working as a waiter,\nbut actually I'm an actor.\"\n\n00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.257\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:26.576\nOr, \"Now I'm a professor of engineering\nat NYU, but actually I'm an artist.\"\n\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.525\nIf you go upstate, you see \"dinosaur.\"\n\n00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:29.700\nThat's Syracuse.\n\n00:09:29.724 --> 00:09:31.797\nThe best place to eat\nin Syracuse, New York,\n\n00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.615\nis a Hell's Angels barbecue joint\ncalled Dinosaur Barbecue.\n\n00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:36.861\nThat's where you would\ntake somebody on a date.\n\n00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:40.691\nI live somewhere between \"unconditional\"\nand \"midsummer,\" in Midtown Manhattan.\n\n00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:42.762\nAnd this is gentrified North Brooklyn,\n\n00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:45.982\nso you've got \"DJ\" and \"glamorous\"\nand \"hipsters\" and \"urbane.\"\n\n00:09:46.006 --> 00:09:48.428\nSo that's maybe\na more democratic portrait.\n\n00:09:48.452 --> 00:09:51.521\nAnd the idea was, what if we made\nred-state and blue-state maps\n\n00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:53.714\nbased on what we want to do\non a Friday night?\n\n00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:55.245\nThis is a self-portrait.\n\n00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:56.985\nThis is based on my email,\n\n00:09:57.009 --> 00:09:59.978\nabout 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.\n\n00:10:00.002 --> 00:10:02.955\nYou can think of this\nas a quantified selfie.\n\n00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:06.073\nSo what I'm doing is running\na physics equation\n\n00:10:06.097 --> 00:10:07.495\nbased on my personal data.\n\n00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:10.262\nYou have to imagine everybody\nI've ever corresponded with.\n\n00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:13.685\nIt started out in the middle\nand it exploded with a big bang.\n\n00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:15.887\nAnd everybody has gravity to one another,\n\n00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:18.172\ngravity based on how much\nthey've been emailing,\n\n00:10:18.196 --> 00:10:19.704\nwho they've been emailing with.\n\n00:10:19.728 --> 00:10:21.560\nAnd it also does sentimental analysis,\n\n00:10:21.584 --> 00:10:23.873\nso if I say \"I love you,\"\nyou're heavier to me.\n\n00:10:23.897 --> 00:10:26.393\nAnd you attract to my email\naddresses in the middle,\n\n00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.512\nwhich act like mainline stars.\n\n00:10:28.536 --> 00:10:30.321\nAnd all the names are handwritten.\n\n00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:34.583\nSometimes you do this data\nand this work with real-time data\n\n00:10:34.607 --> 00:10:37.554\nto illuminate a specific problem\nin a specific city.\n\n00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:40.705\nThis is a Walther PPK 9mm\nsemiautomatic handgun\n\n00:10:40.729 --> 00:10:43.760\nthat was used in a shooting\nin the French Quarter of New Orleans\n\n00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:47.093\nabout two years ago on Valentine's Day\nin an argument over parking.\n\n00:10:47.117 --> 00:10:48.332\nThose are my cigarettes.\n\n00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.631\nThis is the house\nwhere the shooting took place.\n\n00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:53.029\nThis project involved\na little bit of engineering.\n\n00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.268\nI've got a bike chain\nrigged up as a cam shaft,\n\n00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:56.608\nwith a computer driving it.\n\n00:10:56.632 --> 00:10:59.398\nThat computer and the mechanism\nare buried in a box.\n\n00:10:59.422 --> 00:11:01.636\nThe gun's on top welded to a steel plate.\n\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.005\nThere's a wire going\nthrough to the trigger,\n\n00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:06.220\nand the computer in the box is online.\n\n00:11:06.244 --> 00:11:09.477\nIt's listening to the 911 feed\nof the New Orleans Police Department,\n\n00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:12.378\nso that anytime there's a shooting\nreported in New Orleans,\n\n00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:13.403\n(Gunshot sound)\n\n00:11:13.427 --> 00:11:14.647\nthe gun fires.\n\n00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.608\nNow, there's a

00:11:24.806\nThere's about five shootings\na day in New Orleans,\n\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.171\nso over the four months\nthis piece was installed,\n\n00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:28.806\nthe case filled

illuminating.\n\n00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:38.985\nWhen you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.\n\n00:11:39.614 --> 00:11:41.269\nIt reduces people to numbers.\n\n00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:42.704\nSo watch out.\n\n00:11:44.612 --> 00:11:45.968\nOne last piece for you.\n\n00:11:46.424 --> 00:11:49.206\nI spent the last summer\nas the artist in residence\n\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.446\nfor Times Square.\n\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.533\nAnd Times Square in New York\nis literally the crossroads of the world.\n\n00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:56.734\nOne of the things\npeople don't notice about it\n\n00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:59.305\nis it's the most Instagrammed\nplace on Earth.\n\n00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.743\nAbout every five seconds,\nsomeone commits a selfie\n\n00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:03.936\nin Times Square.\n\n00:12:04.382 --> 00:12:07.631\nThat's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.\n\n00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:08.740\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:08.764 --> 00:12:11.056\nThese are some of them\nwith their eyes centered.\n\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.141\nEvery civilization,\n\n00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:15.066\nwill use the maximum level\nof technology available to make art.\n\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.898\nAnd it's the responsibility\nof the artist to ask questions\n\n00:12:17.922 --> 00:12:19.553\nabout what that technology means\n\n00:12:19.577 --> 00:12:21.596\nand how it reflects our culture.\n\n00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.106\nSo I leave you with this:\nwe're more than numbers.\n\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.131\nWe're people, and we have\ndreams and ideas.\n\n00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:28.954\nAnd reducing us to statistics\nis something that's done\n\n00:12:28.978 --> 00:12:30.229\nat our peril.\n\n00:12:30.253 --> 00:12:31.431\nThank you very

This is my first trip, first time in life I'm outside of the walls of Gaza. I'm so happy to be here.(Applause)My ambition always was to be a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel free to fly the sky, to touch the sky. But that didn't happen. Simply, I live in Gaza, there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is just to look up to the sky. On some days, we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes. Sometimes we make food, too.My job in Gaza is to arrange everything for journalists who come to my homeland to tell the stories about what's going on in Gaza. Many mornings, I had to go to the border area to collect a journalist. If anything should happen to the journalist, or if the journalist decides to cover a story the government doesn't want us to cover, bad things could happen.Navigating through my country helping journalists, filmmakers, news crews, is my working life. I believe my success comes from building a relationship not only with journalists and the news crews, but also with the communities in the Gaza Strip. These communities who don't want their stories to be told, I never looked to them as stories or numbers. But like me, they are human beings.I have built up many relationships over 10 years. And guess what? This gives me the chance to get access to people, to stories that others can't. In some certain situations, I feel, as a woman, I have more power. Many male journalists in my society, they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country. That problem started when the Gaza tunnel was being built. With the siege on Gaza, tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food, building material, other stuff we needed. But not anymore, because the Egyptian side flooded them up with water and they are not working anymore. Drugs were being smuggled, and many young people got addicted, too. In the tradition of the Palestinian society, it's forbidden for men to enter the household. So, no male journalists get the story. But I did.I have a wonderful husband, a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society. He's at home now with my two kids, and I have another one that's growing in here.(Applause)When I'm working, I call him every two hours, and he knows if he doesn't hear from me, he should call my contact, the one who gives me access to the story, which is the one who I trust.One of the times in Gaza, during the kidnapping of the British journalist Alan Johnston, I was asked by an American magazine to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did. The journalist covering the story and I were asked to meet outside of his hotel. They came, they picked us up in a black van with black windows, they were wearing masks on that day. And they drove us away, far away in the middle of a field. They took our cell phones and we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field. I was so scared that day, a day I will never forget.So, why do I do what I do? I do it because I believe if I didn't, a huge part of the story about Gaza will be missing. There are some more stories I could tell you about my country. And not all of them are bad. I love my country, despite the terrible situation we live in \u2014 siege, poverty, unemployment \u2014 but there is life. There are people who are dreamers and amazing people full of energy. We have wonderful music, and a great music school. We have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes. And Gaza is the only place in the Arab world where Muslims and Christians live in strong brotherhood.(Applause)During the time of war, the hardest part for me is leaving the house early in the morning, leaving my children. I take a picture of them everyday because I never know if I will make it back to them. Being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in Gaza. But when I hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing, I just head straight toward it, because I want to be there first, because these stories should be told.When my children were small and we heard the sound of the war, I used to tell them that they were fireworks. Now they are older, they understand. I do have terrible nightmares because of all that I witnessed during war times, especially these lifeless bodies of young children. I still remember a little girl, her name is Hala. She's the only survivor from her family. Her picture will be with me forever. I will never forget her.I'm proud that I can stand here and be here today with you. I'm proud that I can tell you stories, sad and happy, stories about my small corner of the world, Gaza. I'm proud that I am the first female fixer working in Gaza. And the funny thing is they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.(Laughter)I hope one day, I will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women, all other amazing women I know in my country. I hope that one day I can help other women in my country to be fixers like me. And of course sometimes, I feel I can't do this work anymore, it's just too much for me. But I remember these words: \"Don't limit your challenge, but challenge your limit. Don't allow others to stand in front of your dreams.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2488, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.942 -->

I come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making and someone that wonders how history will judge us.One day, this ring that belonged to my grandfather will pass to my son, Charlie. And I wonder what his generation and perhaps the one that follows will make of the two lives this ring has worked.My grandfather was a coal miner. In his time, burning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop was accepted. We know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces. But today, I fear it's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harshly because of its impact on the climate \u2014 more harshly than my grandfather's industry, even.I work, of course, in the banking industry, which will be remembered for its crisis in 2008 \u2014 a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments away from some really, really important promises, like promises made at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels and transition to using cleaner energy. That promise is already in jeopardy. And that's a real problem, because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen sooner rather than later.Firstly, because greenhouse gases, once released, stay in the atmosphere for decades. And secondly, if a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today, it's going to be way more costly to change later on. So for the climate, history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the wrong time. The story need not be this gloomy, though.Three years ago, I argued that governments could use the tools deployed to save the financial system to meet other global challenges. And these arguments are getting stronger, not weaker, with time. Let's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like.When the financial crisis hit in 2008, the central banks of the US and UK began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as \"quantitative easing.\" Depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature, this is money printing by another name. And boy, did they print. The US alone created four trillion dollars' worth of its own currency. This was not done in isolation. In a remarkable act of cooperation, the 188 countries that make up the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, agreed to issue 250 billion dollars' worth of their own currency \u2014 the Special Drawing Right \u2014 to boost reserves around the world.When the financial crisis moved to Europe, the European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi, promised \"to do whatever it takes.\" And they did. The Bank of Japan repeated those words \u2014 that exact same commitment \u2014 to do \"whatever it takes\" to reflate their economy. In both cases, \"whatever it takes\" meant trillions of dollars more in money-printing policies that continue today. What this shows is that when faced with some global challenges, policy makers are able to act collectively, with urgency, and run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing.So, let's go back to that original question: Can we print money for climate finance? Three years ago, the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo. Once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource, governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people to print more and more money for other causes: education, health care, welfare \u2014 even defense.And there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing \u2014 uncontrolled money printing \u2014 leading to hyperinflation. Think: Weimar Republic in 1930; Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008, when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day. But all of this is moving the public debate forward, so much so, that money printing for the people is now discussed openly in the financial media, and even in some political manifestos.But it's important the debate doesn't stop here, with printing national currencies. Because climate change is a shared global problem, there are some really compelling reasons why we should be printing that international currency that's issued by the IMF, to fund it. The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is the IMF's electronic unit of account that governments use to transfer funds amongst each other. Think of it as a peer-to-peer payment network, like Bitcoin, but for governments.And it's truly global. Each of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas as part of their foreign exchange reserves. These are national stores of wealth that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises. And that global nature is why, at the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the IMF issued those extra 250 billion dollars \u2014 because it served as a collective global action that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop.But here \u2014 here's the intriguing part. More than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009 \u2014 150 billion dollars' worth \u2014 went to developed market countries who, for the most part, have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves, because they have flexible exchange rates. So those extra reserves that were printed in 2009, in the end, for developed market countries at least, weren't really needed. And they remain unused today.So here's an idea. As a first step, why don't we start spending those unused, those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009, to combat climate change?They could, for example, be used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund. This was a fund created in 2009, following that climate agreement in Copenhagen. And it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries to meet their climate projects. It's been one of the most successful funds of its type, raising almost 10 billion dollars. But if we use those extra SDRs that were issued, it helps governments get back on track, to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis.It could also \u2014 it could also serve as a test case. If the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign, it could be used to justify the additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years, again, with the commitment that developed-market countries would direct their share of the new reserves to the Green Climate Fund.Printing international money in this way has several advantages over printing national currencies. The first is it's really easy to argue that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone. No one section of society benefits from the printing press over another. That problem of competing claims is mitigated. It's also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra SDRs, it's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control. What you end up with is a collective, global action aimed \u2014 and it's controlled global action \u2014 aimed at a global good. And, as we've learned with the money-printing schemes, whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules.So, for example, the issuance of these extra SDRs every five years could be capped, such that this international currency is never more than five percent of global foreign exchange reserves. That's important because it would allay well, let's say, the ridiculous concerns that the US might have that the SDR could ever challenge the dollar's dominant role in international finance. And in fact, I think the only thing that the SDR would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme is its nickname, the \"greenback.\" Because even with that cap in place, the IMF could have followed up its issuance \u2014 its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 \u2014 with a further 200 billion dollars of SDRs in 2014.So hypothetically, that would mean that developed countries could have contributed up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs to the Green Climate Fund. That's 30 times what it has today. And you know, as spectacular as that sounds, it's only just beginning to look like \"whatever it takes.\"And just to think what amazing things could be done with that money, consider this: in 2009, Norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil if they followed through on their goals on deforestation. That program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation in the past decade. That's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads for three whole years. So what could we do with 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that, organized on a global scale? We could take cars off the roads for a generation.So, let's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change. The real question is: Do we care enough about future generations to take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system? After all, we could do it, we did do it and we are doing it today.We must, must, must do \"whatever it takes.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2489, "subtitle":

00:08:19.194\nIt's been one of the most\nsuccessful funds of its type,\n\n00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:21.522\nraising almost 10 billion dollars.\n\n00:08:21.546 --> 00:08:24.984\nBut if we use those extra\nSDRs that were issued,\n\n00:08:25.008 --> 00:08:28.320\nit helps governments get back on track,\n\n00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:31.167\nto meet that promise\nof 100 billion dollars a year\n\n00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:33.781\nthat was derailed by the financial crisis.\n\n00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.632\nIt could also --\n\n00:08:37.656 --> 00:08:40.302\nit could also serve as a test case.\n\n00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:47.413\nIf the inflationary consequences\nof using SDRs in this way are benign,\n\n00:08:48.432 --> 00:08:50.387\nit could be used to justify\n\n00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:55.145\nthe additional, extra issuance\nof SDRs, say, every five years,\n\n00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:57.564\nagain, with the commitment\n\n00:08:57.588 --> 00:09:02.018\nthat developed-market countries\nwould direct their share\n\n00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.503\nof the new reserves\n\n00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:05.320\nto the Green Climate Fund.\n\n00:09:07.034 --> 00:09:10.758\nPrinting international money\nin this way has several advantages\n\n00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:12.843\nover printing national currencies.\n\n00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:16.273\nThe first is it's really easy to argue\n\n00:09:16.297 --> 00:09:20.714\nthat spending money to mitigate\nclimate change benefits everyone.\n\n00:09:21.324 --> 00:09:25.183\nNo one section of society benefits\nfrom the printing press over another.\n\n00:09:25.207 --> 00:09:28.991\nThat problem of competing\nclaims is mitigated.\n\n00:09:29.421 --> 00:09:30.761\nIt's also fair to say\n\n00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:35.912\nthat because it takes so many countries\nto agree to issue these extra SDRs,\n\n00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:40.139\nit's highly unlikely that money printing\nwould get out of control.\n\n00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:45.983\nWhat you end up with\nis a collective, global action\n\n00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:50.170\naimed -- and it's controlled\nglobal action --\n\n00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:52.783\naimed at a global good.\n\n00:09:53.595 --> 00:09:54.803\nAnd,\n\n00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:57.394\nas we've learned\nwith the money-printing schemes,\n\n00:09:57.418 --> 00:10:00.250\nwhatever concerns we have\ncan be allayed by rules.\n\n00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:02.597\nSo, for example,\n\n00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:07.594\nthe issuance of these extra SDRs\nevery five years could be capped,\n\n00:10:07.618 --> 00:10:13.213\nsuch that this international currency\nis never more than five percent\n\n00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:15.199\nof global foreign exchange reserves.\n\n00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:17.764\nThat's important because it would allay\n\n00:10:17.788 --> 00:10:21.684\nwell, let's say, the ridiculous\nconcerns that the US might have\n\n00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:26.230\nthat the SDR could ever challenge\nthe dollar's dominant role\n\n00:10:26.254 --> 00:10:27.850\nin international finance.\n\n00:10:28.172 --> 00:10:29.955\nAnd in fact,\n\n00:10:29.979 --> 00:10:33.373\nI think the only thing that the SDR\nwould likely steal from the dollar\n\n00:10:33.397 --> 00:10:34.866\nunder this scheme\n\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.361\nis its nickname, the \"greenback.\"\n\n00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:42.301\nBecause even with that cap in place,\n\n00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:45.789\nthe IMF could have\nfollowed up its issuance --\n\n00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:48.861\nits massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --\n\n00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:53.877\nwith a further 200 billion\ndollars of SDRs in 2014.\n\n00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:57.008\nSo hypothetically,\n\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.128\nthat would mean that developed countries\ncould have contributed\n\n00:11:01.152 --> 00:11:05.673\nup to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs\n\n00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.347\nto the Green Climate Fund.\n\n00:11:08.144 --> 00:11:11.604\nThat's 30 times what it has today.\n\n00:11:11.628 --> 00:11:12.784\nAnd you know,\n\n00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:14.649\nas spectacular as that sounds,\n\n00:11:15.538 --> 00:11:19.728\nit's only just beginning to look\nlike \"whatever it takes.\"\n\n00:11:21.087 --> 00:11:24.405\nAnd just to think what amazing things\ncould be done with that money,\n\n00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:25.640\nconsider this:\n\n00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:28.204\nin 2009,\n\n00:11:28.228 --> 00:11:32.966\nNorway promised one billion dollars\nof its reserves to Brazil\n\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.653\nif they followed through\non their goals on deforestation.\n\n00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:44.850\nThat program has since delivered\na 70 percent reduction in deforestation\n\n00:11:44.874 --> 00:11:46.285\nin the past decade.\n\n00:11:46.884 --> 00:11:51.222\nThat's saving 3.2 billion tons\nof carbon dioxide emissions,\n\n00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:55.777\nwhich is the equivalent of taking\nall American cars off the roads\n\n00:11:55.801 --> 00:11:58.087\nfor three whole years.\n\n00:11:59.662 --> 00:12:00.964\nSo what could we do\n\n00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:06.032\nwith 300 other pay-for-performance\nclimate projects like that,\n\n00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:08.935\norganized on a global scale?\n\n00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:12.762\nWe could take cars off the roads\nfor a generation.\n\n00:12:13.342 --> 00:12:14.492\nSo,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:20.241\nlet's not quibble about whether we can\nafford to fund climate change.\n\n00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:23.083\nThe real question is:\n\n00:12:23.107 --> 00:12:26.504\nDo we care enough about future generations\n\n00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:31.569\nto take the very same policy risks\nwe took to save the financial system?\n\n00:12:32.181 --> 00:12:33.379\nAfter all,\n\n00:12:34.207 --> 00:12:35.426\nwe could do it,\n\n00:12:36.242 --> 00:12:37.393\nwe did do it\n\n00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:39.148\nand we are doing it today.\n\n00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:44.084\nWe must, must, must do\n\"whatever it takes.\"\n\n00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:46.535\nThank you.\n\n00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:50.925\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to read the genome and build a human being", "duration": "928", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/riccardo_sabatini_how_to_read_the_genome_and_build_a_human_being", "transcript": "For the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey that is probably the biggest dream of humanity: to understand the code of life.So for me, everything started many, many years ago when I met the first 3D printer. The concept was fascinating. A 3D printer needs three elements: a bit of information, some raw material, some energy, and it can produce any object that was not there before.I was doing physics, I was coming back home and I realized that I actually always knew a 3D printer. And everyone does. It was my mom.(Laughter)My mom takes three elements: a bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case, raw elements and energy in the same media, that is food, and after several months, produces me. And I was not existent before.So apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3D printer, I immediately got mesmerized by that piece, the first one, the information. What amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human? Is it much? Is it little? How many thumb drives can you fill?Well, I was studying physics at the beginning and I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece. So, imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here, a carbon here, a nitrogen here. So in the first approximation, if I can list the number of atoms that compose a human being, I can build it. Now, you can run some numbers and that happens to be quite an astonishing number. So the number of atoms, the file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby, will actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives \u2014 multiplied 2,000 times. This is the miracle of life. Every time you see from now on a pregnant lady, she's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter. Forget big data, forget anything you heard of. This is the biggest amount of information that exists.(Applause)But nature, fortunately, is much smarter than a young physicist, and in four billion years, managed to pack this information in a small crystal we call DNA. We met it for the first time in 1950 when Rosalind Franklin, an amazing scientist, a woman, took a picture of it. But it took us more than 40 years to finally poke inside a human cell, take out this crystal, unroll it, and read it for the first time. The code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet, four letters: A, T, C and G. And to build a human, you need three billion of them. Three billion. How many are three billion? It doesn't really make any sense as a number, right?So I was thinking how I could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is. But there is \u2014 I mean, I'm going to have some help, and the best person to help me introduce the code is actually the first man to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter. So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.(Applause)Not the man in the flesh, but for the first time in history, this is the genome of a specific human, printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter: 262,000 pages of information, 450 kilograms, shipped from the United States to Canada thanks to Bruno Bowden, Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything. It was an amazing feat.But this is the visual perception of what is the code of life. And now, for the first time, I can do something fun. I can actually poke inside it and read. So let me take an interesting book ... like this one. I have an annotation; it's a fairly big book. So just to let you see what is the code of life. Thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of letters. And they apparently make sense. Let's get to a specific part. Let me read it to you:(Laughter)\"AAG, AAT, ATA.\"To you it sounds like mute letters, but this sequence gives the color of the eyes to Craig. I'll show you another part of the book. This is actually a little more complicated.Chromosome 14, book 132:(Laughter)As you might expect.(Laughter)\"ATT, CTT, GATT.\"This human is lucky, because if you miss just two letters in this position \u2014 two letters of our three billion \u2014 he will be condemned to a terrible disease: cystic fibrosis. We have no cure for it, we don't know how to solve it, and it's just two letters of difference from what we are.A wonderful book, a mighty book, a mighty book that helped me understand and show you something quite remarkable. Every one of you \u2014 what makes me, me and you, you \u2014 is just about five million of these, half a book. For the rest, we are all absolutely identical. Five hundred pages is the miracle of life that you are. The rest, we all share it. So think about that again when we think that we are different. This is the amount that we share.So now that I have your attention, the next question is: How do I read it? How do I make sense out of it? Well, for however good you can be at assembling Swedish furniture, this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life.(Laughter)And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters, Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself, decided to assemble a new company. Human Longevity was born, with one mission: trying everything we can try and learning everything we can learn from these books, with one target \u2014 making real the dream of personalized medicine, understanding what things should be done to have better health and what are the secrets in these books.An amazing team, 40 data scientists and many, many more people, a pleasure to work with. The concept is actually very simple. We're going to use a technology called machine learning. On one side, we have genomes \u2014 thousands of them. On the other side, we collected the biggest database of human beings: phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR \u2014 everything you can think of. Inside there, on these two opposite sides, there is the secret of translation. And in the middle, we build a machine. We build a machine and we train a machine \u2014 well, not exactly one machine, many, many machines \u2014 to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype. What are those letters, and what do they do? It's an approach that can be used for everything, but using it in genomics is particularly complicated. Little by little we grew and we wanted to build different challenges. We started from the beginning, from common traits. Common traits are comfortable because they are common, everyone has them.So we started to ask our questions: Can we predict height? Can we read the books and predict your height? Well, we actually can, with five centimeters of precision. BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle, but we still can, we get in the ballpark, eight kilograms of precision. Can we predict eye color? Yeah, we can. Eighty percent accuracy. Can we predict skin color? Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy. Can we predict age? We can, because apparently, the code changes during your life. It gets shorter, you lose pieces, it gets insertions. We read the signals, and we make a model.Now, an interesting challenge: Can we predict a human face? It's a little complicated, because a human face is scattered among millions of these letters. And a human face is not a very well-defined object. So, we had to build an entire tier of it to learn and teach a machine what a face is, and embed and compress it. And if you're comfortable with machine learning, you understand what the challenge is here.Now, after 15 years \u2014 15 years after we read the first sequence \u2014 this October, we started to see some signals. And it was a very emotional moment. What you see here is a subject coming in our lab. This is a face for us. So we take the real face of a subject, we reduce the complexity, because not everything is in your face \u2014 lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life. We symmetrize the face, and we run our algorithm. The results that I show you right now, this is the prediction we have from the blood.(Applause)Wait a second. In these seconds, your eyes are watching, left and right, left and right, and your brain wants those pictures to be identical. So I ask you to do another exercise, to be honest. Please search for the differences, which are many. The biggest amount of signal comes from gender, then there is age, BMI, the ethnicity component of a human. And scaling up over that signal is much more complicated. But what you see here, even in the differences, lets you understand that we are in the right ballpark, that we are getting closer. And it's already giving you some emotions.This is another subject that comes in place, and this is a prediction. A little smaller face, we didn't get the complete cranial structure, but still, it's in the ballpark. This is a subject that comes in our lab, and this is the prediction. So these people have never been seen in the training of the machine. These are the so-called \"held-out\" set. But these are people that you will probably never believe. We're publishing everything in a scientific publication, you can read it.But since we are onstage, Chris challenged me. I probably exposed myself and tried to predict someone that you might recognize. So, in this vial of blood \u2014 and believe me, you have no idea what we had to do to have this blood now, here \u2014 in this vial of blood is the amount of biological information that we need to do a full genome sequence. We just need this amount. We ran this sequence, and I'm going to do it with you. And we start to layer up all the understanding we have. In the vial of blood, we predicted he's a male. And the subject is a male. We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm. The subject is a meter and 77 cm. So, we predicted that he's 76; the subject is 82. We predict his age, 38. The subject is 35. We predict his eye color. Too dark. We predict his skin color. We are almost there. That's his face.Now, the reveal moment: the subject is this person.(Laughter)And I did it intentionally. I am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity. Southern European, Italians \u2014 they never fit in models. And it's particular \u2014 that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model. But there is another point. So, one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome. It's our free will, it's how I look. Not my haircut in this case, but my beard cut. So I'm going to show you, I'm going to, in this case, transfer it \u2014 and this is nothing more than Photoshop, no modeling \u2014 the beard on the subject. And immediately, we get much, much better in the feeling.So, why do we do this? We certainly don't do it for predicting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood. We do it because the same technology and the same approach, the machine learning of this code, is helping us to understand how we work, how your body works, how your body ages, how disease generates in your body, how your cancer grows and develops, how drugs work and if they work on your body.This is a huge challenge. This is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world. It's called personalized medicine. It's the ability to move from a statistical approach where you're a dot in the ocean, to a personalized approach, where we read all these books and we get an understanding of exactly how you are. But it is a particularly complicated challenge, because of all these books, as of today, we just know probably two percent: four books of more than 175.And this is not the topic of my talk, because we will learn more. There are the best minds in the world on this topic. The prediction will get better, the model will get more precise. And the more we learn, the more we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before about life, about death, about parenting.So, we are touching the very inner detail on how life works. And it's a revolution that cannot be confined in the domain of science or technology. This must be a global conversation. We must start to think of the future we're building as a humanity. We need to interact with creatives, with artists, with philosophers, with politicians. Everyone is involved, because it's the future of our species. Without fear, but with the understanding that the decisions that we make in the next year will change the course of history forever.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2490, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.332\nFor the next 16 minutes,\nI'm going to take you on a journey\n\n00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:18.442\nthat is probably\nthe biggest dream of humanity:\n\n00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.481\nto understand the code of life.\n\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.773\nSo for me, everything started\nmany, many years ago\n\n00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:26.520\nwhen I met the first 3D printer.\n\n00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:28.218\nThe concept was fascinating.\n\n00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:30.264\nA 3D printer needs three elements:\n\n00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:34.422\na bit of information, some\nraw material, some energy,\n\n00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:37.780\nand it can produce any object\nthat was not there before.\n\n00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.612\nI was doing physics,\nI was coming back home\n\n00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:44.074\nand I realized that I actually\nalways knew a 3D printer.\n\n00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:45.434\nAnd everyone does.\n\n00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:46.616\nIt was my mom.\n\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.641\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:50.079\nMy mom takes three elements:\n\n00:00:50.103 --> 00:00:54.076\na bit of information, which is between\nmy father and my mom in this case,\n\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.257\nraw elements and energy\nin the same media, that is food,\n\n00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:00.789\nand after several months, produces me.\n\n00:01:00.813 --> 00:01:02.625\nAnd I was not existent before.\n\n00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.411\nSo apart from the shock of my mom\ndiscovering that she was a 3D printer,\n\n00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:11.173\nI immediately got mesmerized\nby that piece,\n\n00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:12.914\nthe first one, the information.\n\n00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:15.189\nWhat amount of information does it take\n\n00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:17.149\nto build and assemble a human?\n\n00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:18.747\nIs it much?

happens to be\nquite an astonishing number.\n\n00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:53.214\nSo the number of atoms,\n\n00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:57.993\nthe file that I will save in my thumb\ndrive to assemble a little baby,\n\n00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:02.684\nwill actually fill an entire Titanic\nof thumb drives --\n\n00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:05.426\nmultiplied 2,000 times.\n\n00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:09.316\nThis is the miracle of life.\n\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.952\nEvery time you see from now on\na pregnant lady,\n\n00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:14.832\nshe's assembling the biggest\namount of information\n\n00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:16.412\nthat you will ever encounter.\n\n00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.386\nForget big data, forget\nanything you heard of.\n\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.291\nThis is the biggest amount\nof information that exists.\n\n00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:26.148\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:26.172 --> 00:02:30.816\nBut nature, fortunately, is much smarter\nthan a young physicist,\n\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.416\nand in four billion years, managed\nto pack this information\n\n00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.145\nin a small crystal we call DNA.\n\n00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:41.875\nWe met it for the first time in 1950\nwhen Rosalind Franklin,\n\n00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.455\nan amazing scientist, a woman,\n\n00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.868\ntook a picture of it.\n\n00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:50.080\nBut it took us more than 40 years\nto finally poke inside a human cell,\n\n00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.706\ntake out this crystal,\n\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.810\nunroll it, and read it for the first time.\n\n00:02:55.573 --> 00:02:58.814\nThe code comes out to be\na fairly simple alphabet,\n\n00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:02.610\nfour letters: A, T, C and G.\n\n00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:06.124\nAnd to build a human,\nyou need three billion of them.\n\n00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:08.070\nThree billion.\n\n00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:09.673\nHow many are three billion?\n\n00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:12.459\nIt doesn't really make\nany sense as a number, right?\n\n00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:16.568\nSo I was thinking how\nI could explain myself better\n\n00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:19.642\nabout how big and enormous this code is.\n\n00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.720\nBut there is -- I mean,\nI'm going to have some help,\n\n00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.971\nand the best person to help me\nintroduce the code\n\n00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:29.517\nis actually the first man\nto sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.\n\n00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:32.931\nSo welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.\n\n00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:39.886\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.166\nNot the man in the flesh,\n\n00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:45.751\nbut for the first time in history,\n\n00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:49.237\nthis is the genome of a specific human,\n\n00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:53.021\nprinted page-by-page, letter-by-letter:\n\n00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:57.041\n262,000 pages of information,\n\n00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:01.429\n450 kilograms, shipped\nfrom the United States to Canada\n\n00:04:01.453 --> 00:04:06.296\nthanks to Bruno Bowden,\nLulu.com, a start-up, did everything.\n\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.783\nIt was an amazing feat.\n\n00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:12.104\nBut this is the visual perception\nof what is the code of life.\n\n00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:14.606\nAnd now, for the first time,\nI can do something fun.\n\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.177\nI can actually poke inside it and read.\n\n00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:21.826\nSo let me take an interesting\nbook ... like this one.\n\n00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.569\nI have an annotation;\nit's a fairly big book.\n\n00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:31.320\nSo just to let you see\nwhat is the code of life.\n\n00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:35.915\nThousands and thousands and thousands\n\n00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.609\nand millions of letters.\n\n00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:41.029\nAnd they apparently make sense.\n\n00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.810\nLet's get to a specific part.\n\n00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:44.891\nLet me read it to you:\n\n00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:45.936\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.966\n\"AAG, AAT, ATA.\"\n\n00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.990\nTo you it sounds like mute letters,\n\n00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:57.055\nbut this sequence gives\nthe color of the eyes to Craig.\n\n00:04:57.591 --> 00:04:59.523\nI'll show you another part of the book.\n\n00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:01.641\nThis is actually a little\nmore complicated.\n\n00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:05.588\nChromosome 14, book 132:\n\n00:05:05.612 --> 00:05:07.702\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.003\nAs you might expect.\n\n00:05:09.027 --> 00:05:12.493\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:19.322\n\"ATT, CTT, GATT.\"\n\n00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:21.974\nThis human is lucky,\n\n00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:26.515\nbecause if you miss just\ntwo letters in this position --\n\n00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.416\ntwo letters of our three billion --\n\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.459\nhe will be condemned\nto a terrible disease:\n\n00:05:30.483 --> 00:05:31.923\ncystic fibrosis.\n\n00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:35.360\nWe have no cure for it,\nwe don't know how to solve it,\n\n00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:39.139\nand it's just two letters\nof difference from what we are.\n\n00:05:39.543 --> 00:05:42.248\nA wonderful book, a mighty book,\n\n00:05:43.073 --> 00:05:45.071\na mighty book that helped me understand\n\n00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.848\nand show you something quite remarkable.\n\n00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:52.873\nEvery one of you -- what makes\nme, me and you, you --\n\n00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:55.851\nis just about five million of these,\n\n00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.103\nhalf a book.\n\n00:05:57.973 --> 00:05:59.636\nFor the rest,\n\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.222\nwe are all absolutely identical.\n\n00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:06.984\nFive hundred pages\nis the miracle of life that you are.\n\n00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:09.539\nThe rest, we all share it.\n\n00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:12.472\nSo think about that again\nwhen we think that we are different.\n\n00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:14.717\nThis is the amount that we share.\n\n00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.828\nSo now that I have your attention,\n\n00:06:18.852 --> 00:06:20.211\nthe next question is:\n\n00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:21.386\nHow do I read it?\n\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.919\nHow do I make sense out of it?\n\n00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:27.607\nWell, for however good you can be\nat assembling Swedish furniture,\n\n00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:31.194\nthis instruction manual\nis nothing you can crack in your life.\n\n00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:32.821\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:35.957\nAnd so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,\n\n00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:38.521\nPeter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,\n\n00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:40.472\ndecided to assemble a new company.\n\n00:06:40.496 --> 00:06:41.908\nHuman Longevity was born,\n\n00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:43.302\nwith one mission:\n\n00:06:43.326 --> 00:06:45.187\ntrying everything we can try\n\n00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:47.970\nand learning everything\nwe can learn from these books,\n\n00:06:47.994 --> 00:06:49.699\nwith one target --\n\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.621\nmaking real the dream\nof personalized medicine,\n\n00:06:53.645 --> 00:06:57.412\nunderstanding what things\nshould be done to have better health\n\n00:06:57.436 --> 00:06:59.719\nand what are the secrets in these books.\n\n00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:04.537\nAn amazing team, 40 data scientists\nand many, many more people,\n\n00:07:04.561 --> 00:07:05.911\na pleasure to work with.\n\n00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:08.188\nThe concept is actually very simple.\n\n00:07:08.212 --> 00:07:11.370\nWe're going to use a technology\ncalled machine learning.\n\n00:07:11.394 --> 00:07:15.933\nOn one side, we have genomes --\nthousands of them.\n\n00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:19.954\nOn the other side, we collected\nthe biggest database of human beings:\n\n00:07:19.978 --> 00:07:24.274\nphenotypes, 3D scan, NMR --\neverything you can think of.\n\n00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:27.197\nInside there, on these two opposite sides,\n\n00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:29.663\nthere is the secret of translation.\n\n00:07:29.687 --> 00:07:32.159\nAnd in the middle, we build a machine.\n\n00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.144\nWe build a machine\nand we train a machine --\n\n00:07:35.168 --> 00:07:38.378\nwell, not exactly one machine,\nmany, many machines --\n\n00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:42.946\nto try to understand and translate\nthe genome in a phenotype.\n\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.660\nWhat are those letters,\nand what do they do?\n\n00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:49.431\nIt's an approach that can\nbe used for everything,\n\n00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:52.448\nbut using it in genomics\nis particularly complicated.\n\n00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.748\nLittle by little we grew and we wanted\nto build different challenges.\n\n00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:58.504\nWe started from the beginning,\nfrom common traits.\n\n00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:01.131\nCommon traits are comfortable\nbecause they are common,\n\n00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:02.339\neveryone has them.\n\n00:08:02.363 --> 00:08:04.857\nSo we started to ask our questions:\n\n00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:06.261\nCan we predict height?\n\n00:08:06.943 --> 00:08:09.120\nCan we read the books\nand predict your height?\n\n00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:10.295\nWell, we actually can,\n\n00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.112\nwith five centimeters of precision.\n\n00:08:12.136 --> 00:08:15.271\nBMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,\n\n00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:19.159\nbut we still can, we get in the ballpark,\neight kilograms of precision.\n\n00:08:19.183 --> 00:08:20.414\nCan we predict eye color?\n\n00:08:20.438 --> 00:08:21.596\nYeah, we can.\n\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.944\nEighty percent accuracy.\n\n00:08:23.424 --> 00:08:25.282\nCan we predict skin color?\n\n00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.747\nYeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.\n\n00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.111\nCan we predict age?\n\n00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:33.818\nWe can, because apparently,\nthe code changes during your life.\n\n00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:37.124\nIt gets shorter, you lose pieces,\nit gets insertions.\n\n00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:39.703\nWe read the signals, and we make a model.\n\n00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:41.871\nNow, an interesting challenge:\n\n00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:43.624\nCan we predict a human face?\n\n00:08:44.972 --> 00:08:46.250\nIt's a little complicated,\n\n00:08:46.274 --> 00:08:49.465\nbecause a human face is scattered\namong millions of these letters.\n\n00:08:49.489 --> 00:08:52.118\nAnd a human face is not\na very well-defined object.\n\n00:08:52.142 --> 00:08:54.193\nSo, we had to build an entire tier of it\n\n00:08:54.217 --> 00:08:56.927\nto learn and teach\na machine what a face is,\n\n00:08:56.951 --> 00:08:58.988\nand embed and compress it.\n\n00:08:59.012 --> 00:09:01.260\nAnd if you're comfortable\nwith machine learning,\n\n00:09:01.284 --> 00:09:03.568\nyou understand what the challenge is here.\n\n00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:10.057\nNow, after 15 years -- 15 years after\nwe read the first sequence --\n\n00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:12.983\nthis October, we started\nto see some signals.\n\n00:09:13.007 --> 00:09:15.462\nAnd it was a very emotional moment.\n\n00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:19.231\nWhat you see here is a subject\ncoming in our lab.\n\n00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:21.505\nThis is a face for us.\n\n00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:25.160\nSo we take the real face of a subject,\nwe reduce the complexity,\n\n00:09:25.184 --> 00:09:27.154\nbecause not everything is in your face --\n\n00:09:27.178 --> 00:09:30.964\nlots of features and defects\nand asymmetries come from your life.\n\n00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:34.457\nWe symmetrize the face,\nand we run our algorithm.\n\n00:09:35.203 --> 00:09:37.101\nThe results that I show you right now,\n\n00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:40.497\nthis is the prediction we have\nfrom the blood.\n\n00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:43.078\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:43.102 --> 00:09:44.537\nWait a second.\n\n00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:49.253\nIn these seconds, your eyes are watching,\nleft and right, left and right,\n\n00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:53.207\nand your brain wants\nthose pictures to be identical.\n\n00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:55.677\nSo I ask you to do\nanother exercise, to be honest.\n\n00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:57.988\nPlease search for the differences,\n\n00:09:58.012 --> 00:09:59.373\nwhich are many.\n\n00:09:59.397 --> 00:10:02.000\nThe biggest amount of signal\ncomes from gender,\n\n00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:07.225\nthen there is age, BMI,\nthe ethnicity component of a human.\n\n00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:10.960\nAnd scaling up over that signal\nis much more complicated.\n\n00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:14.234\nBut what you see here,\neven in the differences,\n\n00:10:14.258 --> 00:10:17.853\nlets you understand\nthat we are in the right ballpark,\n\n00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:19.225\nthat we are getting closer.\n\n00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:21.598\nAnd it's already giving you some emotions.\n\n00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:24.325\nThis is another subject\nthat comes in place,\n\n00:10:24.349 --> 00:10:25.758\nand this is a prediction.\n\n00:10:25.782 --> 00:10:30.378\nA little smaller face, we didn't get\nthe complete cranial structure,\n\n00:10:30.402 --> 00:10:33.053\nbut still, it's in the ballpark.\n\n00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:35.816\nThis is a subject that comes in our lab,\n\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.283\nand this is the prediction.\n\n00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:42.690\nSo these people have never been seen\nin the training of the machine.\n\n00:10:42.714 --> 00:10:45.551\nThese are the so-called \"held-out\" set.\n\n00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:49.315\nBut these are people that you will\nprobably never believe.\n\n00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:52.015\nWe're publishing everything\nin a scientific publication,\n\n00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:53.190\nyou can read it.\n\n00:10:53.214 --> 00:10:55.558\nBut since we are onstage,\nChris challenged me.\n\n00:10:55.582 --> 00:10:59.208\nI probably exposed myself\nand tried to predict\n\n00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:02.063\nsomeone that you might recognize.\n\n00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:06.853\nSo, in this vial of blood --\nand believe me, you have no idea\n\n00:11:06.877 --> 00:11:09.757\nwhat we had to do to have\nthis blood now, here --\n\n00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:13.682\nin this vial of blood is the amount\nof biological information\n\n00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.983\nthat we need to do a full genome sequence.\n\n00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:18.077\nWe just need this amount.\n\n00:11:18.486 --> 00:11:21.691\nWe ran this sequence,\nand I'm going to do it with you.\n\n00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:25.694\nAnd we start to layer up\nall the understanding we have.\n\n00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.068\nIn the vial of blood,\nwe predicted he's a male.\n\n00:11:29.092 --> 00:11:30.456\nAnd the subject is a male.\n\n00:11:30.954 --> 00:11:33.392\nWe predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.\n\n00:11:33.416 --> 00:11:35.808\nThe subject is a meter and 77 cm.\n\n00:11:35.832 --> 00:11:39.942\nSo, we predicted that he's 76;\nthe subject is 82.\n\n00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:43.291\nWe predict his age, 38.\n\n00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:45.219\nThe subject is 35.\n\n00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:47.933\nWe predict his eye color.\n\n00:11:48.782 --> 00:11:49.993\nToo dark.\n\n00:11:50.017 --> 00:11:51.572\nWe predict his skin color.\n\n00:11:51.984 --> 00:11:53.394\nWe are almost there.\n\n00:11:53.857 --> 00:11:55.230\nThat's his face.\n\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.399\nNow, the reveal moment:\n\n00:12:00.423 --> 00:12:02.193\nthe subject is this person.\n\n00:12:02.217 --> 00:12:04.152\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:06.234\nAnd I did it intentionally.\n\n00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:09.950\nI am a very particular\nand peculiar ethnicity.\n\n00:12:09.974 --> 00:12:12.924\nSouthern European, Italians --\nthey never fit in models.\n\n00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:18.078\nAnd it's particular -- that ethnicity\nis a complex corner case for our model.\n\n00:12:18.102 --> 00:12:19.611\nBut there is another point.\n\n00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:23.112\nSo, one of the things that we use\na lot to recognize people\n\n00:12:23.136 --> 00:12:24.858\nwill never be written in the genome.\n\n00:12:24.882 --> 00:12:27.199\nIt's our free will, it's how I look.\n\n00:12:27.223 --> 00:12:30.452\nNot my haircut in this case,\nbut my beard cut.\n\n00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:34.029\nSo I'm going to show you, I'm going to,\nin this case, transfer it --\n\n00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:36.818\nand this is nothing more\nthan Photoshop, no modeling --\n\n00:12:36.842 --> 00:12:38.555\nthe beard on the subject.\n\n00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:42.051\nAnd immediately, we get\nmuch, much better in the feeling.\n\n00:12:42.913 --> 00:12:45.622\nSo, why do we do this?\n\n00:12:47.896 --> 00:12:53.036\nWe certainly don't do it\nfor predicting height\n\n00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.432\nor taking a beautiful picture\nout of your blood.\n\n00:12:56.348 --> 00:13:00.366\nWe do it because the same technology\nand the same approach,\n\n00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.910\nthe machine learning of this code,\n\n00:13:02.934 --> 00:13:06.071\nis helping us to understand how we work,\n\n00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:07.581\nhow your body works,\n\n00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:09.270\nhow your body ages,\n\n00:13:09.294 --> 00:13:12.063\nhow disease generates in your body,\n\n00:13:12.087 --> 00:13:15.059\nhow your cancer grows and develops,\n\n00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:16.866\nhow drugs work\n\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.204\nand if they work on your body.\n\n00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:21.338\nThis is a huge challenge.\n\n00:13:21.852 --> 00:13:23.490\nThis is a challenge that we share\n\n00:13:23.514 --> 00:13:26.093\nwith thousands of other\nresearchers around the world.\n\n00:13:26.117 --> 00:13:28.339\nIt's called personalized medicine.\n\n00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:32.543\nIt's the ability to move\nfrom a statistical approach\n\n00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:34.599\nwhere you're a dot in the ocean,\n\n00:13:34.623 --> 00:13:36.436\nto a personalized approach,\n\n00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.645\nwhere we read all these books\n\n00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:41.533\nand we get an understanding\nof exactly how you are.\n\n00:13:42.218 --> 00:13:45.580\nBut it is a particularly\ncomplicated challenge,\n\n00:13:45.604 --> 00:13:49.602\nbecause of all these books, as of today,\n\n00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:52.268\nwe just know probably two percent:\n\n00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:56.638\nfour books of more than 175.\n\n00:13:57.979 --> 00:14:01.185\nAnd this is not the topic of my talk,\n\n00:14:02.103 --> 00:14:04.701\nbecause we will learn more.\n\n00:14:05.336 --> 00:14:08.005\nThere are the best minds\nin the world on this topic.\n\n00:14:09.006 --> 00:14:10.840\nThe prediction will get better,\n\n00:14:10.864 --> 00:14:13.117\nthe model will get more precise.\n\n00:14:13.141 --> 00:14:14.999\nAnd the more we learn,\n\n00:14:15.023 --> 00:14:19.853\nthe more we will\nbe confronted with decisions\n\n00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:22.898\nthat we never had to face before\n\n00:14:22.922 --> 00:14:24.357\nabout life,\n\n00:14:24.381 --> 00:14:26.055\nabout death,\n\n00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:27.682\nabout parenting.\n\n00:14:32.584 --> 00:14:37.330\nSo, we are touching the very\ninner detail on how life works.\n\n00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:41.234\nAnd it's a revolution\nthat cannot be confined\n\n00:14:41.258 --> 00:14:43.917\nin the domain of science or technology.\n\n00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:47.162\nThis must be a global conversation.\n\n00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:52.973\nWe must start to think of the future\nwe're building as a humanity.\n\n00:14:52.997 --> 00:14:57.061\nWe need to interact with creatives,\nwith artists, with philosophers,\n\n00:14:57.085 --> 00:14:58.595\nwith politicians.\n\n00:14:58.619 --> 00:14:59.777\nEveryone is involved,\n\n00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:02.626\nbecause it's the future of our species.\n\n00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:07.199\nWithout fear, but with the understanding\n\n00:15:07.223 --> 00:15:11.094\nthat the decisions\nthat we make in the next year\n\n00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:14.907\nwill change the course of history forever.\n\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.850\nThank you.\n\n00:15:16.874 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_gray_how_my_son_s_short_life_made_a_lasting_difference", "transcript": "I was three months pregnant with twins when my husband Ross and I went to my second sonogram.I was 35 years old at the time, and I knew that that meant we had a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect. So, Ross and I researched the standard birth defects, and we felt reasonably prepared.Well, nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face. The doctor explained that one of our twins, Thomas, had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly. This means that his brain was not formed correctly because part of his skull was missing. Babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero or within a few minutes, hours or days of being born. But the other twin, Callum, appeared to be healthy, as far as the doctor could tell, and these twins were identical, genetically identical.So after a lot of questions about how this could have possibly happened, a selective reduction was mentioned, and while this procedure was not impossible, it posed some unique risks for the healthy twin and for me, so we decided to carry the pregnancy to term. So there I was, three months pregnant, with two trimesters ahead of me, and I had to find a way to manage my blood pressure and my stress. And it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months. But I stared down the barrel of that gun for so long that I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. While there was nothing we could do to prevent the tragedy, I wanted to find a way for Thomas's brief life to have some kind of positive impact.So I asked my nurse about organ, eye and tissue donation. She connected with our local organ-procurement organization, the Washington Regional Transplant Community. WRTC explained to me that Thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant, and I was shocked: I didn't even know you could be rejected for that. But they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research. This helped me see Thomas in a new light. As opposed to just a victim of a disease, I started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery.On March 23, 2010, the twins were born, and they were both born alive. And just like the doctor said, Thomas was missing the top part of his skull, but he could nurse, drink from a bottle, cuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby, and he slept in our arms. After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms surrounded by our family.We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home and brought him to Children's National Medical Center. A few hours later, we got a call to say that the recovery was a success, and Thomas's donations would be going to four different places. His cord blood would go to Duke University. His liver would go to a cell-therapy company called Cytonet in Durham. His corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute, which is part of Harvard Medical School, and his retinas would go to the University of Pennsylvania.A few days later, we had a funeral with our immediate family, including baby Callum, and we basically closed this chapter in our lives. But I did find myself wondering, what's happening now? What are the researchers learning? And was it even worthwhile to donate?WRTC invited Ross and I to a grief retreat, and we met about 15 other grieving families who had donated their loved one's organs for transplant. Some of them had even received letters from the people who received their loved one's organs, saying thank you. I learned that they could even meet each other if they'd both sign a waiver, almost like an open adoption. And I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter or I could get a letter and learn about what happened. But I was disappointed to learn that this process only exists for people who donate for transplant. So I was jealous. I had transplant envy, I guess.(Laughter)But over the years that followed, I learned a lot more about donation, and I even got a job in the field.And I came up with an idea. I wrote a letter that started out, \"Dear Researcher.\" I explained who I was, and I asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas in March of 2010, and I asked if my family could visit their lab. I emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation, the Old Dominion Eye Foundation, and asked if they could send it to the right person. They said that they had never done this before, and they couldn't guarantee a response, but they wouldn't be an obstacle, and they would deliver it.Two days later, I got a response from Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University of Pennsylvania. She thanked me for the donation, and she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma, which is a deadly cancer of the retina that affects children under the age of five, and she said that yes, we were invited to visit her lab.So next we talked on the phone, and one of the first things she said to me was that she couldn't possibly imagine how we felt, and that Thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice, and that she seemed to feel indebted to us. So I said, \"Nothing against your study, but we didn't actually pick it. We donated to the system, and the system chose your study. I said, \"And second of all, bad things happen to children every day, and if you didn't want these retinas, they would probably be buried in the ground right now. So to be able to participate in your study gives Thomas's life a new layer of meaning. So, never feel guilty about using this tissue.\"Next, she explained to me how rare it was. She had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the National Disease Research Interchange. She got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria, and it was Thomas's.Next, we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab, and we chose March 23, 2015, which was the twins' fifth birthday. After we hung up, I emailed her some pictures of Thomas and Callum, and a few weeks later, we received this T-shirt in the mail.A few months later, Ross, Callum and I piled in the car and we went for a road trip. We met Arupa and her staff, and Arupa said that when I told her not to feel guilty, that it was a relief, and that she hadn't seen it from our perspective. She also explained that Thomas had a secret code name. The same way Henrietta Lacks is called HeLa, Thomas was called RES 360. RES means research, and 360 means he was the 360th specimen over the course of about 10 years.She also shared with us a unique document, and it was the shipping label that sent his retinas from DC to Philadelphia. This shipping label is like an heirloom to us now. It's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be.Arupa also explained that she is using Thomas's retina and his RNA to try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation, and she even showed us some results that were based on RES 360. Then she took us to the freezer and she showed us the two samples that she still has that are still labeled RES 360. There's two little ones left. She said she saved it because she doesn't know when she might get more. After this, we went to the conference room and we relaxed and we had lunch together, and the lab staff presented Callum with a birthday gift. It was a child's lab kit. And they also offered him an internship.(Laughter)So in closing, I have two simple messages today. One is that most of us probably don't think about donating to research. I know I didn't. I think I'm a normal person. But I did it. It was a good experience, and I recommend it, and it brought my family a lot of peace. And second is if you work with human tissue and you wonder about the donor and about the family, write them a letter. Tell them you received it, tell them what you're working on, and invite them to visit your lab, because that visit may be even more gratifying for you than it is for them. And I'd also like to ask you a favor. If you're ever successful in arranging one of these visits, please tell me about it.The other part of my family's story is that we ended up visiting all four facilities that received Thomas's donations. And we met amazing people doing inspiring work. The way I see it now is that Thomas got into Harvard, Duke and Penn \u2014(Laughter)And he has a job at Cytonet, and he has colleagues and he has coworkers who are in the top of their fields. And they need him in order to do their job. And a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital, everlasting and relevant. And I only hope that my life can be as relevant.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2492, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:16.229\nI was three

00:03:31.788\nand Thomas's donations\nwould be going to four different places.\n\n00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:34.513\nHis cord blood would go\nto Duke University.\n\n00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:39.181\nHis liver would go to a cell-therapy\ncompany called Cytonet in Durham.\n\n00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:43.466\nHis corneas would go\nto Schepens Eye Research Institute,\n\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.649\nwhich is part of Harvard Medical School,\n\n00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:48.529\nand his retinas would go\nto the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:53.969\nA few days later, we had a funeral\nwith our immediate family,\n\n00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:55.937\nincluding baby Callum,\n\n00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:59.275\nand we basically\nclosed this chapter in our lives.\n\n00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:02.592\nBut I did find myself wondering,\nwhat's happening now?\n\n00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:04.680\nWhat are the researchers learning?\n\n00:04:05.088 --> 00:04:07.381\nAnd was it even worthwhile to donate?\n\n00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:12.699\nWRTC invited Ross and I\nto a grief retreat,\n\n00:04:12.723 --> 00:04:15.476\nand we met about\n15 other grieving families\n\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.127\nwho had donated their loved one's\norgans for transplant.\n\n00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.853\nSome of them had even received letters\n\n00:04:21.877 --> 00:04:24.846\nfrom the people who received\ntheir loved one's organs,\n\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.035\nsaying thank you.\n\n00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:29.185\nI learned that they\ncould even meet each other\n\n00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:30.647\nif they'd both sign a waiver,\n\n00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:32.067\nalmost like an open adoption.\n\n00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:35.704\nAnd I was so excited,\nI thought maybe I could write a letter\n\n00:04:35.728 --> 00:04:38.337\nor I could get a letter\nand learn about what happened.\n\n00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.900\nBut I was disappointed to learn\n\n00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:43.094\nthat this process only exists\nfor people who donate for transplant.\n\n00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:46.380\nSo I was jealous.\nI had transplant envy, I guess.\n\n00:04:46.404 --> 00:04:47.554\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:49.958\nBut over the years that followed,\n\n00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:52.458\nI learned a lot more about donation,\n\n00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:54.560\nand I even got a job in the field.\n\n00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:55.997\nAnd I came up with an idea.\n\n00:04:57.837 --> 00:04:59.496\nI wrote a letter that started out,\n\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.686\n\"Dear Researcher.\"\n\n00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:04.276\nI explained who I was,\n\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.168\nand I asked if they could tell me\nwhy they requested infant retinas\n\n00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:10.427\nin March of 2010,\n\n00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:12.720\nand I asked if my family\ncould visit their lab.\n\n00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:17.007\nI emailed it to the eye bank\nthat arranged the donation,\n\n00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:19.409\nthe Old Dominion Eye Foundation,\n\n00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:21.925\nand asked if they could\nsend it to the right person.\n\n00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:24.584\nThey said that they had\nnever done this before,\n\n00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:26.497\nand they couldn't guarantee a response,\n\n00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.337\nbut they wouldn't be an obstacle,\nand they would deliver it.\n\n00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:32.655\nTwo days later, I got a response\n\n00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:35.663\nfrom Dr. Arupa Ganguly\nof the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:38.197\nShe thanked me for the donation,\n\n00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:40.944\nand she explained\nthat she is studying retinoblastoma,\n\n00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:42.785\nwhich is a deadly cancer of the retina\n\n00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.935\nthat affects children\nunder the age of five,\n\n00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.649\nand she said that yes,\nwe were invited to visit her lab.\n\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.212\nSo next we talked on the phone,\n\n00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:52.283\nand one of the first things she said to me\n\n00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:55.138\nwas that she couldn't possibly\nimagine how we felt,\n\n00:05:55.162 --> 00:05:57.902\nand that Thomas had given\nthe ultimate sacrifice,\n\n00:05:57.926 --> 00:06:00.013\nand that she seemed\nto feel indebted to us.\n\n00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:03.793\nSo I said, \"Nothing against your study,\n\n00:06:03.817 --> 00:06:05.483\nbut we didn't actually pick it.\n\n00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:08.665\nWe donated to the system,\nand the system chose your study.\n\n00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:14.341\nI said, \"And second of all,\nbad things happen to children every day,\n\n00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:16.153\nand if you didn't want these retinas,\n\n00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:18.707\nthey would probably\nbe buried in the ground right now.\n\n00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:22.097\nSo to be able to participate in your study\n\n00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:25.764\ngives Thomas's life\na new layer of meaning.\n\n00:06:25.788 --> 00:06:28.732\nSo, never feel guilty\nabout using this tissue.\"\n\n00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:32.337\nNext, she explained to me how rare it was.\n\n00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.057\nShe had placed a request\nfor this tissue six years earlier\n\n00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:38.294\nwith the National Disease\nResearch Interchange.\n\n00:06:39.118 --> 00:06:42.452\nShe got only one sample of tissue\nthat fit her criteria,\n\n00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:43.681\nand it was Thomas's.\n\n00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:48.646\nNext, we arranged a date for me\nto come visit the lab,\n\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.320\nand we chose March 23, 2015,\nwhich was the twins' fifth birthday.\n\n00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:58.457\nAfter we hung up, I emailed her\nsome pictures of Thomas and Callum,\n\n00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:01.370\nand a few weeks later,\nwe received this T-shirt in the mail.\n\n00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.899\nA few months later, Ross, Callum\nand I piled in the car\n\n00:07:05.923 --> 00:07:07.514\nand we went for a road trip.\n\n00:07:07.538 --> 00:07:10.102\nWe met Arupa and her staff,\n\n00:07:10.126 --> 00:07:14.374\nand Arupa said that when I told her\nnot to feel guilty, that it was a relief,\n\n00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:16.699\nand that she hadn't seen it\nfrom our perspective.\n\n00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:22.286\nShe also explained that Thomas\nhad a secret code name.\n\n00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.258\nThe same way Henrietta Lacks\nis called HeLa,\n\n00:07:26.282 --> 00:07:28.908\nThomas was called RES 360.\n\n00:07:29.352 --> 00:07:30.750\nRES means research,\n\n00:07:30.774 --> 00:07:34.274\nand 360 means he was the 360th specimen\n\n00:07:34.298 --> 00:07:36.083\nover the course of about 10 years.\n\n00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:41.234\nShe also shared with us a unique document,\n\n00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:43.743\nand it was the shipping label\n\n00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:47.251\nthat sent his retinas\nfrom DC to Philadelphia.\n\n00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:51.620\nThis shipping label\nis like an heirloom to us now.\n\n00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:55.770\nIt's the same way that a military medal\nor a wedding certificate might be.\n\n00:07:56.645 --> 00:08:02.045\nArupa also explained that she is using\nThomas's retina and his RNA\n\n00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:05.479\nto try to inactivate the gene\nthat causes tumor formation,\n\n00:08:05.503 --> 00:08:08.613\nand she even showed us some results\nthat were based on RES 360.\n\n00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:11.751\nThen she took us to the freezer\n\n00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:15.210\nand she showed us the two samples\nthat she still has\n\n00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:17.556\nthat are still labeled RES 360.\n\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.440\nThere's two little ones left.\n\n00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:20.992\nShe said she saved it\n\n00:08:21.016 --> 00:08:23.344\nbecause she doesn't know\nwhen she might get more.\n\n00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:26.559\nAfter this, we went to the conference room\n\n00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:29.193\nand we relaxed and we had lunch together,\n\n00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:33.487\nand the lab staff presented Callum\nwith a birthday gift.\n\n00:08:34.137 --> 00:08:35.780\nIt was a child's lab kit.\n\n00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:38.765\nAnd they also offered him an internship.\n\n00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.972\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:45.146\nSo in closing, I have two\nsimple messages today.\n\n00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:49.340\nOne is that most of us probably\ndon't think about donating to research.\n\n00:08:49.364 --> 00:08:52.474\nI know I didn't.\nI think I'm a normal person.\n\n00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:53.649\nBut I did it.\n\n00:08:53.673 --> 00:08:55.815\nIt was a good experience,\nand I recommend it,\n\n00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:57.783\nand it brought my family a lot of peace.\n\n00:08:57.807 --> 00:09:00.592\nAnd second is if you work\nwith human tissue\n\n00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:03.211\nand you wonder about the donor\nand about the family,\n\n00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:04.430\nwrite them a letter.\n\n00:09:04.454 --> 00:09:07.270\nTell them you received it,\ntell them what you're working on,\n\n00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:08.961\nand invite them to visit your lab,\n\n00:09:08.985 --> 00:09:11.510\nbecause that visit may be\neven more gratifying for you\n\n00:09:11.534 --> 00:09:12.765\nthan it is for them.\n\n00:09:12.789 --> 00:09:14.551\nAnd I'd also like to ask you a favor.\n\n00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:17.534\nIf you're ever successful\nin arranging one of these visits,\n\n00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:18.876\nplease tell me about it.\n\n00:09:20.022 --> 00:09:21.718\nThe other part of my family's story\n\n00:09:21.742 --> 00:09:24.054\nis that we ended up visiting\nall four facilities\n\n00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:26.140\nthat received Thomas's donations.\n\n00:09:26.164 --> 00:09:29.088\nAnd we met amazing people\ndoing inspiring work.\n\n00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:35.062\nThe way I see it now\nis that Thomas got into Harvard,\n\n00:09:35.086 --> 00:09:37.252\nDuke and Penn --\n\n00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.601\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:42.993\nAnd he has a job at Cytonet,\n\n00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:45.802\nand he has colleagues and he has coworkers\n\n00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:47.587\nwho are in the top of their fields.\n\n00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:50.182\nAnd they need him\nin order to do their job.\n\n00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:55.746\nAnd a life that once seemed\nbrief and insignificant\n\n00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:01.452\nrevealed itself to be vital,\neverlasting and relevant.\n\n00:10:02.182 --> 00:10:04.729\nAnd I only hope that my life\ncan be as relevant.\n\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.621\nThank you.\n\n00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:16.373\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Pirates, nurses and other rebel designers", "duration": "704", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/alice_rawsthorn_pirates_nurses_and_other_rebel_designers", "transcript": "Design is a slippery and elusive phenomenon, which has meant different things at different times. But all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common: they began with a dream. And the bolder the dream, the greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it. And this is why the greatest designers are almost always the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades.This has been the case throughout history, all the way back to the year 300 BC, when a 13-year-old became the king of a remote, very poor and very small Asian country. He dreamt of acquiring land, riches and power through military conquest. And his design skills \u2014 improbable though it sounds \u2014 would be essential in enabling him to do so.At the time, all weapons were made by hand to different specifications. So if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle, they wouldn't necessarily be able to fire another archer's arrows from their bow. This of course meant that they would be less effective in combat and very vulnerable, too. Ying solved this problem by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically, so they were interchangeable. And he did the same for daggers, axes, spears, shields and every other form of weaponry. His formidably equipped army won batter after battle, and within 15 years, his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger, richer, more powerful neighbors, to found the mighty Chinese Empire.Now, no one, of course, would have thought of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time \u2014 why would they? And yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively but with tremendous ingenuity to achieve his ends. And so did another equally improbable, accidental designer, who was also not above using violence to get what he wanted. This was Edward Teach, better known as the British pirate, Blackbeard.This was the golden age of piracy, where pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas. Colonial trade was flourishing, and piracy was highly profitable. And the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils, they needed to attack their enemies so brutally that they would surrender on sight. So in other words, they could take the ships without wasting ammunition, or incurring casualties.So Edward Teach redesigned himself as Blackbeard by playing the part of a merciless brute. He wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height. He grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face. He slung braces of pistols on either shoulder. He even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight, so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack. And like many pirates of that era, he flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones, because those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries, that their meaning was instantly recognizable, even in the lawless, illiterate world of the high seas: surrender or you'll suffer. So of course, all his sensible victims surrendered on sight.Put like that, it's easy to see why Edward Teach and his fellow pirates could be seen as pioneers of modern communications design, and why their deadly symbol \u2014(Laughter)there's more \u2014 why their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones was a precursor of today's logos, rather like the big red letters standing behind me, but of course with a different message.(Laughter)Yet design was also used to nobler ends by an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer, the 19th-century British nurse, Florence Nightingale. Her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone. Nightingale was born into a rather grand, very wealthy British family, who were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals during the Crimean War. Once there, she swiftly realized that more patients were dying of infections that they caught there, in the filthy, fetid wards, than they were of battle wounds. So she campaigned for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics to be designed and built.Back in Britain, she mounted another campaign, this time for civilian hospitals, and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them. The Nightingale ward, as it is called, dominated hospital design for decades to come, and elements of it are still used today. But by then, design was seen as a tool of the Industrial Age. It was formalized and professionalized, but it was restricted to specific roles and generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals rather than being used intuitively, as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done.By the 20th century, this commercial ethos was so powerful, that any designers who deviated from it risked being seen as cranks or subversives.Now among them is one of my great design heroes, the brilliant L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy. He was the Hungarian artist and designer whose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life were so powerful that they still influence the design of the digital images we see on our phone and computer screens. He radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany, and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him when he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later. Moholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever, but his approach to design was too experimental, as was his insistence on seeing it, as he put it, as an attitude, not a profession to be in tune with the times.And sadly, the same applied to another design maverick: Richard Buckminster Fuller. He was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist, who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society in such a forward-thinking way that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism in design in the 1920s. Now he, despite his efforts, was routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment, and admittedly, some of his experiments failed, like the flying car that never got off the ground. And yet, the geodesic dome, his design formula to build an emergency shelter from scraps of wood, metal, plastic, bits of tree, old blankets, plastic sheeting \u2014 just about anything that's available at the time \u2014 is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design, and has provided sorely needed refuge to many, many people in desperate circumstances ever since.Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers like Bucky and Moholy that drew me to design. I began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent. I wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs, and I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields. But I picked design, because I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life.Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.(Applause)And greatly as I admire the achievements of professional designers, which have been extraordinary and immense, I also believe that design benefits hugely from the originality, the lateral thinking and the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades. And we're living at a remarkable moment in design, because this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together. Because even very basic advances in digital technology have enabled them to operate increasingly independently, in or out of a commercial context, to pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives.So in theory, basic platforms like crowdfunding, cloud computing, social media are giving greater freedom to professional designers and giving more resources for the improvisational ones, and hopefully, a more receptive response to their ideas.Now, some of my favorite examples of this are in Africa, where a new generation of designers are developing incredible Internet of Things technologies to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream of improving healthcare in countries where more people now have access to cell phones than to clean, running water.And among them is Arthur Zang. He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer who has a adapted a tablet computer into the Cardiopad, a mobile heart-monitoring device. It can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote, rural areas. The data is then sent on a cellular network to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis. And if any problems are spotted by the specialists there, a suitable course of treatment is recommended. And this of course saves many patients from making long, arduous, expensive and often pointless journeys to those hospitals, and makes it much, much likelier that their hearts will actually be checked.Arthur Zang started working on the Cardiopad eight years ago, in his final year at university. But he failed to persuade any conventional sources to give him investment to get the project off the ground. He posted the idea on Facebook, where a Cameroonian government official saw it and managed to secure a government grant for him. He's now developing not only the Cardiopad, but other mobile medical devices to treat different conditions.And he isn't alone, because there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers who are also pursuing extraordinary projects of their own. And I'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them. One is Peek Vision. This is a group of doctors and designers in Kenya, who've developed an Internet of Things technology of their own, as a portable eye examination kit. Then there's Gabriel Maher, who is developing a new design language to enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities, without recourse to traditional stereotypes.All of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams, by the making the most of their newfound freedom, with the discipline of professional designers and the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades. And we all stand to benefit.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2493, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.855\nDesign is a slippery\nand elusive phenomenon,\n\n00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.140\nwhich has meant different\nthings at different times.\n\n00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:23.432\nBut all truly inspiring design projects\nhave one thing in common:\n\n00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.282\nthey began with a dream.\n\n00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:27.075\nAnd the bolder the dream,\n\n00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.740\nthe greater the design feat\nthat will be required to achieve it.\n\n00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.658\nAnd this is why the greatest\ndesigners are almost always\n\n00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:38.370\nthe biggest dreamers\nand rebels and renegades.\n\n00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:41.528\nThis has been the case throughout history,\n\n00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:45.473\nall the way back to the year 300 BC,\n\n00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:48.616\nwhen a 13-year-old became the king\n\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.083\nof a remote, very poor\nand very small Asian country.\n\n00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:56.918\nHe dreamt of acquiring land,\nriches and power\n\n00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:58.609\nthrough military conquest.\n\n00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.016\nAnd his design skills --\n\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.863\nimprobable though it sounds --\n\n00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:04.932\nwould be essential\nin enabling him to do so.\n\n00:01:05.563 --> 00:01:06.713\nAt the time,\n\n00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:10.147\nall weapons were made by hand\nto different specifications.\n\n00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.477\nSo if an archer ran out\nof arrows during a battle,\n\n00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:17.424\nthey wouldn't necessarily be able\nto fire another archer's arrows\n\n00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:19.296\nfrom their bow.\n\n00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.881\nThis of course meant that they would\nbe less effective in combat\n\n00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:24.809\nand very vulnerable, too.\n\n00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:26.899\nYing solved this problem\n\n00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:31.014\nby insisting that all bows and arrows\nwere designed identically,\n\n00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:32.769\nso they were interchangeable.\n\n00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:36.795\nAnd he did the same for daggers,\naxes, spears, shields\n\n00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.304\nand every other form of weaponry.\n\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.866\nHis formidably equipped army\nwon batter after battle,\n\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.680\nand within 15 years,\n\n00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:48.862\nhis tiny kingdom had\nsucceeded in conquering\n\n00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:51.711\nall its larger, richer,\nmore powerful neighbors,\n\n00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:54.258\nto found the mighty Chinese Empire.\n\n00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.528\nNow, no one, of course,\n\n00:01:56.552 --> 00:02:00.330\nwould have thought of describing\nYing Zheng as a designer at the time --\n\n00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:01.562\nwhy would they?\n\n00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:05.389\nAnd yet he used design\nunknowingly and instinctively\n\n00:02:05.413 --> 00:02:07.373\nbut with tremendous ingenuity\n\n00:02:07.397 --> 00:02:09.565\nto achieve his ends.\n\n00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:14.129\nAnd so did another equally\nimprobable, accidental designer,\n\n00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:17.908\nwho was also not above using\nviolence to get what he wanted.\n\n00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:23.594\nThis was Edward Teach, better known\nas the British pirate, Blackbeard.\n\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.235\nThis was the golden age of piracy,\n\n00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.932\nwhere pirates like Teach\nwere terrorizing the high seas.\n\n00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:31.925\nColonial trade was flourishing,\n\n00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.210\nand piracy was highly profitable.\n\n00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:39.073\nAnd the smarter pirates like him\nrealized that to maximize their spoils,\n\n00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:43.724\nthey needed to attack\ntheir enemies so brutally\n\n00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:45.541\nthat they would surrender on sight.\n\n00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.716\nSo in other words,\n\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.286\nthey could take the ships\nwithout wasting ammunition,\n\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.351\nor incurring casualties.\n\n00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:55.040\nSo Edward Teach redesigned\nhimself as Blackbeard\n\n00:02:55.064 --> 00:02:57.316\nby playing the part of a merciless brute.\n\n00:02:57.752 --> 00:03:01.777\nHe wore heavy jackets and big hats\nto accentuate his height.\n\n00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:05.296\nHe grew the bushy black beard\nthat obscured his face.\n\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.867\nHe slung braces of pistols\non either shoulder.\n\n00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.789\nHe even attached matches to the brim\nof his hat and set them alight,\n\n00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:16.943\nso they sizzled menacingly\nwhenever his ship was poised to attack.\n\n00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.539\nAnd like many pirates of that era,\n\n00:03:19.563 --> 00:03:22.452\nhe flew a flag that bore\nthe macabre symbols\n\n00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:25.936\nof a human skull\nand a pair of crossed bones,\n\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.651\nbecause those motifs had signified death\nin so many cultures for centuries,\n\n00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:34.537\nthat their meaning\nwas instantly recognizable,\n\n00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:38.101\neven in the lawless, illiterate\nworld of the high seas:\n\n00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:40.601\nsurrender or you'll suffer.\n\n00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.880\nSo of course, all his sensible\nvictims surrendered on sight.\n\n00:03:44.604 --> 00:03:45.934\nPut like that,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.633\nit's easy to see why Edward Teach\nand his fellow pirates\n\n00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:55.132\ncould be seen as pioneers\nof modern communications design,\n\n00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:57.080\nand why their deadly symbol --\n\n00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:58.166\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.341\nthere's more --\n\n00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:02.350\nwhy their deadly symbol\nof the skull and crossbones\n\n00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:04.664\nwas a precursor of today's logos,\n\n00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:08.035\nrather like the big red letters\nstanding behind me,\n\n00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:10.238\nbut of course with a different message.\n\n00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:11.266\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.300\nYet design was also used to nobler ends\n\n00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:18.538\nby an equally brilliant and equally\nimprobable designer,\n\n00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:22.398\nthe 19th-century British nurse,\nFlorence Nightingale.\n\n00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:26.741\nHer mission was to provide\ndecent healthcare for everyone.\n\n00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:31.741\nNightingale was born into a rather\ngrand, very wealthy British family,\n\n00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:35.806\nwho were horrified when she volunteered\nto work in military hospitals\n\n00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.464\nduring the Crimean War.\n\n00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:40.250\nOnce there, she swiftly realized\n\n00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:43.887\nthat more patients were dying\nof infections that they caught there,\n\n00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:45.879\nin the filthy, fetid wards,\n\n00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:47.656\nthan they were of battle wounds.\n\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.966\nSo she campaigned\nfor cleaner, lighter, airier clinics\n\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.746\nto be designed and built.\n\n00:04:54.347 --> 00:04:55.532\nBack in Britain,\n\n00:04:55.556 --> 00:04:57.046\nshe mounted another campaign,\n\n00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.128\nthis time for civilian hospitals,\n\n00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:03.025\nand insisted that the same design\nprinciples were applied to them.\n\n00:05:03.454 --> 00:05:06.206\nThe Nightingale ward, as it is called,\n\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.910\ndominated hospital design\nfor decades to come,\n\n00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.976\nand elements of it are still used today.\n\n00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.047\nBut by then,\n\n00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:18.099\ndesign was seen as a tool\nof the Industrial Age.\n\n00:05:18.123 --> 00:05:20.849\nIt was formalized and professionalized,\n\n00:05:20.873 --> 00:05:23.366\nbut it was restricted to specific roles\n\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.468\nand generally applied in pursuit\nof commercial goals\n\n00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.767\nrather than being used intuitively,\n\n00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:33.017\nas Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard\nand Ying Zheng had done.\n\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.840\nBy the 20th century,\n\n00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:37.877\nthis commercial ethos was so powerful,\n\n00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.425\nthat any designers who deviated from it\n\n00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.056\nrisked being seen as cranks\nor subversives.\n\n00:05:44.496 --> 00:05:48.312\nNow among them is one\nof my great design heroes,\n\n00:05:48.336 --> 00:05:50.864\nthe brilliant L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy.\n\n00:05:50.888 --> 00:05:53.655\nHe was the Hungarian artist and designer\n\n00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:57.935\nwhose experiments with the impact\nof technology on daily life\n\n00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.125\nwere so powerful\n\n00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.449\nthat they still influence\nthe design of the digital images\n\n00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:05.195\nwe see on our phone and computer screens.\n\n00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:10.313\nHe radicalized the Bauhaus Design\nSchool in 1920s Germany,\n\n00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:13.084\nand yet some of his former\ncolleagues shunned him\n\n00:06:13.108 --> 00:06:17.726\nwhen he struggled to open a new\nBauhaus in Chicago years later.\n\n00:06:18.152 --> 00:06:22.366\nMoholy's ideas were as bold\nand incisive as ever,\n\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.117\nbut his approach to design\nwas too experimental,\n\n00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:29.625\nas was his insistence\non seeing it, as he put it,\n\n00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:33.948\nas an attitude, not a profession\nto be in tune with the times.\n\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.593\nAnd sadly, the same applied\n\n00:06:36.617 --> 00:06:41.101\nto another design maverick:\nRichard Buckminster Fuller.\n\n00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:44.815\nHe was yet another\nbrilliant design visionary\n\n00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.256\nand design activist,\n\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.844\nwho was completely committed\nto designing a sustainable society\n\n00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:52.748\nin such a forward-thinking way\n\n00:06:52.772 --> 00:06:56.112\nthat he started talking about\nthe importance of environmentalism\n\n00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:58.889\nin design in the 1920s.\n\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.043\nNow he, despite his efforts,\n\n00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:06.800\nwas routinely mocked as a crank\nby many in the design establishment,\n\n00:07:06.824 --> 00:07:07.992\nand admittedly,\n\n00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:09.809\nsome of his experiments failed,\n\n00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:12.827\nlike the flying car\nthat never got off the ground.\n\n00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:14.899\nAnd yet, the geodesic dome,\n\n00:07:14.923 --> 00:07:18.247\nhis design formula to build\nan emergency shelter\n\n00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.952\nfrom scraps of wood, metal, plastic,\n\n00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:24.222\nbits of tree, old blankets,\nplastic sheeting --\n\n00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:26.993\njust about anything\nthat's available at the time --\n\n00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:30.588\nis one of the greatest feats\nof humanitarian design,\n\n00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:33.275\nand has provided sorely needed refuge\n\n00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:36.522\nto many, many people\nin desperate circumstances\n\n00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:37.777\never since.\n\n00:07:38.404 --> 00:07:42.442\nNow, it was the courage\nand verve of radical designers\n\n00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:44.318\nlike Bucky and Moholy\n\n00:07:44.342 --> 00:07:46.615\nthat drew me to design.\n\n00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.675\nI began my career as a news journalist\nand foreign correspondent.\n\n00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.117\nI wrote about politics, economics\nand corporate affairs,\n\n00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:57.967\nand I could have chosen\nto specialize in any of those fields.\n\n00:07:57.991 --> 00:07:59.735\nBut I picked design,\n\n00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:03.467\nbecause I believe it's one of the most\npowerful tools at our disposal\n\n00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:05.910\nto improve our quality of life.\n\n00:08:07.713 --> 00:08:10.291\nThank you, fellow TED design buffs.\n\n00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:11.979\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:12.003 --> 00:08:16.411\nAnd greatly as I admire the achievements\nof professional designers,\n\n00:08:16.435 --> 00:08:19.030\nwhich have been extraordinary and immense,\n\n00:08:19.054 --> 00:08:20.515\nI also believe\n\n00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:24.032\nthat design benefits hugely\nfrom the originality,\n\n00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:25.374\nthe lateral thinking\n\n00:08:25.398 --> 00:08:29.113\nand the resourcefulness\nof its rebels and renegades.\n\n00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:33.587\nAnd we're living at a remarkable\nmoment in design,\n\n00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:38.415\nbecause this is a time when the two camps\nare coming closer together.\n\n00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:42.730\nBecause even very basic advances\nin digital technology\n\n00:08:42.754 --> 00:08:47.038\nhave enabled them to operate\nincreasingly independently,\n\n00:08:47.062 --> 00:08:49.476\nin or out of a commercial context,\n\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.549\nto pursue ever more ambitious\nand eclectic objectives.\n\n00:08:54.573 --> 00:08:56.219\nSo in theory,\n\n00:08:56.243 --> 00:09:01.530\nbasic platforms like crowdfunding,\ncloud computing, social media\n\n00:09:01.554 --> 00:09:04.998\nare giving greater freedom\nto professional designers\n\n00:09:05.022 --> 00:09:08.507\nand giving more resources\nfor the improvisational ones,\n\n00:09:08.531 --> 00:09:09.688\nand hopefully,\n\n00:09:09.712 --> 00:09:12.217\na more receptive response to their ideas.\n\n00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:16.796\nNow, some of my favorite\nexamples of this are in Africa,\n\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.947\nwhere a new generation of designers\n\n00:09:18.971 --> 00:09:22.516\nare developing incredible\nInternet of Things technologies\n\n00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.144\nto fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream\nof improving healthcare\n\n00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:30.716\nin countries where more people\nnow have access to cell phones\n\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.925\nthan to clean, running water.\n\n00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:35.576\nAnd among them is Arthur Zang.\n\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.470\nHe's a young, Cameroonian design engineer\n\n00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:42.639\nwho has a adapted a tablet\ncomputer into the Cardiopad,\n\n00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:45.086\na mobile heart-monitoring device.\n\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.451\nIt can be used to monitor the hearts\nof patients in remote, rural areas.\n\n00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:52.121\nThe data is then sent\non a cellular network\n\n00:09:52.145 --> 00:09:55.175\nto well-equipped hospitals\nhundreds of miles away\n\n00:09:55.199

I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong step off the Lunar Module onto the surface of the Moon. I had never seen anything like it before, and I've never seen anything like it since.We got to the Moon for one simple reason: John Kennedy committed us to a deadline. And in the absence of that deadline, we would still be dreaming about it. Leonard Bernstein said two things are necessary for great achievement: a plan and not quite enough time.(Laughter)Deadlines and commitments are the great and fading lessons of Apollo. And they are what give the word \"moonshot\" its meaning. And our world is in desperate need of political leaders willing to set bold deadlines for the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of Apollo again.When I think about dreams, I think about the drag queens of LA and Stonewall and millions of other people risking everything to come out when that was really dangerous, and of this picture of the White House lit up in rainbow colors, yes \u2014(Applause) \u2014celebrating America's gay and lesbian citizens' right to marry. It is a picture that in my wildest dreams I could never have imagined when I was 18 and figuring out that I was gay and feeling estranged from my country and my dreams because of it.I think about this picture of my family that I never dreamed I could ever have \u2014(Applause) \u2014and of our children holding this headline I never dreamed could ever be printed about the Supreme Court ruling.We need more of the courage of drag queens and astronauts.(Laughter)(Applause)But I want to talk about the need for us to dream in more than one dimension, because there was something about Apollo that I didn't know when I was 8, and something about organizing that the rainbow colors over. Of the 30 astronauts in the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, only seven marriages survived. Those iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the Moon obscure the alcoholism and depression on Earth.Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, asked during the time of Apollo, \"What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves?\" And what can we gain by the right to marry if we are not able to cross the acrimony and emotional distance that so often separates us from our love? And not just in marriage. I have seen the most hurtful, destructive, tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS and breast cancer and non-profit activism, all in the name of love.Thomas Merton also wrote about wars among saints and that \"there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence to which the idealist most easily succumbs: activism and overwork. The frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace. It destroys our own inner capacity for peace.\" Too often our dreams become these compartmentalized fixations on some future that destroy our ability to be present for our lives right now. Our dreams of a better life for some future humanity or some other humanity in another country alienate us from the beautiful human beings sitting next to us at this very moment.Well, that's just the price of progress, we say. You can go to the Moon or you can have stability in your family life. And we can't conceive of dreaming in both dimensions at the same time. And we don't set the bar much higher than stability when it comes to our emotional life. Which is why our technology for talking to one another has gone vertical, our ability to listen and understand one another has gone nowhere. Our access to information is through the roof, our access to joy, grounded. But this idea, that our present and our future are mutually exclusive, that to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender our profound potential for being, that the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled, but our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love is somehow limited is a false and suffocating choice.Now, I'm not suggesting simply the uninspiring idea of more work-life balance. What good is it for me to spend more time with my kids at home if my mind is always somewhere else while I'm doing it? I'm not even talking about mindfulness. Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool for improving productivity.(Laughter)Right?I'm talking about dreaming as boldly in the dimension of our being as we do about industry and technology. I'm talking about an audacious authenticity that allows us to cry with one another, a heroic humility that allows us to remove our masks and be real. It is our inability to be with one another, our fear of crying with one another, that gives rise to so many of the problems we are frantically trying to solve in the first place, from Congressional gridlock to economic inhumanity.(Applause)I'm talking about what Jonas Salk called an Epoch B, a new epoch in which we become as excited about and curious about and scientific about the development of our humanity as we are about the development of our technology.We should not shrink from this opportunity simply because we don't really understand it. There was a time when we didn't understand space. Or because we're more used to technology and activism. That is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone. We are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement. In 2016, it is the dimension of our being itself that cries out for its fair share of our imagination.Now, we're all here to dream, but maybe if we're honest about it, each of us chasing our own dream. You know, looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream, sometimes looking right through one another's humanity. I can't be bothered with you right now. I have an idea for saving the world. Right?(Laughter)Years ago, once upon a time, I had this beautiful company that created these long journeys for heroic civic engagement. And we had this mantra: \"Human. Kind. Be Both.\" And we encouraged people to experiment outrageously with kindness. Like, \"Go help everybody set up their tents.\" And there were a lot of tents.(Laughter)\"Go buy everybody Popsicles.\" \"Go help people fix their flat tires even though you know the dinner line is going to get longer.\"And people really took us up on this, so much so that if you got a flat tire on the AIDS ride, you had trouble fixing it, because there were so many people there asking you if you needed help.For a few days, for tens of thousands of people, we created these worlds that everybody said were the way they wish the world could always be. What if we experimented with creating that kind of world these next few days? And instead of going up to someone and asking them, \"What do you do?\" ask them, \"So what are your dreams?\" or \"What are your broken dreams?\" You know, \"TED.\" Tend to Each other's Dreams.(Applause)Maybe it's \"I want to stay sober\" or \"I want to build a tree house with my kid.\" You know, instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet, go up to the person who is all alone and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee.I think what we fear most is that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential, that we are born to dream and we might die without ever having the chance.Imagine living in a world where we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another and love one another boldly because we know that to be human is to live with that fear. It's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously, and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things we can and will and must do lies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be.It's time we set foot into that dimension and came out about the fact that we have dreams there, too. If the Moon could dream, I think that would be its dream for us. It's an honor to be with you.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2497, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.934\nWhen I think about

Hope so. I have no idea if you're seeing this, but I'm just going to look ahead and trust that you're there. I've drawn a semicircle in the sand in front of me so I don't walk past it and look like I'm floating in midair.Right now I'm standing in the open air, on a beach under a palm tree, in the exact spot where your stage used to be. I have 12 minutes with you. I set a limit. My wife Navid once said that infinite possibility is a creator's worst enemy. For example, this dress: I'd asked her to design something that a priest might have worn in 23rd-century Cairo. But we only had three days to make it, and the only fabric we had was an old duvet cover that another resident left behind. But she did it, and it's perfect. And she looked at it and said, \"Proof of concept \u2014 creation needs constraint.\" So with these 12 minutes, I'm going to tell you about my greatest discovery.For my whole life, my obsession has been eternal life, as I know it is so many of yours. You may be happy to know that your research will pay off. I am 318 years old. The average human lifespan is now 432 years, and my work has been to extend the human lifespan indefinitely. And I've never questioned that someday, we'll reach a point where we'll be content. But the opposite keeps happening: the longer we live, the longer we want to live, the less we want to die.Who can blame us? The universe is so big. There won't ever not be more to see. Just yesterday, I was reading about how you can take out a boat on Europa and sail from island to island all over the planet, and some of the islands have villages that you can stay and visit and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter. And then there's this other island where there's just one songwriter who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean. And then there are others where there's no one and there never has been, and so you go just for the pleasure of touching your foot to sand that no foot has ever touched before. You could spend 400 years doing just that.Right now the Moon is rising in the Northeast. I can see the cities on it with my naked eye. They're connected like nerve clusters: Mariapolis on the South Pole, and Ramachandran on the Equator. And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.That's where Navid and I met. We were both artists downtown. The day we met, we were passing each other in Azadi Square, and we bumped shoulders. And I turned to apologize and she, without saying hello or introducing herself or anything, said, \"Well, why do you think we didn't just pass through each other?\" And first of all, I thought, \"Who the hell are you?\" But second, the question annoyed me, because the answer is so simple. I said, \"We didn't pass through each other because elementary particles have mass and because the space between elementary particles is filled with the binding energy that also has the properties of mass, and we've known that for 800 years.\" She must have been in one of those moods where she likes to mess with strangers. Or maybe she was just flirting with me, because she looked at me and said, \"I thought you'd say that. Think deeper.\" And then she took off her belt, this belt that I'm wearing now, and she said, \"Our universe is built so that particles have mass. Without that basic constraint, we'd have just passed right through each other at the speed of light and never even known.\"And that's how our romance began. Navid and I never ran out of things to talk about. Never. It was incredible. It was like we were both heroes climbing up into a mountain range together and we kept arriving at new vistas, and these new, perfect constellations of words would come out of us to describe them. And we'd forget them as soon as we made them, and throw them over our shoulder and go on to the next thing, on and up. Or one time, Navid said that our talk was like we were always making bread, and that we were always adding in a little more flour and a little more water, and folding it in and turning it over and never getting around to baking it.If my obsession was eternal life, Navid's obsession was touch. She had a genius for it. All of her work revolved around it. My body was like a canvas for her, and she would draw her fingertip down over my face so slowly that I couldn't feel it moving. And she was obsessed with the exact moment when I would stop being able to tell the difference between her body and mine. Or she would just lie across me and dig her shoulder into mine and say, \"Pilar, why does this feel so good?\" I'd say, \"I don't know!\" And she always had a facetious answer for her facetious question, but the answer I remember today is, \"It feels good because the universe chose its constraints, and we are its art.\"It's always funny what you think the future is going to be like versus what it turns out to be. In your time, scientists thought humans could freeze themselves and wake up in the future. And they did \u2014 but then they died. In your time, scientists thought humans could replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years. And they did, but eventually, they died anyway. In your time, Earth is the only place people live. In my time, Earth is the place people come to die.So when Navid started to show the signs, our friends assumed I would do what everyone does, which is say goodbye and send her to Earth, so that none of us would have to look at her or be around her or think about her and her ... failure to keep living. More than anything, they didn't want to be around her actual physical body. They kept referring to it as \"declining,\" even though she herself was fascinated by it, the changes it was going through, following the rules of its nature day by day, independent of her will. I did send Navid to Earth. But I came with her. I remember a friend of ours, just before we left, said, \"I just think it's arrogant, like the rules don't apply to you, like you think your love is that special.\" But I did.So, even here on Earth, I kept working on how to extend life. It didn't occur to me that there could be any other response. I kept going back to that thing that Navid said to me that day in Azadi Square, that without that basic constraint \u2014 a universe that granted mass to matter \u2014 we would not exist. That's one rule. Another rule is that all mass is subject to entropy. And there is no way to be in this universe without mass. I know. I tried everything. I tried creating a photon box where the Higgs field was altered. I tried recording all subatomic movements in my body and replaying them on closed loop. Nothing worked.But my final innovation was to create a coil dimension with the boundaries of a body in which time moved infinitely slower, but whose projection would appear to move in normal time. That body would then appear in our universe as a hologram \u2014 here but not here. When I realized I'd done it, I ran to her room, so happy to tell her I'd done it, moving through space almost normally to all eyes, even to my own, and went to lie down next to her, and forgot, and fell right through her. I'd found a way to eternal life, at the expense of the one thing Navid loved most, which was to touch and be touched. And she threw me out. I still got to watch, though.Humans live 400 years now, and we still die. And when death comes, the dying still pick at their bedsheets, and their arms break out in blue and violet blooms on the insides, and their breaths get further and further apart, like they're falling asleep.I've always thought that what gives a life meaning is adventure. And death is just a problem we haven't discovered the solution to yet. But maybe a life has meaning only because it ends. Maybe that's the paradox: constraints don't constrain, they allow perfect freedom.(Sighs)There was a thunderstorm here this morning. There is another forecast for tonight, but for now the sky is clear. I can't feel the wind here, but I just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like, and she said it felt warm, like melted butter. An answer worthy of my wife. I have to find my way back to the flesh. Until then, I take up no space but the space you give me.", "id": 2499, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:17.592 --> 00:00:18.862\nDo I look real to

mass,\n\n00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.531\nand we've known that for 800 years.\"\n\n00:04:09.877 --> 00:04:11.833\nShe must have been in one of those moods\n\n00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:13.745\nwhere she likes to mess with strangers.\n\n00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.658\nOr maybe she was just flirting with me,\n\n00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:19.053\nbecause she looked at me and said,\n\"I thought you'd say that.\n\n00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:21.745\nThink deeper.\"\n\n00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.292\nAnd then she took off her belt,\n\n00:04:23.316 --> 00:04:26.819\nthis belt that I'm wearing now,\n\n00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:29.541\nand she said,\n\n00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:36.330\n\"Our universe is built\nso that particles have mass.\n\n00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:40.228\nWithout that basic constraint,\n\n00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:43.735\nwe'd have just passed right through\neach other at the speed of light\n\n00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.229\nand never even known.\"\n\n00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:50.333\nAnd that's how our romance began.\n\n00:04:58.086 --> 00:04:59.546\nNavid and I\n\n00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:03.689\nnever ran out of things to talk about.\n\n00:05:05.268 --> 00:05:06.434\nNever.\n\n00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:08.210\nIt was incredible.\n\n00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:12.768\nIt was like we were both heroes\nclimbing up into a mountain range together\n\n00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:15.247\nand we kept arriving at new vistas,\n\n00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:18.267\nand these new, perfect\nconstellations of words\n\n00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:20.148\nwould come out of us to describe them.\n\n00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:22.296\nAnd we'd forget them\nas soon as we made them,\n\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.741\nand throw them over our shoulder\nand go on to the next thing, on and up.\n\n00:05:25.765 --> 00:05:29.679\nOr one time, Navid said that our talk\nwas like we were always making bread,\n\n00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:33.222\nand that we were always\nadding in a little more flour\n\n00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:34.695\nand a little more water,\n\n00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.672\nand folding it in and turning it over\n\n00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:40.370\nand never getting around to baking it.\n\n00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:47.976\nIf my obsession was eternal life,\nNavid's obsession was touch.\n\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.746\nShe had a genius for it.\n\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.397\nAll of her work revolved around it.\n\n00:05:57.341 --> 00:05:59.547\nMy body was like a canvas for her,\n\n00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:04.192\nand she would draw her fingertip\ndown over my face so slowly\n\n00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:06.199\nthat I couldn't feel it moving.\n\n00:06:06.223 --> 00:06:08.896\nAnd she was obsessed with the exact moment\n\n00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.798\nwhen I would stop being able to tell\nthe difference between her body and mine.\n\n00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:18.674\nOr she would just lie across me\nand dig her shoulder into mine\n\n00:06:18.698 --> 00:06:21.589\nand say, \"Pilar, why does\nthis feel so good?\"\n\n00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:24.550\nI'd say, \"I don't know!\"\n\n00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:31.584\nAnd she always had a facetious answer\nfor her facetious question,\n\n00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:35.555\nbut the answer I remember today is,\n\n00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:38.508\n\"It feels good\n\n00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:41.312\nbecause the universe chose\nits constraints,\n\n00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:42.621\nand we are its art.\"\n\n00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:56.660\nIt's always funny what you think\nthe future is going to be like\n\n00:06:56.684 --> 00:06:58.254\nversus what it turns out to be.\n\n00:07:00.127 --> 00:07:03.231\nIn your time, scientists thought\nhumans could freeze themselves\n\n00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:04.587\nand wake up in the future.\n\n00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:08.429\nAnd they did -- but then they died.\n\n00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:14.801\nIn your time, scientists thought\nhumans could replace organs\n\n00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:17.078\nand extend life for hundreds of years.\n\n00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:19.615\nAnd they did,\n\n00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.641\nbut eventually, they died anyway.\n\n00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:26.729\nIn your time, Earth\nis the only place people live.\n\n00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:33.169\nIn my time, Earth is the place\npeople come to die.\n\n00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:41.017\nSo when Navid started to show the signs,\n\n00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:43.473\nour friends assumed I would do\nwhat everyone does,\n\n00:07:43.497 --> 00:07:45.632\nwhich is say goodbye\nand send her to Earth,\n\n00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:49.690\nso that none of us\nwould have to look at her\n\n00:07:49.714 --> 00:07:53.450\nor be around her\nor think about her and her ...\n\n00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:55.816\nfailure to keep living.\n\n00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:01.953\nMore than anything,\n\n00:08:01.977 --> 00:08:04.754\nthey didn't want to be around\nher actual physical body.\n\n00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:07.782\nThey kept referring to it as \"declining,\"\n\n00:08:08.494 --> 00:08:10.759\neven though she herself\nwas fascinated by it,\n\n00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:12.906\nthe changes it was going through,\n\n00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.803\nfollowing the rules of its nature\nday by day, independent of her will.\n\n00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.009\nI did send Navid to Earth.\n\n00:08:23.906 --> 00:08:25.313\nBut I came with her.\n\n00:08:26.558 --> 00:08:29.467\nI remember a friend of ours,\njust before we left, said,\n\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.697\n\"I just think it's arrogant,\n\n00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:36.911\nlike the rules don't apply to you,\nlike you think your love is that special.\"\n\n00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:40.678\nBut I did.\n\n00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:45.816\nSo, even here on Earth,\n\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.537\nI kept working on how to extend life.\n\n00:08:49.156 --> 00:08:50.307\nIt didn't occur to me\n\n00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:52.374\nthat there could be any other response.\n\n00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.937\nI kept going back to that thing\nthat Navid said to me\n\n00:08:54.961 --> 00:08:56.700\nthat day in Azadi Square,\n\n00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:58.665\nthat without that basic constraint --\n\n00:08:59.444 --> 00:09:01.720\na universe that granted mass to matter --\n\n00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:03.141\nwe would not exist.\n\n00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:06.610\nThat's one rule.\n\n00:09:06.634 --> 00:09:10.522\nAnother rule is that all mass\nis subject to entropy.\n\n00:09:11.887 --> 00:09:14.658\nAnd there is no way to be\nin this universe without mass.\n\n00:09:14.682 --> 00:09:16.364\nI know. I tried everything.\n\n00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:20.527\nI tried creating a photon box\nwhere the Higgs field was altered.\n\n00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:25.133\nI tried recording all\nsubatomic movements in my body\n\n00:09:25.157 --> 00:09:26.944\nand replaying them on closed loop.\n\n00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:28.149\nNothing worked.\n\n00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:38.902\nBut my final innovation\nwas to create a coil dimension\n\n00:09:38.926 --> 00:09:43.257\nwith the boundaries of a body\nin which time moved infinitely slower,\n\n00:09:44.593 --> 00:09:47.676\nbut whose projection would appear\nto move in normal time.\n\n00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:53.017\nThat body would then appear\nin our universe as a hologram --\n\n00:09:55.173 --> 00:09:56.562\nhere but not here.\n\n00:10:01.124 --> 00:10:02.479\nWhen I realized I'd done it,\n\n00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:05.801\nI ran to her room,\n\n00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:08.019\nso happy to tell her I'd done it,\n\n00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:11.654\nmoving through space\nalmost normally to all eyes,\n\n00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:13.662\neven to my own,\n\n00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:17.543\nand went to lie down next to her,\n\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.552\nand forgot, and fell right through her.\n\n00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.446\nI'd found a way to eternal life,\n\n00:10:32.406 --> 00:10:34.716\nat the expense of the one thing\nNavid loved most,\n\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.086\nwhich was to touch and be touched.\n\n00:10:41.897 --> 00:10:43.244\nAnd she threw me out.\n\n00:10:48.378 --> 00:10:50.370\nI still got to watch, though.\n\n00:10:51.706 --> 00:10:53.438\nHumans live 400 years now,\n\n00:10:53.462 --> 00:10:54.840\nand we still die.\n\n00:10:54.864 --> 00:10:57.072\nAnd when death comes,\n\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.555\nthe dying still pick at their bedsheets,\n\n00:11:04.277 --> 00:11:08.088\nand their arms break out\nin blue and violet blooms on the insides,\n\n00:11:08.112 --> 00:11:11.626\nand their breaths get further\nand further apart,\n\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.299\nlike they're falling asleep.\n\n00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:22.992\nI've always thought that\n\n00:11:23.754 --> 00:11:25.848\nwhat gives a life meaning is adventure.\n\n00:11:27.434 --> 00:11:29.827\nAnd death is just a problem\n\n00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:32.319\nwe haven't discovered the solution to yet.\n\n00:11:36.552 --> 00:11:39.255\nBut maybe a life has meaning\nonly because it ends.\n\n00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.502\nMaybe that's the paradox:\n\n00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:45.377\nconstraints don't constrain,\nthey allow perfect freedom.\n\n00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:52.393\n(Sighs)\n\n00:11:57.921 --> 00:11:59.945\nThere was a thunderstorm\nhere this morning.\n\n00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.802\nThere is another forecast for tonight,\n\n00:12:01.826 --> 00:12:03.595\nbut for now the sky is clear.\n\n00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:06.248\nI can't feel the wind here,\n\n00:12:06.272 --> 00:12:09.636\nbut I just asked one of the caretakers\nwho passed by what it felt like,\n\n00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.803\nand she said it felt warm,\nlike melted butter.\n\n00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.133\nAn answer worthy of my wife.\n\n00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:25.184\nI have to find my way back to the flesh.\n\n00:12:28.938 --> 00:12:33.153\nUntil then, I take up no space\nbut the space you give me."}, {"title": "This virtual lab will revolutionize science class", "duration": "686", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_bodekaer_this_virtual_lab_will_revolutionize_science_class", "transcript": "Today, I am going to show you how this tablet and this virtual-reality headset that I'm wearing are going to completely revolutionize science education. And I'm also going to show you how it can make any science teacher more than twice as effective. But before I show you how all of this is possible, let's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education is so vitally important.If you think about it, the world is growing incredibly fast. And with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges, challenges such as dealing with global warming, solving starvation and water shortages and curing diseases, to name just a few.And who, exactly, is going to help us solve all of these great challenges? Well, to a very last degree, it is these young students. This is the next generation of young, bright scientists. And in many ways, we all rely on them for coming up with new, great innovations to help us solve all these challenges ahead of us. And so a couple of years back, my cofounder and I were teaching university students just like these, only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here.(Laughter)And yes, this is really the reality out there in way too many universities around the world: students that are bored, disengaged and sometimes not even sure why they're learning about a topic in the first place.So we started looking around for new, innovative teaching methods, but what we found was quite disappointing. We saw that books were being turned into e-books, blackboards were being turned into YouTube videos and lecture hall monologues were being turned into MOOCs \u2014 massive online open courses. And if you think about it, all we're really doing here is taking the same content and the same format, and bringing it out to more students \u2014 which is great, don't get me wrong, that is really great \u2014 but the teaching method is still more or less the same, no real innovation there.So we started looking elsewhere. What we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again to be far more effective when used in combination with real, in-flight training to train the pilots. And so we thought to ourselves: Why not just apply that to science? Why not build a virtual laboratory simulator?Well, we did it. We basically set out to create a fully simulated, one-to-one, virtual reality laboratory simulator, where the students could perform experiments with mathematical equations that would simulate what would happen in a real-world lab. But not just simple simulations \u2014 we would also create advanced simulations with top universities like MIT, to bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students. And suddenly, the universities could save millions of dollars by letting the students perform virtual experiments before they go into the real laboratory. And not only that; now, they could also understand \u2014 even on a molecular level inside the machine \u2014 what is happening to the machines. And then they could suddenly perform dangerous experiments in the labs as well. For instance also here, learning about salmonella bacteria, which is an important topic that many schools cannot teach for good safety reasons. And we, of course, quiz the students and then give the teachers a full dashboard, so they fully understand where the students are at.But we didn't stop there, because we had seen just how important meaning is for the students' engagement in the class. So we brought in game designers to create fun and engaging stories. For instance, here in this case, where the students have to solve a mysterious CSI murder case using their core science skills.And the feedback we got when we launched all of this was quite overwhelmingly positive. Here we have 300 students, all passionately solving CSI murder cases while learning core science skills. And what I love the most about this is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards, all surprised and a little confused, and say, \"I just spent two hours in this virtual lab, and ... and I didn't check Facebook.\"(Laughter)That's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students.And so, to investigate whether this really worked, a learning psychologist did a study with 160 students \u2014 that was from Stanford University and Technical University of Denmark. And what they did is split the students into two groups. One group would only use the virtual laboratory simulations, the other group would only use traditional teaching methods, and they had the same amount of time. Then, interestingly, they gave the students a test before and after the experiment, so they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students. And what they found was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods.But even more interestingly, the second part of this study investigated what the teacher's impact was on the learning. And what they found was that when you combined the virtual laboratories with teacher-led coaching and mentoring, then we saw a total 101 percent increase in the learning effectiveness, which effectively doubles the science teacher's impact with the same amount of time spent. So a couple of months back, we started asking ourselves \u2014 we have a wonderful team now of learning psychologists and teachers and scientists and game developers \u2014 and we started asking ourselves: How can we keep ourselves to our promise of constantly reimagining education?And today, I am really excited to be presenting what we came up with and have been working incredibly hard to create. I will explain briefly what this is. Basically, I take my mobile phone \u2014 most students already have these, smartphones \u2014 and I plug it into this virtual-reality headset, a low-cost headset. And now what I can effectively do is, I can literally step into this virtual world. We'll have some of you in the audience also get to try this, because it is really something that you have to try to fully feel how immersive it really is. It literally feels like I just stepped inside this virtual lab. Do you see me up on the screen?Audience: Yes.Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.So basically, I have just turned my mobile phone into a fully simulated, million-dollar Ivy League laboratory with all this amazing equipment that I can interact with. I can, for instance, pick up the pipette and do experiments with it. I have my E-Ggel, my PCR and \u2014 oh, look there, I have my next-generation sequencing machine, and there I even have my electron microscope. I mean, who's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket? And here I have my machine, I can do different experiments on the machine. And over here I have the door, I can go into other experiments, I can perform in the laboratories. And here, I have my learning tablet. This is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read about relevant theory. As you can see, I can interact with it. I can watch videos and see content that is relevant to the experiment that I'm performing right now. Then over here, I have Marie. She is my teacher \u2014 my lab assistant \u2014 and what she does is guides me through this whole laboratory. And very soon, the teachers will be able to literally teleport themselves into this virtual world that I'm in right now and help me, guide me, through this whole experiment.And now before I finalize this, I want to show you an even cooler thing, I think \u2014 something you cannot even do in real laboratories. This is a PCR machine. I'm now going to start this experiment. And what I just did is literally shrunk myself a million times into the size of a molecule \u2014 and it really feels like it, you have to try this. So now it feels like I'm standing inside the machine and I'm seeing all the DNA, and I see the molecules. I see the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth. And I can see how in this case, DNA is being replicated millions of times, just like it's happening inside your body right now. And I can really feel and understand how all of this works.Now, I hope that gives you a little bit of a sense of the possibilities in these new teaching methods. And I want to also emphasize that everything you just saw also works on iPads and laptops without the headsets. I say that for a very important reason. In order for us to really empower and inspire the next generation of scientists, we really need teachers to drive the adoption of new technologies in the classroom. And so in many ways, I believe that the next big, quantum leap in science education lies no longer with the technology, but rather with the teachers' decision to push forward and adopt these technologies inside the classrooms. And so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential.And so, lastly, I'd like to leave you with a little story that really inspires me. And that is the story of Jack Andraka. Some of you might already know him. Jack invented a new, groundbreaking low-cost test for pancreatic cancer at the age 15. And when Jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough, he also explains that one thing almost prevented him from making this breakthrough. And that was that he did not have access to real laboratories, because he was too inexperienced to be allowed in.Now, imagine if we could bring Ivy League, million-dollar virtual laboratories out to all these students just like Jack, all over the world, and give them the latest, greatest, most fancy machines you can imagine that would quite literally make any scientist in here jump up and down out of pure excitement. And then imagine how that would empower and inspire a whole new generation of young and bright scientists, ready to innovate and change the world.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2500,

you\n\n00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:30.661\nhow it can make any science teacher\nmore than twice as effective.\n\n00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:34.546\nBut before I show you\nhow all of this is possible,\n\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.109\nlet's talk briefly about why improving\nthe quality of science education\n\n00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.573\nis so vitally important.\n\n00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:44.632\nIf you think about it,\n\n00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:46.931\nthe world is growing incredibly fast.\n\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.165\nAnd with that growth comes\na whole list of growing challenges,\n\n00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:54.202\nchallenges such as dealing\nwith global warming,\n\n00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:56.589\nsolving starvation and water shortages\n\n00:00:56.613 --> 00:00:58.065\nand curing diseases,\n\n00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.614\nto name just a few.\n\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.840\nAnd who, exactly, is going to help us\nsolve all of these great challenges?\n\n00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.128\nWell, to a very last degree,\nit is these young students.\n\n00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:13.994\nThis is the next generation\nof young, bright scientists.\n\n00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:17.038\nAnd in many ways, we all rely on them\n\n00:01:17.062 --> 00:01:19.864\nfor coming up with new, great innovations\n\n00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:23.599\nto help us solve all\nthese challenges ahead of us.\n\n00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.617\nAnd so a couple of years back,\n\n00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.000\nmy cofounder and I were teaching\nuniversity students just like these,\n\n00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:36.138\nonly the students we were teaching\nlooked a little bit more like this here.\n\n00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.226\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.088\nAnd yes, this is really\nthe reality out there\n\n00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:43.637\nin way too many universities\naround the world:\n\n00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:46.314\nstudents that are bored, disengaged\n\n00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:49.943\nand sometimes not even sure\nwhy they're learning about a topic\n\n00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:51.166\nin the first place.\n\n00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:56.055\nSo we started looking around for new,\ninnovative teaching methods,\n\n00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.902\nbut what we found was quite disappointing.\n\n00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:02.591\nWe saw that books were being\nturned into e-books,\n\n00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:06.469\nblackboards were being turned\ninto YouTube videos\n\n00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.637\nand lecture hall monologues\nwere being turned into MOOCs --\n\n00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:11.962\nmassive online open courses.\n\n00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:13.899\nAnd if you think about it,\n\n00:02:13.923 --> 00:02:17.506\nall we're really doing here\nis taking the same content\n\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.078\nand the same format,\n\n00:02:19.102 --> 00:02:22.028\nand bringing it out to more students --\n\n00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:25.361\nwhich is great, don't get me\nwrong, that is really great --\n\n00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:29.012\nbut the teaching method\nis still more or less the same,\n\n00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:31.332\nno real innovation there.\n\n00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:33.840\nSo we started looking elsewhere.\n\n00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:38.491\nWhat we found was that flight simulators\nhad been proven over and over again\n\n00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:39.982\nto be far more effective\n\n00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:45.272\nwhen used in combination with real,\nin-flight training to train the pilots.\n\n00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.921\nAnd so we thought to ourselves:\n\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.827\nWhy not just apply that to science?\n\n00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:54.402\nWhy not build a virtual\nlaboratory simulator?\n\n00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:56.769\nWell, we did it.\n\n00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.611\nWe basically set out to create\n\n00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:04.250\na fully simulated, one-to-one,\nvirtual reality laboratory simulator,\n\n00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:06.471\nwhere the students\ncould perform experiments\n\n00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:08.405\nwith mathematical equations\n\n00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.648\nthat would simulate what would\nhappen in a real-world lab.\n\n00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:13.351\nBut not just simple simulations --\n\n00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.441\nwe would also create advanced simulations\n\n00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:17.389\nwith top universities like MIT,\n\n00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:21.782\nto bring out cutting-edge cancer\nresearch to these students.\n\n00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:25.361\nAnd suddenly, the universities\ncould save millions of dollars\n\n00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.315\nby letting the students\nperform virtual experiments\n\n00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.451\nbefore they go into the real laboratory.\n\n00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.793\nAnd not only that; now,\nthey could also understand --\n\n00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:37.250\neven on a molecular level\ninside the machine --\n\n00:03:37.274 --> 00:03:39.950\nwhat is happening to the machines.\n\n00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:41.873\nAnd then they could suddenly perform\n\n00:03:41.897 --> 00:03:44.525\ndangerous experiments in the labs as well.\n\n00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.035\nFor instance also here,\n\n00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.671\nlearning about salmonella bacteria,\nwhich is an important topic\n\n00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:53.666\nthat many schools cannot teach\nfor good safety reasons.\n\n00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:56.010\nAnd we, of course, quiz the students\n\n00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:58.439\nand then give the teachers\na full dashboard,\n\n00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:01.389\nso they fully understand\nwhere the students are at.\n\n00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:03.300\nBut we didn't stop there,\n\n00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:05.649\nbecause we had seen just\nhow important meaning is\n\n00:04:05.673 --> 00:04:07.959\nfor the students' engagement in the class.\n\n00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:09.705\nSo we brought in game designers\n\n00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.610\nto create fun and engaging stories.\n\n00:04:12.634 --> 00:04:14.468\nFor instance, here in this case,\n\n00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:18.615\nwhere the students have to solve\na mysterious CSI murder case\n\n00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.333\nusing their core science skills.\n\n00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.263\nAnd the feedback we got\nwhen we launched all of this\n\n00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:28.239\nwas quite overwhelmingly positive.\n\n00:04:28.263 --> 00:04:30.066\nHere we have 300 students,\n\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.805\nall passionately solving CSI murder cases\n\n00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:34.694\nwhile learning core science skills.\n\n00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:36.963\nAnd what I love the most about this\n\n00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:40.631\nis really when the students\ncome up to me sometimes afterwards,\n\n00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.770\nall surprised and a little confused,\n\n00:04:42.794 --> 00:04:47.497\nand say, \"I just spent two hours\nin this virtual lab,\n\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.569\nand ... and I didn't check Facebook.\"\n\n00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:51.922\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.946 --> 00:04:56.597\nThat's how engaging and immersive\nthis really is for the students.\n\n00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.441\nAnd so, to investigate\nwhether this really worked,\n\n00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:03.868\na learning psychologist\ndid a study with 160 students --\n\n00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:08.138\nthat was from Stanford University\nand Technical University of Denmark.\n\n00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:11.694\nAnd what they did is split\nthe students into two groups.\n\n00:05:11.718 --> 00:05:15.969\nOne group would only use\nthe virtual laboratory simulations,\n\n00:05:15.993 --> 00:05:19.693\nthe other group would only use\ntraditional teaching methods,\n\n00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:21.632\nand they had the same amount of time.\n\n00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.911\nThen, interestingly,\n\n00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:27.602\nthey gave the students a test\nbefore and after the experiment,\n\n00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:31.979\nso they could clearly measure\nthe learning impact of the students.\n\n00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:33.171\nAnd what they found\n\n00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:38.996\nwas a surprisingly high 76 percent\nincrease in the learning effectiveness\n\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.864\nwhen using virtual laboratories\nover traditional teaching methods.\n\n00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:45.792\nBut even more interestingly,\n\n00:05:45.816 --> 00:05:49.030\nthe second part of this study investigated\n\n00:05:49.054 --> 00:05:51.958\nwhat the teacher's impact\nwas on the learning.\n\n00:05:51.982 --> 00:05:53.133\nAnd what they found\n\n00:05:53.157 --> 00:05:55.819\nwas that when you combined\nthe virtual laboratories\n\n00:05:55.843 --> 00:05:58.447\nwith teacher-led coaching and mentoring,\n\n00:05:58.471 --> 00:06:04.287\nthen we saw a total 101 percent\nincrease in the learning effectiveness,\n\n00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:08.743\nwhich effectively doubles\nthe science teacher's impact\n\n00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:11.125\nwith the same amount of time spent.\n\n00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:16.452\nSo a couple of months back,\n\n00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.989\nwe started asking ourselves --\n\n00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:20.560\nwe have a wonderful team now\nof learning psychologists\n\n00:06:20.584 --> 00:06:22.940\nand teachers and scientists\nand game developers --\n\n00:06:22.964 --> 00:06:24.505\nand we started asking ourselves:\n\n00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.124\nHow can we keep ourselves to our promise\n\n00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:30.112\nof constantly reimagining education?\n\n00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:35.237\nAnd today, I am really excited\nto be presenting what we came up with\n\n00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:38.165\nand have been working\nincredibly hard to create.\n\n00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:42.819\nI will explain briefly what this is.\n\n00:06:42.843 --> 00:06:45.579\nBasically, I take my mobile phone --\n\n00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:48.309\nmost students already\nhave these, smartphones --\n\n00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:52.857\nand I plug it into this virtual-reality\nheadset, a low-cost headset.\n\n00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:54.850\nAnd now what I can effectively do is,\n\n00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:58.024\nI can literally step\ninto this virtual world.\n\n00:06:58.048 --> 00:07:01.132\nWe'll have some of you\nin the audience also get to try this,\n\n00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:04.312\nbecause it is really something\nthat you have to try\n\n00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:06.631\nto fully feel how immersive it really is.\n\n00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:10.432\nIt literally feels like I just stepped\ninside this virtual lab.\n\n00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:11.959\nDo you see me up on the screen?\n\n00:07:11.983 --> 00:07:13.134\nAudience: Yes.\n\n00:07:13.158 --> 00:07:14.761\nMichael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.\n\n00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:17.683\nSo basically, I have just\nturned my mobile phone\n\n00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:21.371\ninto a fully simulated, million-dollar\nIvy League laboratory\n\n00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:24.220\nwith all this amazing equipment\nthat I can interact with.\n\n00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:27.617\nI can, for instance, pick up the pipette\nand do experiments with it.\n\n00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:30.061\nI have my E-Ggel, my PCR\nand -- oh, look there,\n\n00:07:30.085 --> 00:07:32.606\nI have my next-generation\nsequencing machine,\n\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.128\nand there I even have\nmy electron microscope.\n\n00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:39.582\nI mean, who's carrying around\nan electron microscope in their pocket?\n\n00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:41.478\nAnd here I have my machine,\n\n00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.672\nI can do different experiments\non the machine.\n\n00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:45.150\nAnd over here I have the door,\n\n00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:47.542\nI can go into other experiments,\n\n00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:49.499\nI can perform in the laboratories.\n\n00:07:49.523 --> 00:07:51.729\nAnd here, I have my learning tablet.\n\n00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:53.207\nThis is an intelligent tablet\n\n00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.079\nthat allows me to read\nabout relevant theory.\n\n00:07:56.103 --> 00:07:58.405\nAs you can see, I can interact with it.\n\n00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:02.323\nI can watch videos and see\ncontent that is relevant\n\n00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:05.212\nto the experiment\nthat I'm performing right now.\n\n00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:07.435\nThen over here, I have Marie.\n\n00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:10.978\nShe is my teacher --\nmy lab assistant --\n\n00:08:11.002 --> 00:08:14.179\nand what she does is guides me\nthrough this whole laboratory.\n\n00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:15.362\nAnd very soon,\n\n00:08:15.386 --> 00:08:18.354\nthe teachers will be able\nto literally teleport themselves\n\n00:08:18.378 --> 00:08:20.937\ninto this virtual world\nthat I'm in right now\n\n00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:24.191\nand help me, guide me,\nthrough this whole experiment.\n\n00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:26.525\nAnd now before I finalize this,\n\n00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:29.517\nI want to show you\nan even cooler thing, I think --\n\n00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:32.577\nsomething you cannot\neven do in real laboratories.\n\n00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:33.839\nThis is a PCR machine.\n\n00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:36.343\nI'm now going to start this experiment.\n\n00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:40.600\nAnd what I just did is literally\nshrunk myself a million times\n\n00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.183\ninto the size of a molecule --\n\n00:08:42.207 --> 00:08:44.556\nand it really feels like it,\nyou have to try this.\n\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.183\nSo now it feels like\nI'm standing inside the machine\n\n00:08:47.207 --> 00:08:49.800\nand I'm seeing all the DNA,\nand I see the molecules.\n\n00:08:49.824 --> 00:08:53.427\nI see the polymerase\nand the enzymes and so forth.\n\n00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:55.054\nAnd I can see how in this case,\n\n00:08:55.078 --> 00:08:58.155\nDNA is being replicated millions of times,\n\n00:08:58.179 --> 00:09:01.012\njust like it's happening\ninside your body right now.\n\n00:09:01.036 --> 00:09:05.163\nAnd I can really feel and understand\nhow all of this works.\n\n00:09:06.177 --> 00:09:09.471\nNow, I hope that gives you\na little bit of a sense\n\n00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:13.621\nof the possibilities\nin these new teaching methods.\n\n00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:17.530\nAnd I want to also emphasize\n\n00:09:17.554 --> 00:09:21.245\nthat everything you just saw\nalso works on iPads and laptops\n\n00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.440\nwithout the headsets.\n\n00:09:22.464 --> 00:09:24.828\nI say that for a very important reason.\n\n00:09:25.352 --> 00:09:28.837\nIn order for us to really\nempower and inspire\n\n00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:31.029\nthe next generation of scientists,\n\n00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:34.577\nwe really need teachers\nto drive the adoption\n\n00:09:34.601 --> 00:09:37.176\nof new technologies in the

00:09:47.090\nlies no longer with the technology,\n\n00:09:47.114 --> 00:09:48.995\nbut rather with the teachers' decision\n\n00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:52.224\nto push forward and adopt\nthese

"https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_kahn_gene_editing_can_now_change_an_entire_species_forever", "transcript": "So this is a talk about gene drives, but I'm going to start by telling you a brief story. 20 years ago, a biologist named Anthony James got obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos that didn't transmit malaria.It was a great idea, and pretty much a complete failure. For one thing, it turned out to be really hard to make a malaria-resistant mosquito. James managed it, finally, just a few years ago, by adding some genes that make it impossible for the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito.But that just created another problem. Now that you've got a malaria-resistant mosquito, how do you get it to replace all the malaria-carrying mosquitos? There are a couple options, but plan A was basically to breed up a bunch of the new genetically-engineered mosquitos release them into the wild and hope that they pass on their genes. The problem was that you'd have to release literally 10 times the number of native mosquitos to work. So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos, you release an extra 100,000. As you might guess, this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers.(Laughter)Then, last January, Anthony James got an email from a biologist named Ethan Bier. Bier said that he and his grad student Valentino Gantz had stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee that a particular genetic trait would be inherited, but that it would spread incredibly quickly. If they were right, it would basically solve the problem that he and James had been working on for 20 years.As a test, they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti-malaria gene and also this new tool, a gene drive, which I'll explain in a minute. Finally, they set it up so that any mosquitos that had inherited the anti-malaria gene wouldn't have the usual white eyes, but would instead have red eyes. That was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which.So they took their two anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos and put them in a box with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones, and let them breed. In two generations, those had produced 3,800 grandchildren. That is not the surprising part. This is the surprising part: given that you started with just two red-eyed mosquitos and 30 white-eyed ones, you expect mostly white-eyed descendants. Instead, when James opened the box, all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment, he became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone. That's because getting only red-eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology, Mendelian genetics. I'll keep this quick, but Mendelian genetics says when a male and a female mate, their baby inherits half of its DNA from each parent. So if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is aB, where B is the anti-malarial gene, the babies should come out in four permutations: aa, aB, aa, Ba. Instead, with the new gene drive, they all came out aB. Biologically, that shouldn't even be possible.So what happened? The first thing that happened was the arrival of a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR in 2012. Many of you have probably heard about CRISPR, so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely, easily and quickly. It does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria. Basically, there's a protein that acts like a scissors and cuts the DNA, and there's an RNA molecule that directs the scissors to any point on the genome you want. The result is basically a word processor for genes. You can take an entire gene out, put one in, or even edit just a single letter within a gene. And you can do it in nearly any species.OK, remember how I said that gene drives originally had two problems? The first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito to be malaria-resistant. That's basically gone now, thanks to CRISPR. But the other problem was logistical. How do you get your trait to spread? This is where it gets clever.A couple years ago, a biologist at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt wondered what would happen if you made it so that CRISPR inserted not only your new gene but also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting. In other words, what if CRISPR also copied and pasted itself. You'd end up with a perpetual motion machine for gene editing. And that's exactly what happened. This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created not only guarantees that a trait will get passed on, but if it's used in the germline cells, it will automatically copy and paste your new gene into both chromosomes of every single individual. It's like a global search and replace, or in science terms, it makes a heterozygous trait homozygous.So, what does this mean? For one thing, it means we have a very powerful, but also somewhat alarming new tool. Up until now, the fact that gene drives didn't work very well was actually kind of a relief. Normally when we mess around with an organism's genes, we make that thing less evolutionarily fit. So biologists can make all the mutant fruit flies they want without worrying about it. If some escape, natural selection just takes care of them.What's remarkable and powerful and frightening about gene drives is that that will no longer be true. Assuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap, like a mosquito that can't fly, the CRISPR-based gene drive will spread the change relentlessly until it is in every single individual in the population. Now, it isn't easy to make a gene drive that works that well, but James and Esvelt think that we can.The good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things. If you put an anti-malarial gene drive in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes, the species that transmits malaria, researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year. So in a year, you could virtually eliminate malaria. In practice, we're still a few years out from being able to do that, but still, a 1,000 children a day die of malaria. In a year, that number could be almost zero. The same goes for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever.And it gets better. Say you want to get rid of an invasive species, like get Asian carp out of the Great Lakes. All you have to do is release a gene drive that makes the fish produce only male offspring. In a few generations, there'll be no females left, no more carp. In theory, this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink.OK, that's the good news, this is the bad news. Gene drives are so effective that even an accidental release could change an entire species, and often very quickly. Anthony James took good precautions. He bred his mosquitos in a bio-containment lab and he also used a species that's not native to the US so that even if some did escape, they'd just die off, there'd be nothing for them to mate with. But it's also true that if a dozen Asian carp with the all-male gene drive accidentally got carried from the Great Lakes back to Asia, they could potentially wipe out the native Asian carp population. And that's not so unlikely, given how connected our world is. In fact, it's why we have an invasive species problem. And that's fish. Things like mosquitos and fruit flies, there's literally no way to contain them. They cross borders and oceans all the time.OK, the other piece of bad news is that a gene drive might not stay confined to what we call the target species. That's because of gene flow, which is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species sometimes interbreed. If that happens, it's possible a gene drive could cross over, like Asian carp could infect some other kind of carp. That's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait, like eye color. In fact, there's a decent chance that we'll see a wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future. But it could be a disaster if your drive is deigned to eliminate the species entirely.The last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this, to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive, is something that basically any lab in the world can do. An undergraduate can do it. A talented high schooler with some equipment can do it.Now, I'm guessing that this sounds terrifying.(Laughter)Interestingly though, nearly every scientist I talk to seemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous. Partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them.(Laughter)So far, that's been true. But gene drives also have some actual limitations. So for one thing, they work only in sexually reproducing species. So thank goodness, they can't be used to engineer viruses or bacteria. Also, the trait spreads only with each successive generation. So changing or eliminating a population is practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle, like insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish. In elephants or people, it would take centuries for a trait to spread widely enough to matter.Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait. Say you wanted to make a fruit fly that feeds on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit, with the aim of sabotaging American agriculture. First, you'd have to figure out which genes control what the fly wants to eat, which is already a very long and complicated project. Then you'd have to alter those genes to change the fly's behavior to whatever you'd want it to be, which is an even longer and more complicated project. And it might not even work, because the genes that control behavior are complex. So if you're a terrorist and have to choose between starting a grueling basic research program that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out, or just blowing stuff up? You'll probably choose the later.This is especially true because at least in theory, it should be pretty easy to build what's called a reversal drive. That's one that basically overwrites the change made by the first gene drive. So if you don't like the effects of a change, you can just release a second drive that will cancel it out, at least in theory.OK, so where does this leave us? We now have the ability to change entire species at will. Should we? Are we gods now? I'm not sure I'd say that. But I would say this: first, some very smart people are even now debating how to regulate gene drives. At the same time, some other very smart people are working hard to create safeguards, like gene drives that self-regulate or peter out after a few generations. That's great. But this technology still requires a conversation. And given the nature of gene drives, that conversation has to be global. What if Kenya wants to use a drive but Tanzania doesn't? Who decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly?I don't have the answer to that question. All we can do going forward, I think, is talk honestly about the risks and benefits and take responsibility for our choices. By that I mean, not just the choice to use a gene drive, but also the choice not to use one. Humans have a tendency to assume that the safest option is to preserve the status quo. But that's not always the case. Gene drives have risks, and those need to be discussed, but malaria exists now and kills 1,000 people a day. To combat it, we spray pesticides that do grave damage to other species, including amphibians and birds.So when you hear about gene drives in the coming months, and trust me, you will be hearing about them, remember that. It can be frightening to act, but sometimes, not acting is worse.(Applause)", "id": 2494, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.264\nSo

absolute\ncornerstone of biology,\n\n00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:58.245\nMendelian genetics.\n\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.039\nI'll keep this quick,\n\n00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:02.827\nbut Mendelian

aa\nand our new mosquito is aB,\n\n00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:10.938\nwhere B is the anti-malarial gene,\n\n00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:13.349\nthe babies should come out\nin four permutations:\n\n00:03:13.373

00:03:24.410\nBiologically, that shouldn't\neven be possible.\n\n00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:25.738\nSo what happened?\n\n00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.111\nThe first thing that happened\n\n00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:31.405\nwas the arrival of a gene-editing tool\nknown as CRISPR in 2012.\n\n00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.769\nMany of you have probably\nheard about CRISPR,\n\n00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:38.094\nso

single\nletter within a gene.\n\n00:04:01.604 --> 00:04:03.557\nAnd you can do it in nearly any species.\n\n00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:09.000\nOK, remember how I said that gene drives\noriginally had two problems?\n\n00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:12.913\nThe first was that it was hard\nto engineer a mosquito\n\n00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:14.324\nto be malaria-resistant.\n\n00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:16.475\nThat's basically gone now,\nthanks to CRISPR.\n\n00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:18.837\nBut the other problem was logistical.\n\n00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:21.067\nHow do you get your trait to spread?\n\n00:04:22.154 --> 00:04:23.630\nThis is where it gets clever.\n\n00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:28.503\nA couple years ago, a biologist\nat Harvard named Kevin Esvelt\n\n00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:29.877\nwondered what would happen\n\n00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:33.528\nif you made it so that\nCRISPR inserted not only your new gene\n\n00:04:33.552 --> 00:04:36.393\nbut also the machinery\nthat does the cutting and pasting.\n\n00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:41.031\nIn other words, what if CRISPR\nalso copied and pasted itself.\n\n00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:45.234\nYou'd end up with a perpetual\nmotion machine for gene editing.\n\n00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:48.150\nAnd that's exactly what happened.\n\n00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:51.873\nThis CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created\n\n00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:55.540\nnot only guarantees\nthat a trait will get passed on,\n\n00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:58.002\nbut if it's used in the germline cells,\n\n00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:00.602\nit will automatically copy and paste\nyour new gene\n\n00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:03.272\ninto both chromosomes\nof every single individual.\n\n00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:06.098\nIt's like a global search and replace,\n\n00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:09.343\nor in science terms, it makes\na heterozygous trait homozygous.\n\n00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:13.614\nSo, what does this mean?\n\n00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:16.362\nFor one thing, it means we have\na very powerful,\n\n00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:19.043\nbut also somewhat alarming new tool.\n\n00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:23.423\nUp until now, the fact that gene drives\ndidn't work very well\n\n00:05:23.447 --> 00:05:24.930\nwas actually kind of a relief.\n\n00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:28.065\nNormally when we mess around\nwith an organism's genes,\n\n00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.438\nwe make that thing\nless evolutionarily fit.\n\n00:05:30.462 --> 00:05:33.295\nSo biologists can make\nall the mutant fruit flies they want\n\n00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.572\nwithout worrying about it.\n\n00:05:34.596 --> 00:05:37.603\nIf some escape, natural selection\njust takes care of them.\n\n00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:41.931\nWhat's remarkable and powerful\nand frightening about gene drives\n\n00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:43.715\nis that that will no longer be true.\n\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.614\nAssuming that your trait does not have\na big evolutionary handicap,\n\n00:05:48.638 --> 00:05:50.717\nlike a mosquito that can't fly,\n\n00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:54.194\nthe CRISPR-based gene drive\nwill spread the change relentlessly\n\n00:05:54.218 --> 00:05:57.224\nuntil it is in every single individual\nin the population.\n\n00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.948\nNow, it isn't easy to make\na gene drive that works that well,\n\n00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:04.146\nbut James and Esvelt think that we can.\n\n00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:09.121\nThe good news is that this opens\nthe door to some remarkable things.\n\n00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:11.049\nIf you put an anti-malarial gene drive\n\n00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:13.273\nin just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,\n\n00:06:13.297 --> 00:06:15.049\nthe species that transmits malaria,\n\n00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:19.565\nresearchers estimate that it would spread\nto the entire population in a year.\n\n00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:23.005\nSo in a year, you could virtually\neliminate malaria.\n\n00:06:23.413 --> 00:06:27.285\nIn practice, we're still a few years out\nfrom being able to do that,\n\n00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.027\nbut still, a 1,000 children\na day die of malaria.\n\n00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:32.241\nIn a year, that number\ncould be almost zero.\n\n00:06:32.924 --> 00:06:35.820\nThe same goes for dengue fever,\nchikungunya, yellow fever.\n\n00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.574\nAnd it gets better.\n\n00:06:39.173 --> 00:06:41.649\nSay you want to get rid\nof an invasive species,\n\n00:06:41.673 --> 00:06:43.796\nlike get Asian carp\nout of the Great Lakes.\n\n00:06:44.392 --> 00:06:46.416\nAll you have to do is release a gene drive\n\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.757\nthat makes the fish produce\nonly male offspring.\n\n00:06:49.344 --> 00:06:53.542\nIn a few generations,\nthere'll be no females left, no more carp.\n\n00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:56.645\nIn theory, this means we could restore\nhundreds of native species\n\n00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.336\nthat have been pushed to the brink.\n\n00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:02.655\nOK, that's the good news,\n\n00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:03.971\nthis is the bad news.\n\n00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:07.056\nGene drives are so effective\n\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.905\nthat even an accidental release\ncould change an entire species,\n\n00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:12.119\nand often very quickly.\n\n00:07:13.136 --> 00:07:15.262\nAnthony James took good precautions.\n\n00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:17.452\nHe bred his mosquitos\nin a bio-containment lab\n\n00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:20.064\nand he also used a species\nthat's not native to the US\n\n00:07:20.088 --> 00:07:21.643\nso that even if some did escape,\n\n00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:24.682\nthey'd just die off, there'd be nothing\nfor them to mate with.\n\n00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:28.729\nBut it's also true that if a dozen\nAsian carp with the all-male gene drive\n\n00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:32.682\naccidentally got carried\nfrom the Great Lakes back to Asia,\n\n00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:36.135\nthey could potentially wipe out\nthe native Asian carp population.\n\n00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:40.800\nAnd that's not so unlikely,\ngiven how connected our world is.\n\n00:07:40.824 --> 00:07:43.395\nIn fact, it's why we have\nan invasive species problem.\n\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.038\nAnd that's fish.\n\n00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:47.974\nThings like mosquitos and fruit flies,\n\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:49.958\nthere's literally no way to contain them.\n\n00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:52.093\nThey cross borders\nand oceans all the time.\n\n00:07:53.712 --> 00:07:55.894\nOK, the other piece of bad news\n\n00:07:55.918 --> 00:07:58.236\nis that a gene drive\nmight not stay confined\n\n00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.073\nto what we call the target species.\n\n00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.013\nThat's because of gene flow,\n\n00:08:02.037 --> 00:08:04.634\nwhich is a fancy way of saying\nthat neighboring species\n\n00:08:04.658 --> 00:08:05.906\nsometimes interbreed.\n\n00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.081\nIf that happens, it's possible\na gene drive could cross over,\n\n00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:11.632\nlike Asian carp could infect\nsome other kind of carp.\n\n00:08:11.656 --> 00:08:15.371\nThat's not so bad if your drive\njust promotes a trait, like eye color.\n\n00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:17.642\nIn fact, there's a decent\nchance that we'll see\n\n00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:20.237\na wave of very weird fruit flies\nin the near future.\n\n00:08:21.348 --> 00:08:22.611\nBut it could be a disaster\n\n00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:25.539\nif your drive is deigned\nto eliminate the species entirely.\n\n00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:29.837\nThe last worrisome thing\nis that the technology to do this,\n\n00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:33.552\nto genetically engineer an organism\nand include a gene drive,\n\n00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:36.910\nis something that basically any lab\nin the world can do.\n\n00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:38.274\nAn undergraduate can do it.\n\n00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:42.449\nA talented high schooler\nwith some equipment can do it.\n\n00:08:44.484 --> 00:08:46.793\nNow, I'm guessing\nthat this sounds terrifying.\n\n00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:49.515\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:52.429\nInterestingly though,\nnearly every scientist I talk to\n\n00:08:52.453 --> 00:08:56.334\nseemed to think that gene drives were not\nactually that frightening or dangerous.\n\n00:08:56.358 --> 00:08:58.986\nPartly because they believe\nthat scientists will be\n\n00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.214\nvery cautious and responsible\nabout using them.\n\n00:09:01.238 --> 00:09:02.252\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:03.506\nSo far, that's been true.\n\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.956\nBut gene drives also have\nsome actual limitations.\n\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.289\nSo for one thing, they work\nonly in sexually reproducing species.\n\n00:09:10.662 --> 00:09:14.090\nSo thank goodness, they can't be used\nto engineer viruses or bacteria.\n\n00:09:14.114 --> 00:09:17.304\nAlso, the trait spreads\nonly with each successive generation.\n\n00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:19.321\nSo changing or eliminating a population\n\n00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:22.671\nis practical only if that species\nhas a fast reproductive cycle,\n\n00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:25.495\nlike insects or maybe\nsmall vertebrates like mice or fish.\n\n00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:28.657\nIn elephants or people,\nit would take centuries\n\n00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:31.061\nfor a trait to spread\nwidely enough to matter.\n\n00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:37.179\nAlso, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy\nto engineer a truly devastating trait.\n\n00:09:38.037 --> 00:09:39.766\nSay you wanted to make a fruit fly\n\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.345\nthat feeds on ordinary fruit\ninstead of rotting fruit,\n\n00:09:42.369 --> 00:09:45.002\nwith the aim of sabotaging\nAmerican agriculture.\n\n00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:46.556\nFirst, you'd have to figure out\n\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.352\nwhich genes control\nwhat the fly wants to eat,\n\n00:09:49.376 --> 00:09:51.923\nwhich is already a very long\nand complicated project.\n\n00:09:52.447 --> 00:09:55.751\nThen you'd have to alter those genes\nto change the fly's behavior\n\n00:09:55.775 --> 00:09:57.313\nto whatever you'd want it to be,\n\n00:09:57.337 --> 00:10:00.138\nwhich is an even longer\nand more complicated project.\n\n00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:01.480\nAnd it might not even work,\n\n00:10:01.504 --> 00:10:03.998\nbecause the genes\nthat control behavior are complex.\n\n00:10:04.022 --> 00:10:06.030\nSo if you're a terrorist\nand have to choose\n\n00:10:06.054 --> 00:10:08.412\nbetween starting a grueling\nbasic research program\n\n00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:11.963\nthat will require years of meticulous\nlab work and still might not pan out,\n\n00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:13.334\nor just blowing stuff up?\n\n00:10:13.358 --> 00:10:15.013\nYou'll probably choose the later.\n\n00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:17.876\nThis is especially true\nbecause at least in theory,\n\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.034\nit should be pretty easy\nto build what's called a reversal drive.\n\n00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:24.756\nThat's one that basically overwrites\nthe change made by the first gene drive.\n\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.074\nSo if you don't like\nthe effects of a change,\n\n00:10:27.098 --> 00:10:29.931\nyou can just release a second drive\nthat will cancel it out,\n\n00:10:29.955 --> 00:10:31.105\nat least in theory.\n\n00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.054\nOK, so where does this leave us?\n\n00:10:36.562 --> 00:10:40.157\nWe now have the ability\nto change entire species at will.\n\n00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:42.141\nShould we?\n\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.875\nAre we gods now?\n\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.263\nI'm not sure I'd say that.\n\n00:10:48.052 --> 00:10:49.279\nBut I would say this:\n\n00:10:50.287 --> 00:10:52.145\nfirst, some very smart people\n\n00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:55.025\nare even now debating\nhow to regulate gene drives.\n\n00:10:55.556 --> 00:10:58.120\nAt the same time,\nsome other very smart people\n\n00:10:58.144 --> 00:11:00.255\nare working hard to create safeguards,\n\n00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:03.831\nlike gene drives that self-regulate\nor peter out after a few generations.\n\n00:11:04.602 --> 00:11:05.802\nThat's great.\n\n00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:08.818\nBut this technology still requires\na conversation.\n\n00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:11.747\nAnd given the nature of gene drives,\n\n00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.461\nthat conversation has to be global.\n\n00:11:14.089 --> 00:11:16.796\nWhat if Kenya wants to use a drive\nbut Tanzania doesn't?\n\n00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:20.566\nWho decides whether to release\na gene drive that can fly?\n\n00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:24.786\nI don't have the answer to that question.\n\n00:11:25.576 --> 00:11:27.584\nAll we can do going forward, I think,\n\n00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:30.442\nis talk honestly\nabout the risks and benefits\n\n00:11:30.466 --> 00:11:32.688\nand take responsibility for our choices.\n\n00:11:33.775 --> 00:11:37.688\nBy that I mean, not just the choice\nto use a gene drive,\n\n00:11:37.712 --> 00:11:39.711\nbut also the choice not to use one.\n\n00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:44.046\nHumans have a tendency to assume\nthat the safest option\n\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.862\nis to preserve the status quo.\n\n00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:48.435\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:53.070\nGene drives have risks,\nand those need to be discussed,\n\n00:11:53.094 --> 00:11:56.244\nbut malaria exists now\nand kills 1,000 people a day.\n\n00:11:56.935 --> 00:12:00.499\nTo combat it, we spray pesticides\nthat do grave damage to other species,\n\n00:12:00.523 --> 00:12:02.093\nincluding amphibians and birds.\n\n00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:06.490\nSo when you hear about gene drives\nin the coming months,\n\n00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:08.768\nand trust me, you will\nbe hearing about them,\n\n00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:10.336\nremember that.\n\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.380\nIt can be frightening to act,\n\n00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:14.541\nbut sometimes, not acting is worse.\n\n00:12:16.704 --> 00:12:24.524\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "This is your brain on communication", "duration": "891", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/uri_hasson_this_is_your_brain_on_communication", "transcript": "Imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories, my dreams, my ideas, and transmit them to your brain. That would be a game-changing technology, right? But in fact, we already possess this device, and it's called human communication system and effective storytelling. To understand how this device works, we have to look into our brains. And we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner.Now we have to ask how these neuron patterns in my brain that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains. And we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate. First, your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave that I'm transmitting to your brain. And second, we developed a common neural protocol that enabled us to communicate.So how do we know that? In my lab in Princeton, we bring people to the fMRI scanner and we scan their brains while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories. And to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using, let me play 20 seconds from a story that we used, told by a very talented storyteller, Jim O'Grady.(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good, and then I start to make it better \u2014(Laughter)by adding an element of embellishment. Reporters call this \"making shit up.\"(Laughter)And they recommend against crossing that line. But I had just seen the line crossed between a high-powered dean and assault with a pastry. And I kinda liked it.\"Uri Hasson: OK, so now let's look into your brain and see what's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories. And let's start simple \u2014 let's start with one listener and one brain area: the auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear. And as you can see, in this particular brain area, the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding. Now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listeners in the same brain area. And we can ask: How similar are the responses across all listeners?So here you can see five listeners. And we start to scan their brains before the story starts, when they're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin. As you can see, the brain area is going up and down in each one of them, but the responses are very different, and not in sync. However, immediately as the story is starting, something amazing is happening.(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good, and then I start to make it \u2014UH: Suddenly, you can see that the responses in all of the subjects lock to the story, and now they are going up and down in a very similar way across all listeners. And in fact, this is exactly what is happening now in your brains when you listen to my sound speaking. We call this effect \"neural entrainment.\" And to explain to you what is neural entrainment, let me first explain what is physical entrainment.So, we'll look and see five metronomes. Think of these five metronomes as five brains. And similar to the listeners before the story starts, these metronomes are going to click, but they're going to click out of phase.(Clicking)Now see what will happen when I connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders.(Clicking)Now these two cylinders start to rotate. This rotation vibration is going through the wood and is going to couple all the metronomes together. And now listen to the click.(Synchronized clicking)This is what you call physical entrainment. Now let's go back to the brain and ask: What's driving this neural entrainment? Is it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing? Or maybe it's the words. Or maybe it's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey.So to test it, we did the following experiment. First, we took the story and played it backwards. And that preserved many of the original auditory features, but removed the meaning. And it sounds something like that.(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)And we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people. And as you can see, this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices that process the sounds, but it didn't spread deeper into the brain.Now we can take these sounds and build words out of it. So if we take Jim O'Grady and scramble the words, we'll get a list of words.(Audio) JO: ... an animal ... assorted facts ... and right on ... pie man ... potentially ... my storiesUH: And you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas, but not more than that. Now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them.(Audio) JO: And they recommend against crossing that line. He says: \"Dear Jim, Good story. Nice details. Didn't she only know about him through me?\"UH: Now you can see that the responses in all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar across all listeners. However, only when we use the full, engaging, coherent story do the responses spread deeper into the brain into higher-order areas, which include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex, and make all of them respond very similarly. And we believe that these responses in higher-order areas are induced or become similar across listeners because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker, and not by words or sound. And if we are right, there's a strong prediction over here if I tell you the exact same ideas using two very different sets of words, your brain responses will still be similar.And to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab. We took the English story and translated it to Russian. Now you have two different sounds and linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning. And you play the English story to the English listeners and the Russian story to the Russian listeners, and we can compare their responses across the groups. And when we did that, we didn't see responses that are similar in auditory cortices in language, because the language and sound are very different. However, you can see that the responses in high-order areas were still similar across these two groups. We believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way, as we confirmed, using a test after the story ended.And we think that this alignment is necessary for communication. For example, as you can tell, I am not a native English speaker. I grew up with another language, and the same might be for many of you in the audience. And still, we can communicate. How come? We think we can communicate because we have this common code that presents meaning.So far, I've only talked about what's happening in the listener's brain, in your brain, when you're listening to talks. But what's happening in the speaker's brain, in my brain, when I'm speaking to you? To look in the speaker's brain, we asked the speaker to go into the scanner, we scan his brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story. You have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech are very different processes. Here we're asking: How similar are they? To our surprise, we saw that all these complex patterns within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain. So production and comprehension rely on very similar processes. And we also found the stronger the similarity between the listener's brain and the speaker's brain, the better the communication. So I know that if you are completely confused now, and I do hope that this is not the case, your brain responses are very different than mine. But I also know that if you really understand me now, then your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain are really similar to mine.Now, let's take all this information together and ask: How can we use it to transmit a memory that I have from my brain to your brains? So we did the following experiment. We let people watch, for the first time in their life, a TV episode from the BBC series \"Sherlock,\" while we scanned their brains. And then we asked them to go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person that never watched the movie. So let's be specific. Think about this exact scene, when Sherlock is entering the cab in London driven by the murderer he is looking for.With me, as a viewer, there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when I watch it. Now, the exact same pattern, I can reactivate in my brain again by telling the word: Sherlock, London, murderer. And when I'm transmitting these words to your brains now, you have to reconstruct it in your mind. In fact, we see that pattern emerging now in your brains. And we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have now in your brains when I'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern I had when I watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner. This starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information. Because, for example, now you're listening really hard and trying to understand what I'm saying. And I know that it's not easy. But I hope that at one point in the talk we clicked, and you got me. And I think that in a few hours, a few days, a few months, you're going to meet someone at a party, and you're going to tell him about this lecture, and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us. Now you can see how we can take this mechanism and try to transmit memories and knowledge across people, which is wonderful, right?But our ability to communicate relies on our ability to have common ground. Because, for example, if I'm going to use the British synonym \"hackney carriage\" instead of \"cab,\" I know that I'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience. This alignment depends not only on our ability to understand the basic concept; it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding and shared belief systems. Because we know that in many cases, people understand the exact same story in very different ways.So to test it in the lab, we did the following experiment. We took a story by J.D. Salinger, in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party, and he's calling his best friend, asking, \"Did you see my wife?\" For half of the subjects, we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend. For the other half, we said that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous. This one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair be very similar in these high-order areas and different than the other group. And if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people that think differently than you, think how this effect is going to be amplified in real life, when we are all listening to the exact same news item after being exposed day after day after day to different media channels, like Fox News or The New York Times, that give us very different perspectives on reality.So let me summarize. If everything worked as planned tonight, I used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains. And I used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas into your brains. In this, I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate. And we know that in the future it will enable us to improve and facilitate communication. But these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground. And we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic, and manipulate and control the way we all think. And I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm only a scientist. But maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more natural way of communication, which is a dialogue, in which it's not only me speaking to you now, but a more natural way of talking, in which I am speaking and I am listening, and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas. Because after all, the people we are coupled to define who we are. And our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very early age.So let me finish with an example from my own private life that I think is a good example of how coupling to other people is really going to define who we are.This my son Jonathan at a very early age. See how he developed a vocal game together with my wife, only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being.(Both vocalizing)(Laughter)Now, think how the ability of my son to be coupled to us and other people in his life is going to shape the man he is going to become. And think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and coupling to other people in your life.So keep being coupled to other people. Keep spreading your ideas, because the sum of all of us together, coupled, is greater than our parts.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2495, "subtitle":

memories,\n\n00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.596\nmy dreams, my ideas,\n\n00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.283\nand transmit them to your brain.\n\n00:00:20.713 --> 00:00:23.788\nThat would be a game-changing\ntechnology, right?\n\n00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:26.850\nBut in fact, we already\npossess this device,\n\n00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:29.518\nand it's called human communication system\n\n00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.390\nand effective storytelling.\n\n00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.292\nTo understand how this device works,\n\n00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:36.731\nwe have to look into our brains.\n\n00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:40.341\nAnd we have to formulate the question\nin a slightly different manner.\n\n00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:41.828\nNow we have to ask\n\n00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:44.883\nhow these neuron patterns in my brain\n\n00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:48.109\nthat are associated\nwith my memories and ideas\n\n00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.652\nare transmitted into your brains.\n\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.028\nAnd we think there are two factors\nthat enable us to communicate.\n\n00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:59.107\nFirst, your brain is now\nphysically coupled to the sound wave\n\n00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.606\nthat I'm transmitting to your brain.\n\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.008\nAnd second, we developed\na common neural protocol\n\n00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.790\nthat enabled us to communicate.\n\n00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:08.679\nSo how do we know that?\n\n00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.143\nIn my lab in Princeton,\n\n00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:14.672\nwe bring people to the fMRI scanner\nand we scan their brains\n\n00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:18.596\nwhile they are either telling\nor listening to real-life stories.\n\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.244\nAnd to give you a sense\nof the stimulus we are using,\n\n00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:25.252\nlet me play 20 seconds\nfrom a story that we used,\n\n00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:27.600\ntold by a very talented storyteller,\n\n00:01:27.624 --> 00:01:28.775\nJim O'Grady.\n\n00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:33.535\n(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out\nmy story and I know it's good,\n\n00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.849\nand then I start to make it better --\n\n00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:38.357\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:40.716\nby adding an element of embellishment.\n\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.768\nReporters call this \"making shit up.\"\n\n00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.063\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:50.809\nAnd they recommend\nagainst crossing that line.\n\n00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:56.770\nBut I had just seen the line crossed\nbetween a high-powered dean\n\n00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.220\nand assault with a pastry.\n\n00:01:58.244 --> 00:01:59.736\nAnd I kinda liked it.\"\n\n00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.134\nUri Hasson: OK, so now\nlet's look into your brain\n\n00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:05.386\nand see what's happening\nwhen you listen to these kinds of stories.\n\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.454\nAnd let's start simple -- let's start\nwith one listener and one brain area:\n\n00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:12.967\nthe auditory cortex that processes\nthe sounds that come from the ear.\n\n00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:15.435\nAnd as you can see,\nin this particular brain area,\n\n00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.951\nthe responses are going up and down\nas the story is unfolding.\n\n00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:20.568\nNow we can take these responses\n\n00:02:20.592 --> 00:02:23.393\nand compare them to the responses\nin other listeners\n\n00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:24.892\nin the same brain area.\n\n00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.083\nAnd we can ask:\n\n00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:29.342\nHow similar are the responses\nacross all listeners?\n\n00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:32.338\nSo here you can see five listeners.\n\n00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.394\nAnd we start to scan their brains\nbefore the story starts,\n\n00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:39.957\nwhen they're simply lying in the dark\nand waiting for the story to begin.\n\n00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.135\nAs you can see,\n\n00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.917\nthe brain area is going up and down\nin each one of them,\n\n00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:45.716\nbut the responses are very different,\n\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.407\nand not in sync.\n\n00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:50.137\nHowever, immediately\nas the story is starting,\n\n00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:51.847\nsomething amazing is happening.\n\n00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:55.744\n(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story\nand I know it's good,\n\n00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:57.296\nand then I start to make it --\n\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.617\nUH: Suddenly, you can see\nthat the responses in all of the subjects\n\n00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.793\nlock to the story,\n\n00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:05.246\nand now they are going up and down\nin a very similar way\n\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.824\nacross all listeners.\n\n00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:09.897\nAnd in fact, this is exactly\nwhat is happening now in your brains\n\n00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:12.794\nwhen you listen to my sound speaking.\n\n00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:15.826\nWe call this effect \"neural entrainment.\"\n\n00:03:16.332 --> 00:03:18.644\nAnd to explain to you\nwhat is neural entrainment,\n\n00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:21.278\nlet me first explain\nwhat is physical entrainment.\n\n00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:24.784\nSo, we'll look and see five metronomes.\n\n00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:27.804\nThink of these five metronomes\nas five brains.\n\n00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:30.578\nAnd similar to the listeners\nbefore the story starts,\n\n00:03:30.602 --> 00:03:32.415\nthese metronomes are going to click,\n\n00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.598\nbut they're going to click out of phase.\n\n00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:39.413\n(Clicking)\n\n00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:42.438\nNow see what will happen\nwhen I connect them together\n\n00:03:42.462 --> 00:03:44.603\nby placing them on these two cylinders.\n\n00:03:45.838 --> 00:03:49.059\n(Clicking)\n\n00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.695\nNow these two cylinders start to rotate.\n\n00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.848\nThis rotation vibration\nis going through the wood\n\n00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:57.877\nand is going to couple\nall the metronomes together.\n\n00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:59.513\nAnd now listen to the click.\n\n00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:04.204\n(Synchronized clicking)\n\n00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:12.416\nThis is what you call\nphysical entrainment.\n\n00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.683\nNow let's go back to the brain and ask:\n\n00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:16.851\nWhat's driving this neural entrainment?\n\n00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.660\nIs it simply the sounds\nthat the speaker is producing?\n\n00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:21.007\nOr maybe it's the words.\n\n00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:24.677\nOr maybe it's the meaning\nthat the speaker is trying to convey.\n\n00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:27.461\nSo to test it, we did\nthe following experiment.\n\n00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:30.686\nFirst, we took the story\nand played it backwards.\n\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.836\nAnd that preserved many\nof the original auditory features,\n\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.873\nbut removed the meaning.\n\n00:04:35.897 --> 00:04:37.568\nAnd it sounds something like that.\n\n00:04:37.592 --> 00:04:42.730\n(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)\n\n00:04:43.254 --> 00:04:45.606\nAnd we flashed colors in the two brains\n\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.542\nto indicate brain areas that respond\nvery similarly across people.\n\n00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:50.720\nAnd as you can see,\n\n00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:54.512\nthis incoming sound induced entrainment\nor alignment in all of the brains\n\n00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.268\nin auditory cortices\nthat process the sounds,\n\n00:04:57.292 --> 00:04:59.516\nbut it didn't spread\ndeeper into the brain.\n\n00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.413\nNow we can take these sounds\nand build words out of it.\n\n00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:06.093\nSo if we take Jim O'Grady\nand scramble the words,\n\n00:05:06.117 --> 00:05:07.357\nwe'll get a list of words.\n\n00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:09.643\n(Audio) JO: ... an animal ...\nassorted facts ...\n\n00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:12.559\nand right on ... pie man ...\npotentially ... my stories\n\n00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.525\nUH: And you can see that these words\nstart to induce alignment\n\n00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:18.154\nin early language areas,\nbut not more than that.\n\n00:05:18.178 --> 00:05:21.995\nNow we can take the words\nand start to build sentences out of them.\n\n00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.519\n(Audio) JO: And they recommend\nagainst crossing that line.\n\n00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.621\nHe says: \"Dear Jim,\nGood story. Nice details.\n\n00:05:32.327 --> 00:05:34.479\nDidn't she only know\nabout him through me?\"\n\n00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:37.638\nUH: Now you can see that the responses\nin all the language areas\n\n00:05:37.662 --> 00:05:39.353\nthat process the incoming language\n\n00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:41.756\nbecome aligned or similar\nacross all listeners.\n\n00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:46.853\nHowever, only when we use\nthe full, engaging, coherent story\n\n00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:49.102\ndo the responses spread\ndeeper into the brain\n\n00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:50.657\ninto higher-order areas,\n\n00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:53.782\nwhich include the frontal cortex\nand the parietal cortex,\n\n00:05:53.806 --> 00:05:56.394\nand make all of them\nrespond very similarly.\n\n00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:59.687\nAnd we believe that these responses\nin higher-order areas are induced\n\n00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:01.837\nor become similar across listeners\n\n00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.601\nbecause of the meaning\nconveyed by the speaker,\n\n00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:06.226\nand not by words or sound.\n\n00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:09.308\nAnd if we are right,\nthere's a strong prediction over here\n\n00:06:09.332 --> 00:06:11.694\nif I tell you the exact same ideas\n\n00:06:11.718 --> 00:06:14.362\nusing two very different sets of words,\n\n00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:16.937\nyour brain responses\nwill still be similar.\n\n00:06:17.457 --> 00:06:20.471\nAnd to test it, we did\nthe following experiment in my lab.\n\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.908\nWe took the English story\n\n00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:25.068\nand translated it to Russian.\n\n00:06:25.092 --> 00:06:29.316\nNow you have two different sounds\nand linguistic systems\n\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.634\nthat convey the exact same meaning.\n\n00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:35.306\nAnd you play the English story\nto the English listeners\n\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.682\nand the Russian story\nto the Russian listeners,\n\n00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:40.751\nand we can compare their responses\nacross the groups.\n\n00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.346\nAnd when we did that, we didn't see\nresponses that are similar\n\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.651\nin auditory cortices in language,\n\n00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:49.053\nbecause the language\nand sound are very different.\n\n00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:51.845\nHowever, you can see\nthat the responses in high-order areas\n\n00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.373\nwere still similar\nacross these two groups.\n\n00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:59.118\nWe believe this is because they understood\nthe story in a very similar way,\n\n00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:03.168\nas we confirmed, using a test\nafter the story ended.\n\n00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:07.966\nAnd we think that this alignment\nis necessary for communication.\n\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.616\nFor example, as you can tell,\n\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.667\nI am not a native English speaker.\n\n00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:14.572\nI grew up with another language,\n\n00:07:14.596 --> 00:07:17.250\nand the same might be for many\nof you in the audience.\n\n00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:19.273\nAnd still, we can communicate.\n\n00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:20.448\nHow come?\n\n00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:23.551\nWe think we can communicate\nbecause we have this common code\n\n00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:25.002\nthat presents meaning.\n\n00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:29.325\nSo far, I've only talked about\nwhat's happening in the listener's brain,\n\n00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.596\nin your brain, when\nyou're listening to talks.\n\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.319\nBut what's happening\nin the speaker's brain, in my brain,\n\n00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:36.150\nwhen I'm speaking to you?\n\n00:07:36.174 --> 00:07:38.031\nTo look in the speaker's brain,\n\n00:07:38.055 --> 00:07:41.151\nwe asked the speaker\nto go into the scanner,\n\n00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:42.777\nwe scan his brain\n\n00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.808\nand then compare his brain responses\nto the brain responses of the listeners\n\n00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:48.634\nlistening to the story.\n\n00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:52.868\nYou have to remember that producing speech\nand comprehending speech\n\n00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:54.615\nare very different processes.\n\n00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.883\nHere we're asking: How similar are they?\n\n00:07:58.122 --> 00:07:59.529\nTo our surprise,\n\n00:07:59.553 --> 00:08:04.424\nwe saw that all these complex\npatterns within the listeners\n\n00:08:04.448 --> 00:08:07.155\nactually came from the speaker brain.\n\n00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:10.864\nSo production and comprehension\nrely on very similar processes.\n\n00:08:10.888 --> 00:08:12.460\nAnd we also found\n\n00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:16.190\nthe stronger the similarity\nbetween the listener's brain\n\n00:08:16.214 --> 00:08:17.713\nand the speaker's brain,\n\n00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:19.642\nthe better the communication.\n\n00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:23.631\nSo I know that if you\nare completely confused now,\n\n00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:25.676\nand I do hope that this is not the case,\n\n00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.093\nyour brain responses\nare very different than mine.\n\n00:08:28.117 --> 00:08:31.224\nBut I also know that if you really\nunderstand me now,\n\n00:08:31.248 --> 00:08:34.139\nthen your brain ... and your brain\n... and your brain\n\n00:08:34.163 --> 00:08:35.891\nare really similar to mine.\n\n00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:40.846\nNow, let's take all\nthis information together and ask:\n\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.207\nHow can we use it to transmit\na memory that I have\n\n00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:46.417\nfrom my brain to your brains?\n\n00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:49.113\nSo we did the following experiment.\n\n00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:52.179\nWe let people watch,\nfor the first time in their life,\n\n00:08:52.203 --> 00:08:56.337\na TV episode from the BBC series\n\"Sherlock,\" while we scanned their brains.\n\n00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:59.162\nAnd then we asked them\nto go back to the scanner\n\n00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:03.085\nand tell the story to another person\nthat never watched the movie.\n\n00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:04.769\nSo let's be specific.\n\n00:09:04.793 --> 00:09:06.840\nThink about this exact scene,\n\n00:09:06.864 --> 00:09:09.448\nwhen Sherlock is entering\nthe cab in London\n\n00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:11.768\ndriven by the murderer he is looking for.\n\n00:09:12.356 --> 00:09:14.852\nWith me, as a viewer,\n\n00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:18.376\nthere is a specific brain pattern\nin my brain when I watch it.\n\n00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:22.909\nNow, the exact same pattern,\nI can reactivate in my brain again\n\n00:09:22.933 --> 00:09:26.589\nby telling the word:\nSherlock, London, murderer.\n\n00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:30.437\nAnd when I'm transmitting\nthese words to your brains now,\n\n00:09:30.461 --> 00:09:32.946\nyou have to reconstruct it in your mind.\n\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.519\nIn fact, we see that pattern\nemerging now in your brains.\n\n00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:40.058\nAnd we were really surprised to see\n\n00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:42.337\nthat the pattern you have\nnow in your brains\n\n00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:44.273\nwhen I'm describing to you these scenes\n\n00:09:44.297 --> 00:09:48.119\nwould be very similar to the pattern\nI had when I watched this movie\n\n00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:50.281\na few months ago in the scanner.\n\n00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:52.409\nThis starts to tell you\nabout the mechanism\n\n00:09:52.433 --> 00:09:55.175\nby which we can tell stories\nand transmit information.\n\n00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:57.567\nBecause, for example,\n\n00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:01.103\nnow you're listening really hard\nand trying to understand what I'm saying.\n\n00:10:01.127 --> 00:10:02.677\nAnd I know that it's not easy.\n\n00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:06.737\nBut I hope that at one point\nin the talk we clicked, and you got me.\n\n00:10:06.761 --> 00:10:10.659\nAnd I think that in a few hours,\na few days, a few months,\n\n00:10:10.683 --> 00:10:12.827\nyou're going to meet someone at a party,\n\n00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:16.399\nand you're going to tell him\nabout this lecture,\n\n00:10:16.423 --> 00:10:20.061\nand suddenly it will be as if\nhe is standing now here with us.\n\n00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:22.935\nNow you can see\nhow we can take this mechanism\n\n00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:26.890\nand try to transmit memories\nand knowledge across people,\n\n00:10:26.914 --> 00:10:28.961\nwhich is wonderful, right?\n\n00:10:28.985 --> 00:10:32.152\nBut our ability to communicate\nrelies on our ability\n\n00:10:32.176 --> 00:10:34.742\nto have common ground.\n\n00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:35.971\nBecause, for example,\n\n00:10:35.995 --> 00:10:39.762\nif I'm going to use the British synonym\n\n00:10:39.786 --> 00:10:42.164\n\"hackney carriage\" instead of \"cab,\"\n\n00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:46.227\nI know that I'm going to be misaligned\nwith most of you in the audience.\n\n00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:48.869\nThis alignment depends\nnot only on our ability\n\n00:10:48.893 --> 00:10:50.927\nto understand the basic concept;\n\n00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:55.746\nit also depends on our ability to develop\ncommon ground and understanding\n\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.557\nand shared belief systems.\n\n00:10:57.581 --> 00:10:59.415\nBecause we know that in many cases,\n\n00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:03.482\npeople understand the exact\nsame story in very different ways.\n\n00:11:04.418 --> 00:11:07.459\nSo to test it in the lab,\nwe did the following experiment.\n\n00:11:08.047 --> 00:11:10.978\nWe took a story by J.D. Salinger,\n\n00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:15.337\nin which a husband lost track\nof his wife in the middle of a party,\n\n00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:19.048\nand he's calling his best friend, asking,\n\"Did you see my wife?\"\n\n00:11:19.794 --> 00:11:21.001\nFor half of the subjects,\n\n00:11:21.025 --> 00:11:25.166\nwe said that the wife was having\nan affair with the best friend.\n\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.341\nFor the other half,\n\n00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:31.470\nwe said that the wife is loyal\nand the husband is very jealous.\n\n00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:34.773\nThis one sentence before the story started\n\n00:11:34.797 --> 00:11:37.098\nwas enough to make the brain responses\n\n00:11:37.122 --> 00:11:40.166\nof all the people that believed\nthe wife was having an affair\n\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.627\nbe very similar in these high-order areas\n\n00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:44.873\nand different than the other group.\n\n00:11:44.897 --> 00:11:48.570\nAnd if one sentence is enough\nto make your brain similar\n\n00:11:48.594 --> 00:11:50.197\nto people that think like you\n\n00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:53.174\nand very different than people\nthat think differently than you,\n\n00:11:53.198 --> 00:11:56.675\nthink how this effect is going\nto be amplified in real life,\n\n00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:59.591\nwhen we are all listening\nto the exact same news item\n\n00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:03.363\nafter being exposed\nday after day after day\n\n00:12:03.387 --> 00:12:07.199\nto different media channels,\nlike Fox News or The New York Times,\n\n00:12:07.223 --> 00:12:10.336\nthat give us very different\nperspectives on reality.\n\n00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:12.867\nSo let me summarize.\n\n00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:15.576\nIf everything worked as planned tonight,\n\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.899\nI used my ability to vocalize sound\nto be coupled to your brains.\n\n00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:21.426\nAnd I used this coupling\n\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.291\nto transmit my brain patterns associated\nwith my memories and ideas\n\n00:12:25.315 --> 00:12:26.631\ninto your brains.\n\n00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:30.957\nIn this, I start to reveal\nthe hidden neural mechanism\n\n00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:32.616\nby which we communicate.\n\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.607\nAnd we know that in the future\nit will enable us to improve\n\n00:12:35.631 --> 00:12:37.621\nand facilitate communication.\n\n00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:39.763\nBut these studies also reveal\n\n00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:43.779\nthat communication relies\non a common ground.\n\n00:12:43.803 --> 00:12:46.265\nAnd we have to be\nreally worried as a society\n\n00:12:46.289 --> 00:12:50.325\nif we lose this common ground\nand our ability to speak with people\n\n00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:52.466\nthat are slightly different than us\n\n00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.878\nbecause we let a few very strong\nmedia channels\n\n00:12:55.902 --> 00:12:57.443\ntake control of the mic,\n\n00:12:57.467 --> 00:13:01.242\nand manipulate and control\nthe way we all think.\n\n00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:04.167\nAnd I'm not sure how to fix it\nbecause I'm only a scientist.\n\n00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:06.651\nBut maybe one way to do it\n\n00:13:06.675 --> 00:13:09.322\nis to go back to the more\nnatural way of communication,\n\n00:13:09.346 --> 00:13:10.948\nwhich is a dialogue,\n\n00:13:10.972 --> 00:13:13.479\nin which it's not only me\nspeaking to you now,\n\n00:13:13.952 --> 00:13:16.168\nbut a more natural way of talking,\n\n00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:19.469\nin which I am speaking and I am listening,\n\n00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:24.213\nand together we are trying to come\nto a common ground and new ideas.\n\n00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:25.395\nBecause after all,\n\n00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:29.083\nthe people we are coupled to\ndefine who we are.\n\n00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:31.496\nAnd our desire to be coupled\nto another brain\n\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.037\nis something very basic\nthat starts at a very early age.\n\n00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:40.248\nSo let me finish with an example\nfrom my own private life\n\n00:13:41.002 --> 00:13:45.313\nthat I think is a good example\nof how coupling to other people\n\n00:13:45.337 --> 00:13:47.611\nis really going to define who we are.\n\n00:13:48.252 --> 00:13:51.326\nThis my son Jonathan at a very early age.\n\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.500\nSee how he developed\na vocal game together with my wife,\n\n00:13:55.524 --> 00:14:00.755\nonly from the desire and pure joy\nof being coupled to another human being.\n\n00:14:01.514 --> 00:14:06.431\n(Both vocalizing)\n\n00:14:14.873 --> 00:14:17.201\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:17.225 --> 00:14:21.022\nNow, think how the ability of my son\n\n00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:23.808\nto be coupled to us\nand other people in his life\n\n00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:26.690\nis going to shape the man\nhe is going to become.\n\n00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:29.129\nAnd think how you change on a daily basis\n\n00:14:29.153 --> 00:14:33.476\nfrom the interaction and coupling\nto other people in your life.\n\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.623\nSo keep being coupled to other people.\n\n00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:38.664\nKeep spreading your ideas,\n\n00:14:38.688 --> 00:14:41.932\nbecause the sum of all of us\ntogether, coupled,\n\n00:14:41.956 --> 00:14:43.550\nis greater than our parts.\n\n00:14:43.574 --> 00:14:44.740\nThank you.\n\n00:14:44.764 --> 00:14:50.426\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "An artist's unflinching look at racial violence", "duration": "259", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sanford_biggers_an_artist_s_unflinching_look_at_racial_violence", "transcript": "As a conceptual artist, I'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations. I do this though painting, sculpture, video and performance. But regardless of the format, two of my favorite materials are history and dialogue.In 2007, I created \"Lotus,\" a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter, 600-pound glass depiction of a lotus blossom. In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence and for purity of mind and spirit. But a closer look at this lotus reveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship. This iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery. In America, we don't like to talk about slavery, nor do we look at it as a global industry. But by using this Buddhist symbol, I hope to universalize and transcend the history and trauma of black America and encourage discussions about our shared past.To create \"Lotus,\" we carved over 6,000 figures. And this later led to a commission by the City of New York to create a 28-foot version in steel as a permanent installation at the Eagle Academy for Young Men, a school for black and latino students, the two groups most affected by this history. The same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon, but let me digress.I've been collecting wooden African figures from tourist shops and flea markets around the world. The authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable, but people believe these to be imbued with power, or even magic. Only recently have I figured out how to use this in my own work.(Gun shots)Since 2012, the world has witnessed the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice and literally countless other unarmed black citizens at the hands of the police, who frequently walk away with no punishment at all. In consideration of these victims and the several times that even I, a law-abiding, Ivy League professor, have been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police. I created this body of work simply entitled \"BAM.\"It was important to erase the identity of each of these figures, to make them all look the same and easier to disregard. To do this, I dip them in a thick, brown wax before taking them to a shooting range where I re-sculpted them using bullets. And it was fun, playing with big guns and high-speed video cameras. But my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger, somehow feeling as if I would be shooting myself. Finally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots. I then took the fragments of these and created molds, and cast them first in wax, and finally in bronze like the image you see here, which bears the marks of its violent creation like battle wounds or scars.When I showed this work recently in Miami, a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul. But she also felt that these artworks memorialized the victims of these killings as well as other victims of racial violence throughout US history.But \"Lotus\" and \"BAM\" are larger than just US history. While showing in Berlin last year, a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings. I showed him a photo of a lynching postcard from the early 1900s and reminded him that these killings have been going on for over 500 years. But it's only through questions like his and more thoughtful dialogue about history and race can we evolve as individuals and society.I hope my artwork creates a safe space for this type of honest exchange and an opportunity for people to engage one another in real and necessary conversation.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2496, "subtitle":

transcendence\n\n00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:41.816\nand for purity of mind and spirit.\n\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.261\nBut a closer look at this lotus\n\n00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.499\nreveals each petal\nto be the cross-section of a slave ship.\n\n00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.618\nThis iconic diagram was taken\nfrom a British slaving manual\n\n00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:55.475\nand later used by abolitionists to show\nthe atrocities of slavery.\n\n00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:58.467\nIn America, we don't like\nto talk about slavery,\n\n00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.331\nnor do we look at it as a global industry.\n\n00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:02.983\nBut by using this Buddhist symbol,\n\n00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.610\nI hope to universalize and transcend\n\n00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:08.023\nthe history and trauma of black America\n\n00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:11.411\nand encourage discussions\nabout our shared past.\n\n00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:16.086\nTo create \"Lotus,\"\nwe carved over 6,000 figures.\n\n00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:19.150\nAnd this later led to a commission\nby the City of New York\n\n00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:21.428\nto create a 28-foot version in steel\n\n00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:24.894\nas a permanent installation\nat the Eagle Academy for Young Men,\n\n00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.056\na school for black and latino students,\n\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.753\nthe two groups most affected\nby this history.\n\n00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:33.753\nThe same two groups are very affected\nby a more recent phenomenon,\n\n00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:35.400\nbut let me digress.\n\n00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:37.965\nI've been collecting\nwooden African figures\n\n00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.473\nfrom tourist shops and flea markets\naround the world.\n\n00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:43.579\nThe authenticity and origin\nof them is completely debatable,\n\n00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.261\nbut people believe these\nto be imbued with power,\n\n00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:47.617\nor even magic.\n\n00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.767\nOnly recently have I figured out\nhow to use this in my own work.\n\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.179\n(Gun shots)\n\n00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:09.379\nSince 2012, the world has witnessed\nthe killings of Trayvon Martin,\n\n00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:13.143\nMichael Brown, Eric Garner,\nSandra Bland, Tamir Rice\n\n00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.127\nand literally countless other\nunarmed black citizens\n\n00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:17.580\nat the hands of the police,\n\n00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.412\nwho frequently walk away\nwith no punishment at all.\n\n00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:22.762\nIn consideration of these victims\n\n00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:24.596\nand the several times that even I,\n\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.093\na law-abiding, Ivy League professor,\n\n00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:30.581\nhave been targeted and harassed\nat gunpoint by the police.\n\n00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:34.259\nI created this body of work\nsimply entitled \"BAM.\"\n\n00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:39.846\nIt was important to erase\nthe identity of each of these figures,\n\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.619\nto make them all look the same\nand easier to disregard.\n\n00:02:43.643 --> 00:02:45.843\nTo do this, I dip them in a thick,\nbrown wax\n\n00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:47.830\nbefore taking them to a shooting range\n\n00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:50.652\nwhere I re-sculpted them using bullets.\n\n00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:52.237\nAnd it was fun,\n\n00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.098\nplaying with big guns and\nhigh-speed video cameras.\n\n00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:58.779\nBut my reverence for these figures\nkept me from actually pulling the trigger,\n\n00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.461\nsomehow feeling as if I would\nbe shooting myself.\n\n00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:05.183\nFinally, my cameraman, Raul,\nfired the shots.\n\n00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:08.330\nI then took the fragments of these\n\n00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.882\nand created molds,\nand cast them first in wax,\n\n00:03:12.707 --> 00:03:15.810\nand finally in bronze\nlike the image you see here,\n\n00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:17.938\nwhich bears the marks\nof its violent creation\n\n00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:19.770\nlike battle wounds or scars.\n\n00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:22.549\nWhen I showed this work recently in Miami,\n\n00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:25.358\na woman told me she felt\nevery gun shot to her soul.\n\n00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:27.973\nBut she also felt that these artworks\n\n00:03:27.997 --> 00:03:29.997\nmemorialized the victims of these killings\n\n00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:33.210\nas well as other victims of\nracial violence throughout US history.\n\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.804\nBut \"Lotus\" and \"BAM\" are larger\nthan just US history.\n\n00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:38.692\nWhile showing in Berlin last year,\n\n00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:42.277\na philosophy student asked me\nwhat prompted these recent killings.\n\n00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:44.919\nI showed him a photo\nof a lynching postcard\n\n00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:46.308\nfrom the early 1900s\n\n00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:51.404\nand reminded him that these killings\nhave been going on for over 500 years.\n\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.786\nBut it's only through questions like his\n\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.652\nand more thoughtful dialogue\nabout history and race\n\n00:03:56.676 --> 00:03:59.254\ncan we evolve as individuals and society.\n\n00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.500\nI hope my artwork creates a safe space\n\n00:04:02.524 --> 00:04:04.936\nfor this type of honest exchange\n\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.699\nand an opportunity for people\nto engage one another\n\n00:04:07.723 --> 00:04:10.611\nin real and necessary conversation.\n\n00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.859\nThank you.\n\n00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:18.346\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "This tiny particle could roam your body to find tumors", "duration": "643", "url":

That made it so that a computer the size of an entire room now fits in your pocket. You might say the future is small.As an engineer, I'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers. As a physician, I wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost due to one of the fastest-growing diseases on Earth: cancer. Now when I say that, what most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer. And we are. But it turns out that there's an incredible opportunity to save lives through the early detection and prevention of cancer.Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today. Things like vaccination, timely screening and of course, stopping smoking. But even with the best tools and technologies that we have today, some tumors can't be detected until 10 years after they've started growing, when they are 50 million cancer cells strong. What if we had better technologies to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner, when they could be removed, when they were just getting started?Let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there. This is a microscope in a typical lab that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen, like a biopsy or a pap smear. This $7,000 microscope would be used by somebody with years of specialized training to spot cancer cells. This is an image from a colleague of mine at Rice University, Rebecca Richards-Kortum. What she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope into this $10 part, and it fits on the end of an optical fiber. Now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient and sending it to the microscope, you can bring the microscope to the patient. And then, instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images, you can train the computer to score normal versus cancerous cells.Now this is important, because what they found working in rural communities, is that even when they have a mobile screening van that can go out into the community and perform exams and collect samples and send them to the central hospital for analysis, that days later, women get a call with an abnormal test result and they're asked to come in. Fully half of them don't turn up because they can't afford the trip. With the integrated microscope and computer analysis, Rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup. And what that means is that they can do a diagnosis and perform therapy on the spot, so no one is lost to follow up.That's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives. Now as engineers, we think of this as straight-up miniaturization. You took a big thing and you made it little. But what I told you before about computers was that they transformed our lives when they became small enough for us to take them everywhere. So what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine? Well, what if you had a detector that was so small that it could circulate in your body, find the tumor all by itself and send a signal to the outside world? It sounds a little bit like science fiction. But actually, nanotechnology allows us to do just that. Nanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector from the width of a human hair, which is 100 microns, to a thousand times smaller, which is 100 nanometers. And that has profound implications.It turns out that materials actually change their properties at the nanoscale. You take a common material like gold, and you grind it into dust, into gold nanoparticles, and it changes from looking gold to looking red. If you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide \u2014 forms a big, black crystal \u2014 if you make nanocrystals out of this material and you put it in a liquid, and you shine light on it, they glow. And they glow blue, green, yellow, orange, red, depending only on their size. It's wild! Can you imagine an object like that in the macro world? It would be like all the denim jeans in your closet are all made of cotton, but they are different colors depending only on their size.(Laughter)So as a physician, what's just as interesting to me is that it's not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale; the way they travel in your body also changes. And this is the kind of observation that we're going to use to make a better cancer detector.So let me show you what I mean. This is a blood vessel in the body. Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor. We're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel and watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor. Now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky, and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor. Whether they leak out depends on their size. So in this image, the smaller, hundred-nanometer, blue nanoparticles are leaking out, and the larger, 500-nanometer, red nanoparticles are stuck in the bloodstream. So that means as an engineer, depending on how big or small I make a material, I can change where it goes in your body.In my lab, we recently made a cancer nanodetector that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors. We designed it to listen for tumor invasion: the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread. For a tumor to break out of the tissue that it's born in, it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues. We designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes. One enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour. Now in engineering, we call that one-to-a-thousand ratio a form of amplification, and it makes something ultrasensitive. So we've made an ultrasensitive cancer detector.OK, but how do I get this activated signal to the outside world, where I can act on it? For this, we're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology, and that has to do with the kidney. The kidney is a filter. Its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine. It turns out that what the kidney filters is also dependent on size. So in this image, what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood, through the kidney, into the urine, and everything else that's bigger is retained. OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector, I inject it in the bloodstream, it can leak into the tumor where it's activated by tumor enzymes to release a small signal that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine, I have a signal in the outside world that I can detect.OK, but there's one more problem. This is a tiny little signal, so how do I detect it? Well, the signal is just a molecule. They're molecules that we designed as engineers. They're completely synthetic, and we can design them so they are compatible with our tool of choice. If we want to use a really sensitive, fancy instrument called a mass spectrometer, then we make a molecule with a unique mass. Or maybe we want make something that's more inexpensive and portable. Then we make molecules that we can trap on paper, like a pregnancy test. In fact, there's a whole world of paper tests that are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics.Alright, where are we going with this? What I'm going to tell you next, as a lifelong researcher, represents a dream of mine. I can't say that's it's a promise; it's a dream. But I think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward, even \u2014 and maybe especially \u2014 cancer researchers.I'm going to tell you what I hope will happen with my technology, that my team and I will put our hearts and souls into making a reality. OK, here goes. I dream that one day, instead of going into an expensive screening facility to get a colonoscopy, or a mammogram, or a pap smear, that you could get a shot, wait an hour, and do a urine test on a paper strip. I imagine that this could even happen without the need for steady electricity, or a medical professional in the room. Maybe they could be far away and connected only by the image on a smartphone.Now I know this sounds like a dream, but in the lab we already have this working in mice, where it works better than existing methods for the detection of lung, colon and ovarian cancer. And I hope that what this means is that one day we can detect tumors in patients sooner than 10 years after they've started growing, in all walks of life, all around the globe, and that this would lead to earlier treatments, and that we could save more lives than we can today, with early detection.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2498, "subtitle":

00:03:28.764\nBut what I told you before about computers\n\n00:03:28.788 --> 00:03:31.034\nwas that they transformed our lives\n\n00:03:31.058 --> 00:03:35.359\nwhen they became small enough\nfor us to take them everywhere.\n\n00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:40.039\nSo what is the transformational\nequivalent like that in medicine?\n\n00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:43.594\nWell, what if you had a detector\n\n00:03:43.618 --> 00:03:47.880\nthat was so small that it could\ncirculate in your body,\n\n00:03:47.904 --> 00:03:50.317\nfind the tumor all by itself\n\n00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:52.710\nand send a signal to the outside world?\n\n00:03:53.037 --> 00:03:55.114\nIt sounds a little bit\nlike science fiction.\n\n00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:59.041\nBut actually, nanotechnology\nallows us to do just that.\n\n00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:04.254\nNanotechnology allows us to shrink\nthe parts that make up the detector\n\n00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:06.115\nfrom the width of a human hair,\n\n00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.799\nwhich is 100 microns,\n\n00:04:07.823 --> 00:04:10.378\nto a thousand times smaller,\n\n00:04:10.402 --> 00:04:12.304\nwhich is 100 nanometers.\n\n00:04:12.328 --> 00:04:15.138\nAnd that has profound implications.\n\n00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:19.184\nIt turns out that materials\nactually change their properties\n\n00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:20.804\nat the nanoscale.\n\n00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:23.735\nYou take a common material like gold,\n\n00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.080\nand you grind it into dust,\ninto gold nanoparticles,\n\n00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:30.416\nand it changes from looking\ngold to looking red.\n\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.853\nIf you take a more exotic material\nlike cadmium selenide --\n\n00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:37.051\nforms a big, black crystal --\n\n00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.676\nif you make nanocrystals\nout of this material\n\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.273\nand you put it in a liquid,\n\n00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:43.121\nand you shine light on it,\n\n00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:44.311\nthey glow.\n\n00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:49.966\nAnd they glow blue, green,\nyellow, orange, red,\n\n00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.265\ndepending only on their size.\n\n00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:56.848\nIt's wild! Can you imagine an object\nlike that in the macro world?\n\n00:04:56.872 --> 00:05:03.443\nIt would be like all the denim jeans\nin your closet are all made of cotton,\n\n00:05:03.467 --> 00:05:07.778\nbut they are different colors\ndepending only on their size.\n\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.866\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.464\nSo as a physician,\n\n00:05:12.488 --> 00:05:14.712\nwhat's just as interesting to me\n\n00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:17.036\nis that it's not just\nthe color of materials\n\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.991\nthat changes at the nanoscale;\n\n00:05:19.015 --> 00:05:22.623\nthe way they travel\nin your body also changes.\n\n00:05:23.095 --> 00:05:25.894\nAnd this is the kind of observation\nthat we're going to use\n\n00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:28.092\nto make a better cancer detector.\n\n00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:29.869\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n00:05:30.644 --> 00:05:32.841\nThis is a blood vessel in the body.\n\n00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.276\nSurrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.\n\n00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:38.682\nWe're going to inject nanoparticles\ninto the blood vessel\n\n00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:42.886\nand watch how they travel\nfrom the bloodstream into the tumor.\n\n00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:47.774\nNow it turns out that the blood vessels\nof many tumors are leaky,\n\n00:05:47.798 --> 00:05:52.164\nand so nanoparticles can leak out\nfrom the bloodstream into the tumor.\n\n00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:55.720\nWhether they leak out\ndepends on their size.\n\n00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:57.237\nSo in this image,\n\n00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:01.632\nthe smaller, hundred-nanometer,\nblue nanoparticles are leaking out,\n\n00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:05.052\nand the larger, 500-nanometer,\nred nanoparticles\n\n00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:06.853\nare stuck in the bloodstream.\n\n00:06:06.877 --> 00:06:08.980\nSo that means as an engineer,\n\n00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:12.996\ndepending on how big\nor small I make a material,\n\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.061\nI can change where it goes in your body.\n\n00:06:17.207 --> 00:06:21.849\nIn my lab, we recently made\na cancer nanodetector\n\n00:06:21.873 --> 00:06:27.121\nthat is so small that it could travel\ninto the body and look for tumors.\n\n00:06:27.435 --> 00:06:31.527\nWe designed it to listen\nfor tumor invasion:\n\n00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:36.324\nthe orchestra of chemical signals\nthat tumors need to make to spread.\n\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.792\nFor a tumor to break out\nof the tissue that it's born in,\n\n00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.532\nit has to make chemicals called enzymes\n\n00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:45.140\nto chew through\nthe scaffolding of tissues.\n\n00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:50.443\nWe designed these nanoparticles\nto be activated by these enzymes.\n\n00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:56.904\nOne enzyme can activate a thousand\nof these chemical reactions in an hour.\n\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.978\nNow in engineering, we call\nthat one-to-a-thousand ratio\n\n00:07:01.002 --> 00:07:02.567\na form of amplification,\n\n00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:04.763\nand it makes something ultrasensitive.\n\n00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:08.620\nSo we've made an ultrasensitive\ncancer detector.\n\n00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:14.078\nOK, but how do I get this activated\nsignal to the outside world,\n\n00:07:14.102 --> 00:07:15.840\nwhere I can act on it?\n\n00:07:15.864 --> 00:07:19.416\nFor this, we're going to use\none more piece of nanoscale biology,\n\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.224\nand that has to do with the kidney.\n\n00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:23.533\nThe kidney is a filter.\n\n00:07:23.954 --> 00:07:28.583\nIts job is to filter out the blood\nand put waste into the urine.\n\n00:07:29.155 --> 00:07:31.817\nIt turns out that what the kidney filters\n\n00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.403\nis also dependent on size.\n\n00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:36.799\nSo in this image, what you can see\n\n00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:39.832\nis that everything smaller\nthan five nanometers\n\n00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:43.961\nis going from the blood,\nthrough the kidney, into the urine,\n\n00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:46.655\nand everything else\nthat's bigger is retained.\n\n00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:52.081\nOK, so if I make a 100-nanometer\ncancer detector,\n\n00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.577\nI inject it in the bloodstream,\n\n00:07:54.601 --> 00:08:00.031\nit can leak into the tumor\nwhere it's activated by tumor enzymes\n\n00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:02.411\nto release a small signal\n\n00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:05.657\nthat is small enough to be\nfiltered out of the kidney\n\n00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:07.859\nand put into the urine,\n\n00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:11.924\nI have a signal in the outside world\nthat I can detect.\n\n00:08:12.546 --> 00:08:14.598\nOK, but there's one more problem.\n\n00:08:14.622 --> 00:08:16.368\nThis is a tiny little signal,\n\n00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:18.364\nso how do I detect it?\n\n00:08:18.688 --> 00:08:20.923\nWell, the signal is just a molecule.\n\n00:08:20.947 --> 00:08:23.614\nThey're molecules\nthat we designed as engineers.\n\n00:08:23.638 --> 00:08:26.816\nThey're completely synthetic,\nand we can design them\n\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.079\nso they are compatible\nwith our tool of choice.\n\n00:08:30.103 --> 00:08:33.545\nIf we want to use a really\nsensitive, fancy instrument\n\n00:08:33.569 --> 00:08:35.533\ncalled a mass spectrometer,\n\n00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.068\nthen we make a molecule\nwith a unique mass.\n\n00:08:38.629 --> 00:08:42.328\nOr maybe we want make something\nthat's more inexpensive and portable.\n\n00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:46.135\nThen we make molecules\nthat we can trap on paper,\n\n00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.863\nlike a pregnancy test.\n\n00:08:47.887 --> 00:08:50.513\nIn fact, there's a whole\nworld of paper tests\n\n00:08:50.537 --> 00:08:55.049\nthat are becoming available\nin a field called paper diagnostics.\n\n00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.995\nAlright, where are we going with this?\n\n00:08:58.682 --> 00:09:00.251\nWhat I'm going to tell you next,\n\n00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:02.101\nas a lifelong researcher,\n\n00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.004\nrepresents a dream of mine.\n\n00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:06.447\nI can't say that's it's a promise;\n\n00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:07.963\nit's a dream.\n\n00:09:07.987 --> 00:09:11.574\nBut I think we all have to have dreams\nto keep us pushing forward,\n\n00:09:11.598 --> 00:09:15.535\neven -- and maybe especially --\ncancer researchers.\n\n00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:19.058\nI'm going to tell you what I hope\nwill happen with my technology,\n\n00:09:19.082 --> 00:09:23.173\nthat my team and I will put\nour hearts and souls\n\n00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:24.719\ninto making a reality.\n\n00:09:25.247 --> 00:09:26.945\nOK, here goes.\n\n00:09:26.969 --> 00:09:30.324\nI dream that one day,\n\n00:09:30.348 --> 00:09:33.603\ninstead of going into\nan expensive screening facility\n\n00:09:33.627 --> 00:09:35.132\nto get a colonoscopy,\n\n00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:36.479\nor a mammogram,\n\n00:09:36.503 --> 00:09:37.911\nor a pap smear,\n\n00:09:38.543 --> 00:09:40.262\nthat you could get a shot,\n\n00:09:40.286 --> 00:09:41.946\nwait an hour,\n\n00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.765\nand do a urine test on a paper strip.\n\n00:09:45.611 --> 00:09:48.418\nI imagine that this could even happen\n\n00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:51.105\nwithout the need for steady electricity,\n\n00:09:51.129 --> 00:09:53.733\nor a medical professional in the room.\n\n00:09:53.757 --> 00:09:55.254\nMaybe they could be far away\n\n00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:58.088\nand connected only by the image\non a smartphone.\n\n00:09:58.812 --> 00:10:00.547\nNow I know this sounds like a dream,\n\n00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:03.690\nbut in the lab we already\nhave this working in mice,\n\n00:10:03.714 --> 00:10:05.793\nwhere it works better\nthan existing methods\n\n00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:09.788\nfor the detection of lung,\ncolon and ovarian cancer.\n\n00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:12.795\nAnd I hope that what this means\n\n00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:17.995\nis that one day we can\ndetect tumors in patients\n\n00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:21.312\nsooner than 10 years\nafter they've started growing,\n\n00:10:21.336 --> 00:10:23.321\nin all walks of life,\n\n00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:25.194\nall around the globe,\n\n00:10:25.218 --> 00:10:27.953\nand that this would lead\nto earlier treatments,\n\n00:10:27.977 --> 00:10:31.575\nand that we could save more lives\nthan we can today,\n\n00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:32.883\nwith early detection.\n\n00:10:33.644 --> 00:10:34.826\nThank you.\n\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:42.333\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Can you really tell if a kid is lying?", "duration": "816", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kang_lee_can_you_really_tell_if_a_kid_is_lying", "transcript": "Hi. Let me ask the audience a question: Did you ever lie as a child? If you did, could you please raise your hand? Wow! This is the most honest group of people I've ever met.(Laughter)So for the last 20 years, I've been studying how children learn to tell lies. And today, I'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made.But to begin, I'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina, who is my friend and an elementary school principal. He got a phone call one day. The caller says, \"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny will not come to school today because he's sick.\"Mr. Messina asks, \"Who am I speaking to, please?\"And the caller says, \"I am my father.\"(Laughter)So this story \u2014(Laughter)sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying. One, children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school. Two, children are poor liars. We adults can easily detect their lies. And three, if children lie at a very young age, there must be some character flaws with them, and they are going to become pathological liars for life. Well, it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong.We have been playing guessing games with children all over the world. Here is an example. So in this game, we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards. And we tell them if they win the game, they are going to get a big prize. But in the middle of the game, we make an excuse and leave the room. And before we leave the room, we tell them not to peek at the cards. Of course, we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move. Because the desire to win the game is so strong, more than 90 percent of children will peek as soon as we leave the room.(Laughter)The crucial question is: When we return and ask the children whether or not they have peeked, will the children who peeked confess or lie about their transgression?We found that regardless of gender, country, religion, at two years of age, 30 percent lie, 70 percent tell the truth about their transgression. At three years of age, 50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth. At four years of age, more than 80 percent lie. And after four years of age, most children lie. So as you can see, lying is really a typical part of development. And some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age.So now, let's take a closer look at the younger children. Why do some but not all young children lie? In cooking, you need good ingredients to cook good food. And good lying requires two key ingredients. The first key ingredient is theory of mind, or the mind-reading ability. Mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what I know and what you know. Mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that I know you don't know what I know. Therefore, I can lie to you.The second key ingredient for good lying is self-control. It is the ability to control your speech, your facial expression and your body language, so that you can tell a convincing lie. And we found that those young children who have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars. As it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society. In fact, deficits in mind-reading and self-control abilities are associated with serious developmental problems, such as ADHD and autism. So if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie, instead of being alarmed, you should celebrate \u2014(Laughter)because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone of typical development.Now, are children poor liars? Do you think you can easily detect their lies? Would you like to give it a try? Yes? OK. So I'm going to show you two videos. In the videos, the children are going to respond to a researcher's question, \"Did you peek?\" So try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth. Here's child number one. Are you ready?(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.Kang Lee: And this is child number two.(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.KL: OK, if you think child number one is lying, please raise your hand. And if you think child number two is lying, please raise your hand. OK, so as a matter of fact, child number one is telling the truth, child number two is lying. Looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children's lies.(Laughter)Now, we have played similar kinds of games with many, many adults from all walks of life. And we show them many videos. In half of the videos, the children lied. In the other half of the videos, the children told the truth. And let's find out how these adults performed. Because there are as many liars as truth tellers, if you guess randomly, there's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right. So if your accuracy is around 50 percent, it means you are a terrible detector of children's lies.So let's start with undergrads and law school students, who typically have limited experience with children. No, they cannot detect children's lies. Their performance is around chance.Now how about social workers and child-protection lawyers, who work with children on a daily basis? Can they detect children's lies? No, they cannot.(Laughter)What about judges, customs officers and police officers, who deal with liars on a daily basis? Can they detect children's lies? No, they cannot.What about parents? Can parents detect other children's lies? No, they cannot.What about, can parents detect their own children's lies? No, they cannot.(Laughter) (Applause)So now you may ask why children's lies are so difficult to detect. Let me illustrate this with my own son, Nathan. This is his facial expression when he lies.(Laughter)So when children lie, their facial expression is typically neutral. However, behind this neutral expression, the child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions, such as fear, guilt, shame and maybe a little bit of liar's delight.(Laughter)Unfortunately, such emotions are either fleeting or hidden. Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.So in the last five years, we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions. Then we made a discovery.We know that underneath our facial skin, there's a rich network of blood vessels. When we experience different emotions, our facial blood flow changes subtly. And these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control. By looking at facial blood flow changes, we can reveal people's hidden emotions. Unfortunately, such emotion-related facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye. So to help us reveal people's facial emotions, we have developed a new imaging technology we call \"transdermal optical imaging.\"To do so, we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions. And then, using our image processing technology, we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes. By looking at transdermal video images, now we can easily see facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions. And using this technology, we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying, and therefore detect people's lies. We can do so noninvasively, remotely, inexpensively, with an accuracy at about 85 percent, which is far better than chance level.And in addition, we discovered a Pinocchio effect. No, not this Pinocchio effect.(Laughter)This is the real Pinocchio effect. When people lie, the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases, and the facial blood flow on the nose increases.Of course, lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions. So then we asked ourselves, in addition to detecting lies, how can our technology be used? One application is in education. For example, using this technology, we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience high anxiety about the topic he's teaching so that he can help him. And also we can use this in health care. For example, every day I Skype my parents, who live thousands of miles away. And using this technology, I can not only find out what's going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate, their stress level, their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain. And perhaps in the future, their risks for heart attack or hypertension. And you may ask: Can we use this also to reveal politicians' emotions?(Laughter)For example, during a debate. Well, the answer is yes. Using TV footage, we could detect the politicians' heart rate, mood and stress, and perhaps in the future, whether or not they are lying to us. We can also use this in marketing research, for example, to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products. We can even use it in dating. So for example, if your date is smiling at you, this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you. And in this case, she is just trying to be nice to you.(Laughter)So transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development. Many new applications will come about that we don't know today. However, one thing I know for sure is that lying will never be the same again.Thank you very much.Xi\u00e8 xie.(Applause)", "id": 2501, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.395\nHi.\n\n00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.765\nLet me ask the audience a question:\n\n00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.984\nDid you ever lie as a child?\n\n00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.675\nIf you did, could you please\nraise your hand?\n\n00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:26.557\nWow! This is the most honest\ngroup of people I've ever met.\n\n00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.538\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.271\nSo for the last 20 years,\n\n00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:33.710\nI've been studying\nhow children learn to tell lies.\n\n00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.038\nAnd today, I'm going to share with you\n\n00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:38.224\nsome of the discoveries we have made.\n\n00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:43.507\nBut to begin, I'm going to tell you\na story from Mr. Richard Messina,\n\n00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.660\nwho is my friend and an elementary\nschool principal.\n\n00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:48.785\nHe got a phone call one day.\n\n00:00:51.237 --> 00:00:52.388\nThe caller says,\n\n00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:56.294\n\"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny\nwill not come to school today\n\n00:00:56.318 --> 00:00:57.781\nbecause he's sick.\"\n\n00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:00.192\nMr. Messina asks,\n\n00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:02.230\n\"Who am I speaking to, please?\"\n\n00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:04.236\nAnd the caller says,\n\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.925\n\"I am my father.\"\n\n00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.736\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:11.867\nSo this story --\n\n00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:13.423\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:17.757\nsums up very nicely\nthree common beliefs we have\n\n00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:19.640\nabout children and lying.\n\n00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:24.729\nOne, children only come to tell lies\n\n00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:27.021\nafter entering elementary school.\n\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.821\nTwo, children are poor liars.\n\n00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:32.702\nWe adults can easily detect their lies.\n\n00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:36.764\nAnd three, if children lie\nat a very young age,\n\n00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:39.637\nthere must be some\ncharacter flaws with them,\n\n00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:43.710\nand they are going to become\npathological liars for life.\n\n00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:46.872\nWell, it turns out\n\n00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:49.194\nall of the three beliefs are wrong.\n\n00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:53.285\nWe have been playing guessing games\n\n00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:55.391\nwith children all over the world.\n\n00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.901\nHere is an example.\n\n00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:01.290\nSo in this game, we asked children\nto guess the numbers on the cards.\n\n00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:04.794\nAnd we tell them if they win the game,\n\n00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:06.975\nthey are going to get a big prize.\n\n00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:08.960\nBut in the middle of the game,\n\n00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:11.744\nwe make an excuse and leave the room.\n\n00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:15.655\nAnd before we leave the room,\n\n00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.615\nwe tell them not to peek at the cards.\n\n00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:20.892\nOf course,\n\n00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:23.077\nwe have hidden cameras in the room\n\n00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.896\nto watch their every move.\n\n00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:29.591\nBecause the desire\nto win the game is so strong,\n\n00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:33.101\nmore than 90 percent of children will peek\n\n00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.562\nas soon as we leave the room.\n\n00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.586\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:38.988\nThe crucial question is:\n\n00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:41.760\nWhen we return and ask the children\n\n00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:44.093\nwhether or not they have peeked,\n\n00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:47.169\nwill the children who peeked confess\n\n00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:49.771\nor lie about their transgression?\n\n00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:56.256\nWe found that regardless\nof gender, country, religion,\n\n00:02:56.892 --> 00:02:58.471\nat two years of age,\n\n00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.073\n30 percent lie,\n\n00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:04.906\n70 percent tell the truth\nabout their transgression.\n\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.068\nAt three years of age,\n\n00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:10.566\n50 percent lie and 50 percent\ntell the truth.\n\n00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.159\nAt four years of age,\n\n00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:15.130\nmore than 80 percent lie.\n\n00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:18.743\nAnd after four years of age,\n\n00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:20.156\nmost children lie.\n\n00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:22.501\nSo as you can see,\n\n00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:25.988\nlying is really a typical part\nof development.\n\n00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:28.802\nAnd some children begin to tell lies\n\n00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:31.265\nas young as two years of age.\n\n00:03:32.396 --> 00:03:35.953\nSo now, let's take a closer look\nat the younger children.\n\n00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:41.107\nWhy do some but not all\nyoung children lie?\n\n00:03:42.142 --> 00:03:45.471\nIn cooking, you need good ingredients\n\n00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:47.108\nto cook good food.\n\n00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:52.314\nAnd good lying requires\ntwo key ingredients.\n\n00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:57.177\nThe first key ingredient\nis theory of mind,\n\n00:03:57.201 --> 00:03:59.036\nor the mind-reading ability.\n\n00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:01.804\nMind reading is the ability to know\n\n00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:06.436\nthat different people have\ndifferent knowledge about the situation\n\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.261\nand the ability to differentiate\nbetween what I know\n\n00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:11.508\nand what you know.\n\n00:04:11.872 --> 00:04:14.119\nMind reading is important for lying\n\n00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:17.990\nbecause the basis of lying is that I know\n\n00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:19.165\nyou don't know\n\n00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:20.340\nwhat I know.\n\n00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:21.735\nTherefore, I can lie to you.\n\n00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:27.638\nThe second key ingredient\nfor good lying is self-control.\n\n00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:32.285\nIt is the ability to control your speech,\nyour facial expression\n\n00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:33.849\nand your body language,\n\n00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.951\nso that you can tell a convincing lie.\n\n00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:40.622\nAnd we found that those young children\n\n00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:45.502\nwho have more advanced mind-reading\nand self-control abilities\n\n00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:47.564\ntell lies earlier\n\n00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:50.404\nand are more sophisticated liars.\n\n00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:57.464\nAs it turns out, these two abilities\nare also essential for all of us\n\n00:04:57.488 --> 00:05:00.010\nto function well in our society.\n\n00:05:00.806 --> 00:05:05.141\nIn fact, deficits in mind-reading\nand self-control abilities\n\n00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:08.724\nare associated with serious\ndevelopmental problems,\n\n00:05:08.748 --> 00:05:11.507\nsuch as ADHD and autism.\n\n00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:19.028\nSo if you discover your two-year-old\nis telling his or her first lie,\n\n00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.036\ninstead of being alarmed,\n\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.552\nyou should celebrate --\n\n00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:24.098\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:29.852\nbecause it signals that your child\nhas arrived at a new milestone\n\n00:05:29.876 --> 00:05:31.511\nof typical development.\n\n00:05:33.043 --> 00:05:36.179\nNow, are children poor liars?\n\n00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.830\nDo you think you can easily\ndetect their lies?\n\n00:05:40.703 --> 00:05:42.381\nWould you like to give it a try?\n\n00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.359\nYes? OK.\n\n00:05:44.383 --> 00:05:46.522\nSo I'm going to show you two videos.\n\n00:05:46.982 --> 00:05:48.133\nIn the videos,\n\n00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:51.214\nthe children are going to respond\nto a researcher's question,\n\n00:05:51.238 --> 00:05:52.720\n\"Did you peek?\"\n\n00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:54.298\nSo try to tell me\n\n00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:55.720\nwhich child is lying\n\n00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:57.854\nand which child is telling the truth.\n\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.949\nHere's child number one.\n\n00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.186\nAre you ready?\n\n00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:04.884\n(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.\n\n00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:07.813\nKang Lee: And this is child number two.\n\n00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:11.651\n(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.\n\n00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:16.841\nKL: OK, if you think\nchild number one is lying,\n\n00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:18.552\nplease raise your hand.\n\n00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:23.911\nAnd if you think child number two\nis lying, please raise your hand.\n\n00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.025\nOK, so as a matter of fact,\n\n00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:30.986\nchild number one is telling the truth,\n\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.039\nchild number two is lying.\n\n00:06:34.082 --> 00:06:37.312\nLooks like many of you are terrible\ndetectors of children's lies.\n\n00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:39.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:39.838 --> 00:06:43.222\nNow, we have played similar kinds of games\n\n00:06:43.246 --> 00:06:47.871\nwith many, many adults\nfrom all walks of life.\n\n00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:50.830\nAnd we show them many videos.\n\n00:06:51.305 --> 00:06:53.854\nIn half of the videos, the children lied.\n\n00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:57.145\nIn the other half of the videos,\nthe children told the truth.\n\n00:06:58.487 --> 00:07:01.344\nAnd let's find out\nhow these adults performed.\n\n00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:06.132\nBecause there are as many liars\nas truth tellers,\n\n00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:08.555\nif you guess randomly,\n\n00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:12.649\nthere's a 50 percent chance\nyou're going to get it right.\n\n00:07:12.673 --> 00:07:16.267\nSo if your accuracy is around 50 percent,\n\n00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:19.732\nit means you are a terrible detector\nof children's lies.\n\n00:07:20.248 --> 00:07:24.777\nSo let's start with undergrads\nand law school students,\n\n00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:28.473\nwho typically have\nlimited experience with children.\n\n00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:31.958\nNo, they cannot detect children's lies.\n\n00:07:31.982 --> 00:07:34.196\nTheir performance is around chance.\n\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.449\nNow how about social workers\nand child-protection lawyers,\n\n00:07:39.473 --> 00:07:42.147\nwho work with children on a daily basis?\n\n00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.258\nCan they detect children's lies?\n\n00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:46.733\nNo, they cannot.\n\n00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:47.802\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:49.298\nWhat about judges,\n\n00:07:49.322 --> 00:07:51.122\ncustoms officers\n\n00:07:51.146 --> 00:07:53.004\nand police officers,\n\n00:07:53.028 --> 00:07:55.671\nwho deal with liars on a daily basis?\n\n00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:57.612\nCan they detect children's lies?\n\n00:07:58.758 --> 00:07:59.972\nNo, they cannot.\n\n00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:01.574\nWhat about parents?\n\n00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:04.612\nCan parents detect other children's lies?\n\n00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:07.094\nNo, they cannot.\n\n00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.364\nWhat about, can parents\ndetect their own children's lies?\n\n00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:14.367\nNo, they cannot.\n\n00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:17.867\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:19.438\nSo now you may ask\n\n00:08:20.462 --> 00:08:24.094\nwhy children's lies\nare so difficult to detect.\n\n00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.928\nLet me illustrate this\nwith my own son, Nathan.\n\n00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:30.121\nThis is his facial expression\n\n00:08:30.145 --> 00:08:31.529\nwhen he lies.\n\n00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.759\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:33.783 --> 00:08:35.385\nSo when children lie,\n\n00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.565\ntheir facial expression\nis typically neutral.\n\n00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:42.541\nHowever, behind this neutral expression,\n\n00:08:42.565 --> 00:08:45.891\nthe child is actually experiencing\na lot of emotions,\n\n00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:49.770\nsuch as fear, guilt, shame\n\n00:08:49.794 --> 00:08:52.890\nand maybe a little bit of liar's delight.\n\n00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:55.616\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.480\nUnfortunately, such emotions\nare either fleeting or hidden.\n\n00:09:00.504 --> 00:09:03.603\nTherefore, it's mostly invisible to us.\n\n00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:04.986\nSo in the last five years,\n\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.906\nwe have been trying to figure out a way\nto reveal these hidden emotions.\n\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.444\nThen we made a discovery.\n\n00:09:11.231 --> 00:09:14.416\nWe know that underneath our facial skin,\n\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.834\nthere's a rich network of blood vessels.\n\n00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:20.275\nWhen we experience different emotions,\n\n00:09:20.299 --> 00:09:22.940\nour facial blood flow changes subtly.\n\n00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:27.519\nAnd these changes are regulated\nby the autonomic system\n\n00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:29.712\nthat is beyond our conscious control.\n\n00:09:30.117 --> 00:09:33.940\nBy looking at facial blood flow changes,\n\n00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:36.661\nwe can reveal people's hidden emotions.\n\n00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:41.965\nUnfortunately, such emotion-related\nfacial blood flow changes\n\n00:09:41.989 --> 00:09:44.614\nare too subtle to detect by our naked eye.\n\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.358\nSo to help us reveal\npeople's facial emotions,\n\n00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:52.416\nwe have developed a new imaging technology\n\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.589\nwe call \"transdermal optical imaging.\"\n\n00:09:56.637 --> 00:10:00.590\nTo do so, we use a regular\nvideo camera to record people\n\n00:10:00.614 --> 00:10:03.700\nwhen they experience\nvarious hidden emotions.\n\n00:10:04.343 --> 00:10:08.437\nAnd then, using our image\nprocessing technology,\n\n00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:13.997\nwe can extract transdermal images\nof facial blood flow changes.\n\n00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:20.705\nBy looking at transdermal video images,\n\n00:10:20.729 --> 00:10:22.516\nnow we can easily see\n\n00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:29.326\nfacial blood flow changes associated\nwith the various hidden emotions.\n\n00:10:29.902 --> 00:10:31.690\nAnd using this technology,\n\n00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:36.382\nwe can now reveal the hidden emotions\nassociated with lying,\n\n00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:39.316\nand therefore detect people's lies.\n\n00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.779\nWe can do so noninvasively,\n\n00:10:41.803 --> 00:10:44.342\nremotely, inexpensively,\n\n00:10:44.366 --> 00:10:48.026\nwith an accuracy at about 85 percent,\n\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.104\nwhich is far better than chance level.\n\n00:10:51.058 --> 00:10:54.848\nAnd in addition, we discovered\na Pinocchio effect.\n\n00:10:56.294 --> 00:10:58.349\nNo, not this Pinocchio effect.\n\n00:10:58.373 --> 00:10:59.380\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:59.404 --> 00:11:01.526\nThis is the real Pinocchio effect.\n\n00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.967\nWhen people lie,\n\n00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:06.770\nthe facial blood flow\non the cheeks decreases,\n\n00:11:06.794 --> 00:11:10.055\nand the facial blood flow\non the nose increases.\n\n00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.844\nOf course, lying is not the only situation\n\n00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:17.716\nthat will evoke our hidden emotions.\n\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.614\nSo then we asked ourselves,\n\n00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:21.985\nin addition to detecting lies,\n\n00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:24.342\nhow can our technology be used?\n\n00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:28.531\nOne application is in education.\n\n00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:33.216\nFor example, using this technology,\nwe can help this mathematics teacher\n\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.147\nto identify the student in his classroom\n\n00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:40.916\nwho may experience high anxiety\nabout the topic he's teaching\n\n00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.449\nso that he can help him.\n\n00:11:43.295 --> 00:11:46.035\nAnd also we can use this in health care.\n\n00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:49.427\nFor example, every day I Skype my parents,\n\n00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:51.533\nwho live thousands of miles away.\n\n00:11:52.136 --> 00:11:53.957\nAnd using this technology,\n\n00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.463\nI can not only find out\nwhat's going on in their lives\n\n00:11:57.487 --> 00:12:03.789\nbut also simultaneously monitor\ntheir heart rate, their stress level,\n\n00:12:03.813 --> 00:12:07.038\ntheir mood and whether or not\nthey are experiencing pain.\n\n00:12:07.797 --> 00:12:09.607\nAnd perhaps in the future,\n\n00:12:09.631 --> 00:12:12.920\ntheir risks for heart attack\nor hypertension.\n\n00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:14.919\nAnd you may ask:\n\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:20.911\nCan we use this also to reveal\npoliticians' emotions?\n\n00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:22.475\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:24.353\nFor example, during a debate.\n\n00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:26.631\nWell, the answer is yes.\n\n00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:29.069\nUsing TV footage,\n\n00:12:29.093 --> 00:12:33.139\nwe could detect\nthe politicians' heart rate,\n\n00:12:33.163 --> 00:12:35.209\nmood and stress,\n\n00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:38.811\nand perhaps in the future,\nwhether or not they are lying to us.\n\n00:12:39.453 --> 00:12:42.449\nWe can also use this\nin marketing research,\n\n00:12:42.473 --> 00:12:44.324\nfor example, to find out\n\n00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:48.703\nwhether or not people like\ncertain consumer products.\n\n00:12:49.187 --> 00:12:51.425\nWe can even use it in dating.\n\n00:12:51.862 --> 00:12:53.022\nSo for example,\n\n00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:55.640\nif your date is smiling at you,\n\n00:12:55.664 --> 00:12:58.458\nthis technology can help you to determine\n\n00:12:58.482 --> 00:13:01.089\nwhether she actually likes you\n\n00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:03.288\nor she is just trying to be nice to you.\n\n00:13:03.822 --> 00:13:05.517\nAnd in this case,\n\n00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:07.417\nshe is just trying to be nice to you.\n\n00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:09.833\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:11.202 --> 00:13:14.911\nSo transdermal optical imaging technology\n\n00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:17.513\nis at a very early stage of development.\n\n00:13:17.537 --> 00:13:21.651\nMany new applications will come about\nthat we don't know today.\n\n00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:25.029\nHowever, one thing I know for sure\n\n00:13:25.053 --> 00:13:28.467\nis that lying will never\nbe the same again.\n\n00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:29.649\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:29.673 --> 00:13:30.997\nXi\u00e8 xie.\n\n00:13:31.021 -->

Wow, it's almost a full house. It's true, they are very famous in their fields. And do you know what all of them have in common? They all died of pancreatic cancer. However, although it's very, very sad this news, it's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be.It's become the third cause of cancer deaths, and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years. That's a very tiny number, especially if you compare it with breast cancer, where the survival rate is almost 90 percent. So it doesn't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence. What's shocking, though, is that in the last 40 years, this number hasn't changed a bit, while much more progress has been made with other types of tumors. So how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective? As a biomedical entrepreneur, I like to work on problems that seem impossible, understanding their limitations and trying to find new, innovative solutions that can change their outcome.The first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly, literally. It's depicted in orange on the screen. But you can barely see it until I remove all the other organs in front. It's also surrounded by many other vital organs, like the liver, the stomach, the bile duct. And the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs is the reason why pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types. The hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor from surgically removing it, as is routinely done for breast cancer, for example. So all of these reasons leave chemotherapy as the only option for the pancreatic cancer patient.This brings us to the second piece of bad news. Pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels. Why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor? Let's think for a second how chemotherapy works. The drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site. It's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination. But what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway? You will never get there. And that's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer. The drugs navigate throughout all of your body. They will reach healthy organs, resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall, but very little will go to the tumor. Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.To me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment to target a specific organ. However, in the last 40 years, a lot of money, research and effort have gone towards finding new, powerful drugs to treat pancreatic cancer, but nothing has been done in changing the way we deliver them to the patient.So after two pieces of bad news, I'm going to give you good news, hopefully. With a collaborator at MIT and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer by making localized drug delivery a reality. We are basically parachuting you on top of your destination, avoiding your having to drive all around the highway. We have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one. They are flexible enough that they can be folded to fit into the catheter, so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery. But they are solid enough that once they are positioned on top of the tumor, they will act as a cage. They will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs, controlling the metastasis.The devices are also biodegradable. That means that once in the body, they start dissolving, delivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively than what is done with the current whole-body treatment. In pre-clinical study, we have demonstrated that this localized approach is able to improve by 12 times the response to treatment.So we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most, we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful, reducing the systemic toxic effect. We are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level. We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval for clinical trials.Currently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer. We are hoping that one day, we can reduce their pain, extend their life and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease.By rethinking the way we deliver the drug, we don't only make it more powerful and less toxic, we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions for almost all other impossible problems in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2504, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:15.526\nBy raising your hand,\n\n00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.165\nhow many

it's needed the most,\n\n00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:05.021\nwe allow a response\nthat is 12 times more powerful,\n\n00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:07.806\nreducing the systemic toxic effect.\n\n00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:13.191\nWe are working relentlessly to bring\nthis technology to the next level.\n\n00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:16.062\nWe are finalizing the pre-clinical testing\n\n00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:20.165\nand the animal model required\nprior to asking the FDA for approval\n\n00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.796\nfor clinical trials.\n\n00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:28.058\nCurrently, the majority of patients\nwill die from pancreatic cancer.\n\n00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:29.917\nWe are hoping that one day,\n\n00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:33.212\nwe can reduce their pain,\nextend their life\n\n00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:36.269\nand potentially make pancreatic cancer\n\n00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:37.831\na curable disease.\n\n00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:40.935\nBy rethinking the way we deliver the drug,\n\n00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.716\nwe don't only make it\nmore powerful and less toxic,\n\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.525\nwe are also opening the door\nto finding new innovative solutions\n\n00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:52.264\nfor almost all other impossible problems\n\n00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:55.562\nin pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.\n\n00:05:55.586 --> 00:05:56.747\nThank you very much.\n\n00:05:56.771 --> 00:06:02.208\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Our lonely society makes it hard to come home from war", "duration": "808", "url":

problem. There was something really wrong with me.This was about a year before 9/11, and America wasn't at war yet. We weren't talking about PTSD. We were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war on the human psyche. I'd been in Afghanistan for a couple of months with the Northern Alliance as they were fighting the Taliban. And at that point the Taliban had an air force, they had fighter planes, they had tanks, they had artillery, and we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times. We saw some very ugly things. But I didn't really think it affected me. I didn't think much about it.I came home to New York, where I live. Then one day I went down into the subway, and for the first time in my life, I knew real fear. I had a massive panic attack. I was way more scared than I had ever been in Afghanistan. Everything I was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me, but I couldn't explain why. The trains were going too fast. There were too many people. The lights were too bright. Everything was too loud, everything was moving too quickly. I backed up against a support column and just waited for it. When I couldn't take it any longer, I ran out of the subway station and walked wherever I was going.Later, I found out that what I had was short-term PTSD: post-traumatic stress disorder. We evolved as animals, as primates, to survive periods of danger, and if your life has been in danger, you want to react to unfamiliar noises. You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily. You want to have nightmares and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you. You want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight, or depressed, because it keeps you out of circulation a little bit. Keeps you safe. It's not very pleasant, but it's better than getting eaten.Most people recover from that pretty quickly. It takes a few weeks, a few months. I kept having panic attacks, but they eventually went away. I had no idea it was connected to the war that I'd seen. I just thought I was going crazy, and then I thought, well, now I'm not going crazy anymore.About 20 percent of people, however, wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD. They are not adapted to temporary danger. They are maladapted for everyday life, unless they get help. We know that the people who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD are people who were abused as children, who suffered trauma as children, people who have low education levels, people who have psychiatric disorders in their family. If you served in Vietnam and your brother is schizophrenic, you're way more likely to get long-term PTSD from Vietnam.So I started to study this as a journalist, and I realized that there was something really strange going on. The numbers seemed to be going in the wrong direction. Every war that we have fought as a country, starting with the Civil War, the intensity of the combat has gone down. As a result, the casualty rates have gone down. But disability rates have gone up. They should be going in the same direction, but they're going in different directions.The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced, thank God, a casualty rate about one third of what it was in Vietnam. But they've also created \u2014 they've also produced three times the disability rates. Around 10 percent of the US military is actively engaged in combat, 10 percent or under. They're shooting at people, killing people, getting shot at, seeing their friends get killed. It's incredibly traumatic. But it's only about 10 percent of our military. But about half of our military has filed for some kind of PTSD compensation from the government.And suicide doesn't even fit into this in a very logical way. We've all heard the tragic statistic of 22 vets a day, on average, in this country, killing themselves. Most people don't realize that the majority of those suicides are veterans of the Vietnam War, that generation, and their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related to the war they fought 50 years earlier. In fact, there's no statistical connection between combat and suicide. If you're in the military and you're in a lot of combat, you're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren't. In fact, one study found that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan, you're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later.I studied anthropology in college. I did my fieldwork on the Navajo reservation. I wrote a thesis on Navajo long-distance runners. And recently, while I was researching PTSD, I had this thought. I thought back to the work I did when I was young, and I thought, I bet the Navajo, the Apache, the Comanche \u2014 I mean, these are very warlike nations \u2014 I bet they weren't getting PTSD like we do. When their warriors came back from fighting the US military or fighting each other, I bet they pretty much just slipped right back into tribal life.And maybe what determines the rate of long-term PTSD isn't what happened out there, but the kind of society you come back to. And maybe if you come back to a close, cohesive, tribal society, you can get over trauma pretty quickly. And if you come back to an alienating, modern society, you might remain traumatized your entire life. In other words, maybe the problem isn't them, the vets; maybe the problem is us.Certainly, modern society is hard on the human psyche by every metric that we have. As wealth goes up in a society, the suicide rate goes up instead of down. If you live in modern society, you're up to eight times more likely to suffer from depression in your lifetime than if you live in a poor, agrarian society. Modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse ever in human history. I saw one study that compared women in Nigeria, one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in Africa, to women in North America. And the highest rates of depression were urban women in North America. That was also the wealthiest group.So let's go back to the US military. Ten percent are in combat. Around 50 percent have filed for PTSD compensation. So about 40 percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas but have come home to discover they are dangerously alienated and depressed. So what is happening with them? What's going on with those people, the phantom 40 percent that are troubled but don't understand why?Maybe it's this: maybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness in their unit when they were overseas. They were eating together, sleeping together, doing tasks and missions together. They were trusting each other with their lives. And then they come home and they have to give all that up and they're coming back to a society, a modern society, which is hard on people who weren't even in the military. It's just hard on everybody.And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD. But for a lot of these people, maybe it's not trauma. I mean, certainly, soldiers are traumatized and the ones who are have to be treated for that. But a lot of them \u2014 maybe what's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation. I mean, maybe we just have the wrong word for some of it, and just changing our language, our understanding, would help a little bit. \"Post-deployment alienation disorder.\" Maybe even just calling it that for some of these people would allow them to stop imagining trying to imagine a trauma that didn't really happen in order to explain a feeling that really is happening. And in fact, it's an extremely dangerous feeling. That alienation and depression can lead to suicide. These people are in danger. It's very important to understand why.The Israeli military has a PTSD rate of around one percent. The theory is that everyone in Israel is supposed to serve in the military. When soldiers come back from the front line, they're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment. They're coming back to a community where everyone understands about the military. Everyone's been in it or is going to be in it. Everyone understands the situation they're all in. It's as if they're all in one big tribe.We know that if you take a lab rat and traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself, you can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely. And if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats, after a couple of weeks, it's pretty much OK.After 9/11, the murder rate in New York City went down by 40 percent. The suicide rate went down. The violent crime rate in New York went down after 9/11. Even combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from PTSD said that their symptoms went down after 9/11 happened. The reason is that if you traumatize an entire society, we don't fall apart and turn on one another. We come together. We unify. Basically, we tribalize, and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us, that it even helps people who are struggling with mental health issues. During the blitz in London, admissions to psychiatric wards went down during the bombings.For a while, that was the kind of country that American soldiers came back to \u2014 a unified country. We were sticking together. We were trying to understand the threat against us. We were trying to help ourselves and the world. But that's changed. Now, American soldiers, American veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided that the two political parties are literally accusing each other of treason, of being an enemy of the state, of trying to undermine the security and the welfare of their own country. The gap between rich and poor is the biggest it's ever been. It's just getting worse. Race relations are terrible. There are demonstrations and even riots in the streets because of racial injustice. And veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way \u2014 in fact, any platoon that treated itself that way \u2014 would never survive. We've gotten used to it. Veterans have gone away and are coming back and seeing their own country with fresh eyes. And they see what's going on. This is the country they fought for. No wonder they're depressed. No wonder they're scared.Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets. I think the real question is if we can save ourselves. If we can, I think the vets are going to be fine. It's time for this country to unite, if only to help the men and women who fought to protect us.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2505, "subtitle":

other,\n\n00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.142\nI bet they pretty much just slipped\nright back into tribal life.\n\n00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:05.847\nAnd maybe what determines\n\n00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.565\nthe rate of long-term PTSD\n\n00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.577\nisn't what happened out there,\n\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.305\nbut the kind of society you come back to.\n\n00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:20.019\nAnd maybe if you come back\nto a close, cohesive, tribal society,\n\n00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:23.106\nyou can get over trauma pretty quickly.\n\n00:06:23.788 --> 00:06:28.134\nAnd if you come back\nto an alienating, modern society,\n\n00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:32.182\nyou might remain traumatized\nyour entire life.\n\n00:06:32.206 --> 00:06:35.317\nIn other words, maybe the problem\nisn't them, the vets;\n\n00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:37.105\nmaybe the problem is us.\n\n00:06:39.283 --> 00:06:43.726\nCertainly, modern society\nis hard on the human psyche\n\n00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:46.521\nby every metric that we have.\n\n00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:51.362\nAs wealth goes up in a society,\n\n00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:57.052\nthe suicide rate goes up instead of down.\n\n00:06:58.024 --> 00:07:00.114\nIf you live in modern society,\n\n00:07:00.138 --> 00:07:02.274\nyou're up to eight times more likely\n\n00:07:04.337 --> 00:07:06.658\nto suffer from depression in your lifetime\n\n00:07:06.682 --> 00:07:09.570\nthan if you live in a poor,\nagrarian society.\n\n00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:14.472\nModern society has probably produced\nthe highest rates of suicide\n\n00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:17.750\nand depression and anxiety\nand loneliness and child abuse\n\n00:07:17.774 --> 00:07:19.519\never in human history.\n\n00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:22.226\nI saw one study\n\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.292\nthat compared women in Nigeria,\n\n00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:27.813\none of the most chaotic\nand violent and corrupt\n\n00:07:28.585 --> 00:07:30.791\nand poorest countries in Africa,\n\n00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:32.607\nto women in North America.\n\n00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:37.821\nAnd the highest rates of depression\nwere urban women in North America.\n\n00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:39.840\nThat was also the wealthiest group.\n\n00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:44.444\nSo let's go back to the US military.\n\n00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:47.572\nTen percent are in combat.\n\n00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:52.335\nAround 50 percent have filed\nfor PTSD compensation.\n\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.662\nSo about 40 percent of veterans\nreally were not traumatized overseas\n\n00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:03.998\nbut have come home to discover\nthey are dangerously alienated\n\n00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:05.847\nand depressed.\n\n00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.236\nSo what is happening with them?\n\n00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.077\nWhat's going on with those people,\n\n00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:18.744\nthe phantom 40 percent that are troubled\nbut don't understand why?\n\n00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:20.092\nMaybe it's this:\n\n00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:24.760\nmaybe they had an experience\nof sort of tribal closeness\n\n00:08:24.784 --> 00:08:27.014\nin their unit when they were overseas.\n\n00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:30.666\nThey were eating together,\nsleeping together,\n\n00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.989\ndoing tasks and missions together.\n\n00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.552\nThey were trusting each other\nwith their lives.\n\n00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:38.791\nAnd then they come home\n\n00:08:38.815 --> 00:08:40.815\nand they have to give all that up\n\n00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.548\nand they're coming back\nto a society, a modern society,\n\n00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:49.105\nwhich is hard on people\nwho weren't even in the military.\n\n00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:50.754\nIt's just hard on everybody.\n\n00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:55.375\nAnd we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.\n\n00:08:56.643 --> 00:08:58.335\nBut for a lot of these people,\n\n00:08:59.298 --> 00:09:00.495\nmaybe it's not trauma.\n\n00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:03.074\nI mean, certainly,\nsoldiers are traumatized\n\n00:09:03.098 --> 00:09:05.467\nand the ones who are\nhave to be treated for that.\n\n00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:06.685\nBut a lot of them --\n\n00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:09.939\nmaybe what's bothering them\nis actually a kind of alienation.\n\n00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:13.049\nI mean, maybe we just have\nthe wrong word for some of it,\n\n00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:15.462\nand just changing our language,\nour understanding,\n\n00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:16.660\nwould help a little bit.\n\n00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:19.396\n\"Post-deployment alienation disorder.\"\n\n00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.298\nMaybe even just calling it that\nfor some of these people\n\n00:09:23.592 --> 00:09:26.170\nwould allow them to stop imagining\n\n00:09:26.194 --> 00:09:28.960\ntrying to imagine a trauma\nthat didn't really happen\n\n00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:32.436\nin order to explain a feeling\nthat really is happening.\n\n00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.977\nAnd in fact, it's an extremely\ndangerous feeling.\n\n00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:37.741\nThat alienation and depression\ncan lead to suicide.\n\n00:09:37.765 --> 00:09:39.762\nThese people are in danger.\n\n00:09:39.786 --> 00:09:41.908\nIt's very important to understand why.\n\n00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:47.399\nThe Israeli military has a PTSD rate\nof around one percent.\n\n00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:53.207\nThe theory is that everyone in Israel\nis supposed to serve in the military.\n\n00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:55.341\nWhen soldiers come back\nfrom the front line,\n\n00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:59.803\nthey're not going from a military\nenvironment to a civilian environment.\n\n00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:04.406\nThey're coming back to a community\nwhere everyone understands\n\n00:10:05.656 --> 00:10:06.811\nabout the military.\n\n00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:08.990\nEveryone's been in it\nor is going to be in it.\n\n00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:11.370\nEveryone understands\nthe situation they're all in.\n\n00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:13.663\nIt's as if they're all in one big tribe.\n\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.274\nWe know that if you take a lab rat\n\n00:10:16.298 --> 00:10:19.970\nand traumatize it and put it\nin a cage by itself,\n\n00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:23.151\nyou can maintain its trauma symptoms\nalmost indefinitely.\n\n00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:28.762\nAnd if you take that same lab rat\nand put it in a cage with other rats,\n\n00:10:29.976 --> 00:10:33.332\nafter a couple of weeks,\nit's pretty much OK.\n\n00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:36.729\nAfter 9/11,\n\n00:10:38.507 --> 00:10:41.800\nthe murder rate in New York City\nwent down by 40 percent.\n\n00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:43.646\nThe suicide rate went down.\n\n00:10:44.714 --> 00:10:49.218\nThe violent crime rate in New York\nwent down after 9/11.\n\n00:10:49.242 --> 00:10:54.561\nEven combat veterans of previous wars\nwho suffered from PTSD\n\n00:10:54.585 --> 00:10:59.082\nsaid that their symptoms went down\nafter 9/11 happened.\n\n00:10:59.106 --> 00:11:02.542\nThe reason is that if you traumatize\nan entire society,\n\n00:11:04.408 --> 00:11:07.627\nwe don't fall apart\nand turn on one another.\n\n00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:09.765\nWe come together. We unify.\n\n00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:11.836\nBasically, we tribalize,\n\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.413\nand that process of unifying\nfeels so good and is so good for us,\n\n00:11:17.437 --> 00:11:18.854\nthat it even helps people\n\n00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:22.172\nwho are struggling\nwith mental health issues.\n\n00:11:22.196 --> 00:11:23.961\nDuring the blitz in London,\n\n00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:28.998\nadmissions to psychiatric wards\nwent down during the bombings.\n\n00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:33.786\nFor a while, that was the kind of country\n\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.681\nthat American soldiers came\nback to -- a unified country.\n\n00:11:38.246 --> 00:11:39.517\nWe were sticking together.\n\n00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:42.152\nWe were trying to understand\nthe threat against us.\n\n00:11:42.176 --> 00:11:46.255\nWe were trying to help\nourselves and the world.\n\n00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:49.080\nBut that's changed.\n\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.696\nNow, American soldiers,\n\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.540\nAmerican veterans are coming back\nto a country that is so bitterly divided\n\n00:11:57.674 --> 00:12:01.096\nthat the two political parties\nare literally accusing each other\n\n00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:05.468\nof treason, of being\nan enemy of the state,\n\n00:12:06.223 --> 00:12:10.983\nof trying to undermine the security\nand the welfare of their own country.\n\n00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:15.140\nThe gap between rich and poor\nis the biggest it's ever been.\n\n00:12:15.164 --> 00:12:16.349\nIt's just getting worse.\n\n00:12:16.373 --> 00:12:18.781\nRace relations are terrible.\n\n00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:21.661\nThere are demonstrations\nand even riots in the streets\n\n00:12:21.685 --> 00:12:23.664\nbecause of racial injustice.\n\n00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:28.946\nAnd veterans know that any tribe\nthat treated itself that way -- in fact,\n\n00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.900\nany platoon that treated itself\nthat way -- would never survive.\n\n00:12:35.026 --> 00:12:36.917\nWe've gotten used to it.\n\n00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.794\nVeterans have gone away\nand are coming back\n\n00:12:40.818 --> 00:12:45.259\nand seeing their own country\nwith fresh eyes.\n\n00:12:45.283 --> 00:12:46.940\nAnd they see what's going on.\n\n00:12:47.696 --> 00:12:49.551\nThis is the country they fought for.\n\n00:12:50.391 --> 00:12:52.069\nNo wonder they're depressed.\n\n00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:53.667\nNo wonder they're scared.\n\n00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:59.206\nSometimes, we ask ourselves\nif we can save the vets.\n\n00:13:00.206 --> 00:13:03.376\nI think the real question\nis if we can save ourselves.\n\n00:13:03.863 --> 00:13:05.553\nIf we can,\n\n00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.551\nI think the vets are going to be fine.\n\n00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:11.792\nIt's time for this country to unite,\n\n00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:18.568\nif only to help the men and women\nwho fought to protect us.\n\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.371\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:27.061\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The laws that sex workers really want", "duration": "1070", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/juno_mac_the_laws_that_sex_workers_really_want", "transcript": "I want to talk about sex for money. I'm not like most of the people you'll have heard speaking about prostitution before. I'm not a police officer or a social worker. I'm not an academic, a journalist or a politician. And as you'll probably have picked up from Maryam's blurb, I'm not a nun, either.(Laughter)Most of those people would tell you that selling sex is degrading; that no one would ever choose to do it; that it's dangerous; women get abused and killed. In fact, most of those people would say, \"There should be a law against it!\" Maybe that sounds reasonable to you. It sounded reasonable to me until the closing months of 2009, when I was working two dead-end, minimum-wage jobs. Every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft. I was exhausted and my life was going nowhere. Like many others before me, I decided sex for money was a better option. Now don't get me wrong \u2014 I would have loved to have won the lottery instead. But it wasn't going to happen anytime soon, and my rent needed paying. So I signed up for my first shift in a brothel.In the years that have passed, I've had a lot of time to think. I've reconsidered the ideas I once had about prostitution. I've given a lot of thought to consent and the nature of work under capitalism. I've thought about gender inequality and the sexual and reproductive labor of women. I've experienced exploitation and violence at work. I've thought about what's needed to protect other sex workers from these things. Maybe you've thought about them, too. In this talk, I'll take you through the four main legal approaches applied to sex work throughout the world, and explain why they don't work; why prohibiting the sex industry actually exacerbates every harm that sex workers are vulnerable to. Then I'm going tell you about what we, as sex workers, actually want.The first approach is full criminalization. Half the world, including Russia, South Africa and most of the US, regulates sex work by criminalizing everyone involved. So that's seller, buyer and third parties. Lawmakers in these countries apparently hope that the fear of getting arrested will deter people from selling sex. But if you're forced to choose between obeying the law and feeding yourself or your family, you're going to do the work anyway, and take the risk.Criminalization is a trap. It's hard to get a conventional job when you have a criminal record. Potential employers won't hire you. Assuming you still need money, you'll stay in the more flexible, informal economy. The law forces you to keep selling sex, which is the exact opposite of its intended effect. Being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself. In many places you may be coerced into paying a bribe or even into having sex with a police officer to avoid arrest. Police and prison guards in Cambodia, for example, have been documented subjecting sex workers to what can only be described as torture: threats at gunpoint, beatings, electric shocks, rape and denial of food.Another worrying thing: if you're selling sex in places like Kenya, South Africa or New York, a police officer can arrest you if you're caught carrying condoms, because condoms can legally be used as evidence that you're selling sex. Obviously, this increases HIV risk. Imagine knowing if you're busted carrying condoms, it'll be used against you. It's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home, right? Sex workers working in these places are forced to make a tough choice between risking arrest or having risky sex. What would you choose? Would you pack condoms to go to work? How about if you're worried the police officer would rape you when he got you in the van?The second approach to regulating sex work seen in these countries is partial criminalization, where the buying and selling of sex are legal, but surrounding activities, like brothel-keeping or soliciting on the street, are banned. Laws like these \u2014 we have them in the UK and in France \u2014 essentially say to us sex workers, \"Hey, we don't mind you selling sex, just make sure it's done behind closed doors and all alone.\" And brothel-keeping, by the way, is defined as just two or more sex workers working together. Making that illegal means that many of us work alone, which obviously makes us vulnerable to violent offenders. But we're also vulnerable if we choose to break the law by working together. A couple of years ago, a friend of mine was nervous after she was attacked at work, so I said that she could see her clients from my place for a while. During that time, we had another guy turn nasty. I told the guy to leave or I'd call the police. And he looked at the two of us and said, \"You girls can't call the cops. You're working together, this place is illegal.\" He was right. He eventually left without getting physically violent, but the knowledge that we were breaking the law empowered that man to threaten us. He felt confident he'd get away with it.The prohibition of street prostitution also causes more harm than it prevents. Firstly, to avoid getting arrested, street workers take risks to avoid detection, and that means working alone or in isolated locations like dark forests where they're vulnerable to attack. If you're caught selling sex outdoors, you pay a fine. How do you pay that fine without going back to the streets? It was the need for money that saw you in the streets in the first place. And so the fines stack up, and you're caught in a vicious cycle of selling sex to pay the fines you got for selling sex.Let me tell you about Mariana Popa who worked in Redbridge, East London. The street workers on her patch would normally wait for clients in groups for safety in numbers and to warn each other about how to avoid dangerous guys. But during a police crackdown on sex workers and their clients, she was forced to work alone to avoid being arrested. She was stabbed to death in the early hours of October 29, 2013. She had been working later than usual to try to pay off a fine she had received for soliciting.So if criminalizing sex workers hurts them, why not just criminalize the people who buy sex? This is the aim of the third approach I want to talk about \u2014 the Swedish or Nordic model of sex-work law. The idea behind this law is that selling sex is intrinsically harmful and so you're, in fact, helping sex workers by removing the option. Despite growing support for what's often described as the \"end demand\" approach, there's no evidence that it works. There's just as much prostitution in Sweden as there was before. Why might that be? It's because people selling sex often don't have other options for income. If you need that money, the only effect that a drop in business is going have is to force you to lower your prices or offer more risky sexual services. If you need to find more clients, you might seek the help of a manager. So you see, rather than putting a stop to what's often descried as pimping, a law like this actually gives oxygen to potentially abusive third parties.To keep safe in my work, I try not to take bookings from someone who calls me from a withheld number. If it's a home or a hotel visit, I try to get a full name and details. If I worked under the Swedish model, a client would be too scared to give me that information. I might have no other choice but to accept a booking from a man who is untraceable if he later turns out to be violent. If you need their money, you need to protect your clients from the police. If you work outdoors, that means working alone or in isolated locations, just as if you were criminalized yourself. It might mean getting into cars quicker, less negotiating time means snap decisions. Is this guy dangerous or just nervous? Can you afford to take the risk? Can you afford not to?Something I'm often hearing is, \"Prostitution would be fine if we made it legal and regulated it.\" We call that approach legalization, and it's used by countries like the Netherlands, Germany and Nevada in the US. But it's not a great model for human rights. And in state-controlled prostitution, commercial sex can only happen in certain legally-designated areas or venues, and sex workers are made to comply with special restrictions, like registration and forced health checks. Regulation sounds great on paper, but politicians deliberately make regulation around the sex industry expensive and difficult to comply with. It creates a two-tiered system: legal and illegal work. We sometimes call it \"backdoor criminalization.\" Rich, well-connected brothel owners can comply with the regulations, but more marginalized people find those hoops impossible to jump through. And even if it's possible in principle, getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money. It's not going to be an option for someone who's desperate and needs money tonight. They might be a refugee or fleeing domestic abuse. In this two-tiered system, the most vulnerable people are forced to work illegally, so they're still exposed to all the dangers of criminalization I mentioned earlier.So. It's looking like all attempts to control or prevent sex work from happening makes things more dangerous for people selling sex. Fear of law enforcement makes them work alone in isolated locations, and allows clients and even cops to get abusive in the knowledge they'll get away with it. Fines and criminal records force people to keep selling sex, rather than enabling them to stop. Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers to take dangerous risks and into the arms of potentially abusive managers.These laws also reinforce stigma and hatred against sex workers. When France temporarily brought in the Swedish model two years ago, ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start carrying out vigilante attacks against people working on the street. In Sweden, opinion surveys show that significantly more people want sex workers to be arrested now than before the law was brought in. If prohibition is this harmful, you might ask, why it so popular?Firstly, sex work is and always has been a survival strategy for all kinds of unpopular minority groups: people of color, migrants, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, particularly trans women. These are the groups most heavily profiled and punished through prohibitionist law. I don't think this is an accident. These laws have political support precisely because they target people that voters don't want to see or know about.Why else might people support prohibition? Well, lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking. Folks think that foreign women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery can be saved by shutting a whole industry down. So let's talk about trafficking. Forced labor does occur in many industries, especially those where the workers are migrants or otherwise vulnerable, and this needs to be addressed. But it's best addressed with legislation targeting those specific abuses, not an entire industry. When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants drowned while picking cockles in Morecambe Bay in 2004, there were no calls to outlaw the entire seafood industry to save trafficking victims. The solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections, allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest.The way the term trafficking is thrown around implies that all undocumented migration into prostitution is forced. In fact, many migrants have made a decision, out of economic need, to place themselves into the hands of people smugglers. Many do this with the full knowledge that they'll be selling sex when they reach their destination. And yes, it can often be the case that these people smugglers demand exorbitant fees, coerce migrants into work they don't want to do and abuse them when they're vulnerable. That's true of prostitution, but it's also true of agricultural work, hospitality work and domestic work. Ultimately, nobody wants to be forced to do any kind of work, but that's a risk many migrants are willing to take, because of what they're leaving behind. If people were allowed to migrate legally they wouldn't have to place their lives into the hands of people smugglers. The problems arise from the criminalization of migration, just as they do from the criminalization of sex work itself.This is a lesson of history. If you try to prohibit something that people want or need to do, whether that's drinking alcohol or crossing borders or getting an abortion or selling sex, you create more problems than you solve. Prohibition barely makes a difference to the amount of people actually doing those things. But it makes a huge difference as to whether or not they're safe when they do them.Why else might people support prohibition? As a feminist, I know that the sex industry is a site of deeply entrenched social inequality. It's a fact that most buyers of sex are men with money, and most sellers are women without. You can agree with all that \u2014 I do \u2014 and still think prohibition is a terrible policy. In a better, more equal world, maybe there would be far fewer people selling sex to survive, but you can't simply legislate a better world into existence. If someone needs to sell sex because they're poor or because they're homeless or because they're undocumented and they can't find legal work, taking away that option doesn't make them any less poor or house them or change their immigration status.People worry that selling sex is degrading. Ask yourself: is it more degrading than going hungry or seeing your children go hungry? There's no call to ban rich people from hiring nannies or getting manicures, even though most of the people doing that labor are poor, migrant women. It's the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some feminists uncomfortable. And I can understand why the sex industry provokes strong feelings. People have all kinds of complicated feelings when it comes to sex. But we can't make policy on the basis of mere feelings, especially not over the heads of the people actually effected by those policies. If we get fixated on the abolition of sex work, we end up worrying more about a particular manifestation of gender inequality, rather than about the underlying causes.People get really hung up on the question, \"Well, would you want your daughter doing it?\" That's the wrong question. Instead, imagine she is doing it. How safe is she at work tonight? Why isn't she safer?So we've looked at full criminalization, partial criminalization, the Swedish or Nordic Model and legalization, and how they all cause harm. Something I never hear asked is: \"What do sex workers want?\" After all, we're the ones most affected by these laws.New Zealand decriminalized sex work in 2003. It's crucial to remember that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing. Decriminalization means the removal of laws that punitively target the sex industry, instead treating sex work much like any other kind of work. In New Zealand, people can work together for safety, and employers of sex workers are accountable to the state. A sex worker can refuse to see a client at any time, for any reason, and 96 percent of street workers report that they feel the law protects their rights. New Zealand hasn't actually seen an increase in the amount of people doing sex work, but decriminalizing it has made it a lot safer. But the lesson from New Zealand isn't just that its particular legislation is good, but that crucially, it was written in collaboration with sex workers; namely, the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective. When it came to making sex work safer, they were ready to hear it straight from sex workers themselves.Here in the UK, I'm part of sex worker-led groups like the Sex Worker Open University and the English Collective of Prostitutes. And we form part of a global movement demanding decriminalization and self-determination. The universal symbol of our movement is the red umbrella. We're supported in our demands by global bodies like UNAIDS, the World Health Organization and Amnesty International. But we need more allies. If you care about gender equality or poverty or migration or public health, then sex worker rights matter to you. Make space for us in your movements. That means not only listening to sex workers when we speak but amplifying our voices. Resist those who silence us, those who say that a prostitute is either too victimized, too damaged to know what's best for herself, or else too privileged and too removed from real hardship, not representative of the millions of voiceless victims. This distinction between victim and empowered is imaginary. It exists purely to discredit sex workers and make it easy to ignore us.No doubt many of you work for a living. Well, sex work is work, too. Just like you, some of us like our jobs, some of us hate them. Ultimately, most of us have mixed feelings. But how we feel about our work isn't the point. And how others feel about our work certainly isn't. What's important is that we have the right to work safely and on our own terms.Sex workers are real people. We've had complicated experiences and complicated responses to those experiences. But our demands are not complicated. You can ask expensive escorts in New York City, brothel workers in Cambodia, street workers in South Africa and every girl on the roster at my old job in Soho, and they will all tell you the same thing. You can speak to millions of sex workers and countless sex work-led organizations. We want full decriminalization and labor rights as workers.I'm just one sex worker on the stage today, but I'm bringing a message from all over the world.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2506, "subtitle":

people\nyou'll have heard speaking\n\n00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:19.473\nabout prostitution before.\n\n00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:22.557\nI'm not a police officer\nor a social worker.\n\n00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:25.795\nI'm not an academic,\na journalist or a politician.\n\n00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:29.035\nAnd as you'll probably have\npicked up from Maryam's blurb,\n\n00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.260\nI'm not a nun, either.\n\n00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:31.373\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:35.365\nMost of those people would tell you\nthat selling sex is degrading;\n\n00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.524\nthat no one would ever choose to do it;\n\n00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:40.402\nthat it's dangerous;\nwomen get abused and killed.\n\n00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:42.924\nIn fact, most of those people would say,\n\n00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:44.736\n\"There should be a law against it!\"\n\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.923\nMaybe that sounds reasonable to you.\n\n00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:51.766\nIt sounded reasonable to me\nuntil the closing months of 2009,\n\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.971\nwhen I was working two dead-end,\nminimum-wage jobs.\n\n00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:59.006\nEvery month my wages would just\nreplenish my overdraft.\n\n00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.585\nI was exhausted and my life\nwas going nowhere.\n\n00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:03.991\nLike many others before me,\n\n00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:06.408\nI decided sex for money\nwas a better option.\n\n00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:08.399\nNow don't get me wrong --\n\n00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.830\nI would have loved\nto have won the lottery instead.\n\n00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:12.949\nBut it wasn't going\nto happen anytime soon,\n\n00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.383\nand my rent needed paying.\n\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.311\nSo I signed up for my first\nshift in a brothel.\n\n00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:19.978\nIn the years that have passed,\n\n00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.836\nI've had a lot of time to think.\n\n00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:25.875\nI've reconsidered the ideas\nI once had about prostitution.\n\n00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.804\nI've given a lot of thought to consent\n\n00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:30.057\nand the nature of work under capitalism.\n\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.296\nI've thought about gender inequality\n\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.836\nand the sexual and reproductive\nlabor of women.\n\n00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:38.642\nI've experienced exploitation\nand violence at work.\n\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.675\nI've thought about what's needed\n\n00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:42.929\nto protect other sex workers\nfrom these things.\n\n00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:45.062\nMaybe you've thought about them, too.\n\n00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:46.243\nIn this talk,\n\n00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:48.736\nI'll take you through\nthe four main legal approaches\n\n00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.744\napplied to sex work throughout the world,\n\n00:01:50.768 --> 00:01:52.331\nand explain why they don't work;\n\n00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.513\nwhy prohibiting the sex industry\nactually exacerbates every harm\n\n00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:57.447\nthat sex workers are vulnerable to.\n\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.436\nThen I'm going tell you about what we,\nas sex workers, actually want.\n\n00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.499\nThe first approach\nis full criminalization.\n\n00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:08.034\nHalf the world,\n\n00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:10.552\nincluding Russia, South Africa\nand most of the US,\n\n00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:13.503\nregulates sex work by criminalizing\neveryone involved.\n\n00:02:13.527 --> 00:02:16.655\nSo that's seller, buyer and third parties.\n\n00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:18.764\nLawmakers in these countries\napparently hope\n\n00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:22.660\nthat the fear of getting arrested\nwill deter people from selling sex.\n\n00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.236\nBut if you're forced to choose\nbetween obeying the law\n\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.244\nand feeding yourself or your family,\n\n00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:29.045\nyou're going to do the work anyway,\n\n00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.504\nand take the risk.\n\n00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.445\nCriminalization is a trap.\n\n00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:36.543\nIt's hard to get a conventional job\nwhen you have a criminal record.\n\n00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:38.563\nPotential employers won't hire you.\n\n00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:40.383\nAssuming you still need money,\n\n00:02:40.407 --> 00:02:43.198\nyou'll stay in the more flexible,\ninformal economy.\n\n00:02:43.222 --> 00:02:45.734\nThe law forces you to keep selling sex,\n\n00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:48.709\nwhich is the exact opposite\nof its intended effect.\n\n00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:53.502\nBeing criminalized leaves you exposed\nto mistreatment by the state itself.\n\n00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:56.291\nIn many places you may be coerced\ninto paying a bribe\n\n00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:58.670\nor even into having sex\nwith a police officer\n\n00:02:58.694 --> 00:02:59.883\nto avoid arrest.\n\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.318\nPolice and prison guards\nin Cambodia, for example,\n\n00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:05.366\nhave been documented\nsubjecting sex workers\n\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.679\nto what can only be described as torture:\n\n00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:08.854\nthreats at gunpoint,\n\n00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:11.670\nbeatings, electric shocks, rape\n\n00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:13.134\nand denial of food.\n\n00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:15.271\nAnother worrying thing:\n\n00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:19.694\nif you're selling sex in places\nlike Kenya, South Africa or New York,\n\n00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:23.414\na police officer can arrest you\nif you're caught carrying condoms,\n\n00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:27.440\nbecause condoms can legally be used\nas evidence that you're selling sex.\n\n00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:29.906\nObviously, this increases HIV risk.\n\n00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.390\nImagine knowing if you're busted\ncarrying condoms,\n\n00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:34.268\nit'll be used against you.\n\n00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:37.294\nIt's a pretty strong incentive\nto leave them at home, right?\n\n00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:40.624\nSex workers working in these places\nare forced to make a tough choice\n\n00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:43.409\nbetween risking arrest\nor having risky sex.\n\n00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.322\nWhat would you choose?\n\n00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:47.886\nWould you pack condoms to go to work?\n\n00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:49.707\nHow about if you're worried\n\n00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.696\nthe police officer would rape you\nwhen he got you in the van?\n\n00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:56.766\nThe second approach to regulating\nsex work seen in these countries\n\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.182\nis partial criminalization,\n\n00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:00.758\nwhere the buying and selling\nof sex are legal,\n\n00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.077\nbut surrounding activities,\n\n00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:05.313\nlike brothel-keeping or soliciting\non the street, are banned.\n\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.980\nLaws like these --\n\n00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:08.893\nwe have them in the UK and in France --\n\n00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:10.575\nessentially say to us sex workers,\n\n00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.417\n\"Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,\n\n00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:14.528\njust make sure it's done\nbehind closed doors\n\n00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:16.039\nand all alone.\"\n\n00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:17.848\nAnd brothel-keeping, by the way,\n\n00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:20.911\nis defined as just two or more\nsex workers working together.\n\n00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:23.768\nMaking that illegal means\nthat many of us work alone,\n\n00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:26.615\nwhich obviously makes us\nvulnerable to violent offenders.\n\n00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.869\nBut we're also vulnerable\n\n00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:30.556\nif we choose to break the law\nby working together.\n\n00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:32.537\nA couple of years ago,\n\n00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.430\na friend of mine was nervous\nafter she was attacked at work,\n\n00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:39.143\nso I said that she could see her clients\nfrom my place for a while.\n\n00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:40.389\nDuring that time,\n\n00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.345\nwe had another guy turn nasty.\n\n00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:45.097\nI told the guy to leave\nor I'd call the police.\n\n00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:47.712\nAnd he looked at the two of us and said,\n\n00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:49.846\n\"You girls can't call the cops.\n\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.618\nYou're working together,\nthis place is illegal.\"\n\n00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:53.805\nHe was right.\n\n00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:56.412\nHe eventually left\nwithout getting physically violent,\n\n00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:58.660\nbut the knowledge\nthat we were breaking the law\n\n00:04:58.684 --> 00:05:00.374\nempowered that man to threaten us.\n\n00:05:00.398 --> 00:05:02.399\nHe felt confident he'd get away with it.\n\n00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:05.702\nThe prohibition of street prostitution\nalso causes more harm\n\n00:05:05.726 --> 00:05:06.878\nthan it prevents.\n\n00:05:06.902 --> 00:05:08.894\nFirstly, to avoid getting arrested,\n\n00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:11.181\nstreet workers take risks\nto avoid detection,\n\n00:05:11.205 --> 00:05:12.568\nand that means working alone\n\n00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:14.627\nor in isolated locations like dark forests\n\n00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.703\nwhere they're vulnerable to attack.\n\n00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:18.624\nIf you're caught selling sex outdoors,\n\n00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:19.866\nyou pay a fine.\n\n00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:23.110\nHow do you pay that fine\nwithout going back to the streets?\n\n00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:25.681\nIt was the need for money\nthat saw you in the streets\n\n00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:26.856\nin the first place.\n\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.403\nAnd so the fines stack up,\n\n00:05:28.427 --> 00:05:30.165\nand you're caught in a vicious cycle\n\n00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.549\nof selling sex to pay the fines\nyou got for selling sex.\n\n00:05:34.128 --> 00:05:37.850\nLet me tell you about Mariana Popa\nwho worked in Redbridge, East London.\n\n00:05:37.874 --> 00:05:41.401\nThe street workers on her patch\nwould normally wait for clients in groups\n\n00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:42.721\nfor safety in numbers\n\n00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:45.688\nand to warn each other about how\nto avoid dangerous guys.\n\n00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.768\nBut during a police crackdown\non sex workers and their clients,\n\n00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.772\nshe was forced to work alone\nto avoid being arrested.\n\n00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:57.446\nShe was stabbed to death\nin the early hours of October 29, 2013.\n\n00:05:57.967 --> 00:05:59.772\nShe had been working later than usual\n\n00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:02.850\nto try to pay off a fine\nshe had received for soliciting.\n\n00:06:03.952 --> 00:06:06.687\nSo if criminalizing\nsex workers hurts them,\n\n00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:09.497\nwhy not just criminalize\nthe people who buy sex?\n\n00:06:09.812 --> 00:06:11.650\nThis is the aim of the third approach\n\n00:06:11.674 --> 00:06:12.832\nI want to talk about --\n\n00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:14.944\nthe Swedish or Nordic\nmodel of sex-work law.\n\n00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:16.195\nThe idea behind this law\n\n00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.682\nis that selling sex\nis intrinsically harmful\n\n00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:22.208\nand so you're, in fact, helping\nsex workers by removing the option.\n\n00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:23.960\nDespite growing support\n\n00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.666\nfor what's often described\nas the \"end demand\" approach,\n\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.333\nthere's no evidence that it works.\n\n00:06:28.357 --> 00:06:31.696\nThere's just as much prostitution\nin Sweden as there was before.\n\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.136\nWhy might that be?\n\n00:06:33.997 --> 00:06:35.525\nIt's because people selling sex\n\n00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:37.665\noften don't have other options for income.\n\n00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:38.841\nIf you need that money,\n\n00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:41.347\nthe only effect that a drop\nin business is going have\n\n00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:43.096\nis to force you to lower your prices\n\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.525\nor offer more risky sexual services.\n\n00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:47.122\nIf you need to find more clients,\n\n00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:48.944\nyou might seek the help of a manager.\n\n00:06:48.968 --> 00:06:50.948\nSo you see, rather than putting a stop\n\n00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:52.805\nto what's often descried as pimping,\n\n00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.849\na law like this actually gives oxygen\n\n00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.909\nto potentially abusive third parties.\n\n00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:59.377\nTo keep safe in my work,\n\n00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:01.294\nI try not to take bookings from someone\n\n00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:03.068\nwho calls me from a withheld number.\n\n00:07:03.092 --> 00:07:05.017\nIf it's a home or a hotel visit,\n\n00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:07.210\nI try to get a full name and details.\n\n00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.788\nIf I worked under the Swedish model,\n\n00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:12.510\na client would be too scared\nto give me that information.\n\n00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:13.972\nI might have no other choice\n\n00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:16.947\nbut to accept a booking\nfrom a man who is untraceable\n\n00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:18.908\nif he later turns out to be violent.\n\n00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.005\nIf you need their money,\n\n00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.401\nyou need to protect\nyour clients from the police.\n\n00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:24.582\nIf you work outdoors,\n\n00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:27.169\nthat means working alone\nor in isolated locations,\n\n00:07:27.193 --> 00:07:29.408\njust as if you were criminalized yourself.\n\n00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:32.018\nIt might mean getting into cars quicker,\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:34.587\nless negotiating time\nmeans snap decisions.\n\n00:07:34.973 --> 00:07:37.601\nIs this guy dangerous or just nervous?\n\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.786\nCan you afford to take the risk?\n\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.096\nCan you afford not to?\n\n00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:45.002\nSomething I'm often hearing is,\n\n00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:46.354\n\"Prostitution would be fine\n\n00:07:46.378 --> 00:07:48.759\nif we made it legal and regulated it.\"\n\n00:07:48.783 --> 00:07:50.560\nWe call that approach legalization,\n\n00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:53.380\nand it's used by countries\nlike the Netherlands, Germany\n\n00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:54.996\nand Nevada in the US.\n\n00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:57.721\nBut it's not a great\nmodel for human rights.\n\n00:07:57.745 --> 00:07:59.550\nAnd in state-controlled prostitution,\n\n00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:01.137\ncommercial sex can only happen\n\n00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:03.454\nin certain legally-designated\nareas or venues,\n\n00:08:03.478 --> 00:08:06.468\nand sex workers are made to comply\nwith special restrictions,\n\n00:08:06.492 --> 00:08:09.255\nlike registration\nand forced health checks.\n\n00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:12.121\nRegulation sounds great on paper,\n\n00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:15.425\nbut politicians deliberately make\nregulation around the sex industry\n\n00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:18.116\nexpensive and difficult to comply with.\n\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.484\nIt creates a two-tiered system:\nlegal and illegal work.\n\n00:08:22.508 --> 00:08:25.510\nWe sometimes call it\n\"backdoor criminalization.\"\n\n00:08:25.534 --> 00:08:28.955\nRich, well-connected brothel owners\ncan comply with the regulations,\n\n00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:31.152\nbut more marginalized people\nfind those hoops\n\n00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:33.130\nimpossible to jump through.\n\n00:08:33.154 --> 00:08:35.124\nAnd even if it's possible in principle,\n\n00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:38.133\ngetting a license or proper venue\ntakes time and costs money.\n\n00:08:38.157 --> 00:08:39.636\nIt's not going to be an option\n\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.114\nfor someone who's desperate\nand needs money tonight.\n\n00:08:42.138 --> 00:08:45.180\nThey might be a refugee\nor fleeing domestic abuse.\n\n00:08:45.204 --> 00:08:46.743\nIn this two-tiered system,\n\n00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:50.004\nthe most vulnerable people\nare forced to work illegally,\n\n00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:53.044\nso they're still exposed to all\nthe dangers of criminalization\n\n00:08:53.068 --> 00:08:54.504\nI mentioned earlier.\n\n00:08:54.528 --> 00:08:55.687\nSo.\n\n00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:57.793\nIt's looking like all attempts to control\n\n00:08:57.817 --> 00:08:59.499\nor prevent sex work from happening\n\n00:08:59.523 --> 00:09:02.254\nmakes things more dangerous\nfor people selling sex.\n\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.066\nFear of law enforcement makes them\nwork alone in isolated locations,\n\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.797\nand allows clients and even cops\n\n00:09:07.821 --> 00:09:10.590\nto get abusive in the knowledge\nthey'll get away with it.\n\n00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:13.775\nFines and criminal records force\npeople to keep selling sex,\n\n00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:15.777\nrather than enabling them to stop.\n\n00:09:16.283 --> 00:09:19.060\nCrackdowns on buyers drive sellers\nto take dangerous risks\n\n00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:21.421\nand into the arms\nof potentially abusive managers.\n\n00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:25.212\nThese laws also reinforce stigma\nand hatred against sex workers.\n\n00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:28.585\nWhen France temporarily brought in\nthe Swedish model two years ago,\n\n00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.584\nordinary citizens took it as a cue\n\n00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:32.559\nto start carrying out vigilante attacks\n\n00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:34.722\nagainst people working on the street.\n\n00:09:34.746 --> 00:09:36.744\nIn Sweden, opinion surveys show\n\n00:09:36.768 --> 00:09:40.723\nthat significantly more people want\nsex workers to be arrested now\n\n00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.694\nthan before the law was brought in.\n\n00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.705\nIf prohibition is this harmful,\n\n00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:47.911\nyou might ask, why it so popular?\n\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.733\nFirstly, sex work is and always\nhas been a survival strategy\n\n00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:54.665\nfor all kinds of unpopular\nminority groups:\n\n00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:55.892\npeople of color,\n\n00:09:55.916 --> 00:09:57.067\nmigrants,\n\n00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:58.315\npeople with disabilities,\n\n00:09:58.339 --> 00:09:59.534\nLGBTQ people,\n\n00:09:59.558 --> 00:10:01.255\nparticularly trans women.\n\n00:10:01.882 --> 00:10:03.988\nThese are the groups most heavily profiled\n\n00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:06.338\nand punished through prohibitionist law.\n\n00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:08.338\nI don't think this is an accident.\n\n00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:10.201\nThese laws have political support\n\n00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:12.864\nprecisely because they target people\n\n00:10:12.888 --> 00:10:15.470\nthat voters don't want\nto see or know about.\n\n00:10:16.646 --> 00:10:19.034\nWhy else might people support prohibition?\n\n00:10:19.423 --> 00:10:23.080\nWell, lots of people have\nunderstandable fears about trafficking.\n\n00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:27.469\nFolks think that foreign women\nkidnapped and sold into sexual slavery\n\n00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:30.111\ncan be saved by shutting\na whole industry down.\n\n00:10:30.513 --> 00:10:32.200\nSo let's talk about trafficking.\n\n00:10:33.114 --> 00:10:36.697\nForced labor does occur\nin many industries,\n\n00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:40.300\nespecially those where the workers\nare migrants or otherwise vulnerable,\n\n00:10:40.324 --> 00:10:42.005\nand this needs to be addressed.\n\n00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:46.772\nBut it's best addressed with legislation\ntargeting those specific abuses,\n\n00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:48.312\nnot an entire industry.\n\n00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:51.126\nWhen 23 undocumented Chinese migrants\n\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.067\ndrowned while picking cockles\nin Morecambe Bay in 2004,\n\n00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.027\nthere were no calls to outlaw\nthe entire seafood industry\n\n00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:59.112\nto save trafficking victims.\n\n00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:02.491\nThe solution is clearly to give\nworkers more legal protections,\n\n00:11:02.515 --> 00:11:04.284\nallowing them to resist abuse\n\n00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:07.348\nand report it to authorities\nwithout fear of arrest.\n\n00:11:07.372 --> 00:11:09.672\nThe way the term trafficking\nis thrown around\n\n00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:13.917\nimplies that all undocumented\nmigration into prostitution is forced.\n\n00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:17.387\nIn fact, many migrants\nhave made a decision,\n\n00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:18.665\nout of economic need,\n\n00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:21.472\nto place themselves into the hands\nof people smugglers.\n\n00:11:21.496 --> 00:11:23.278\nMany do this with the full knowledge\n\n00:11:23.302 --> 00:11:26.505\nthat they'll be selling sex\nwhen they reach their destination.\n\n00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:28.282\nAnd yes, it can often be the case\n\n00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:31.551\nthat these people smugglers\ndemand exorbitant fees,\n\n00:11:31.575 --> 00:11:34.479\ncoerce migrants into work\nthey don't want to do\n\n00:11:34.503 --> 00:11:36.390\nand abuse them when they're vulnerable.\n\n00:11:36.414 --> 00:11:37.917\nThat's true of prostitution,\n\n00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:39.888\nbut it's also true of agricultural work,\n\n00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:42.063\nhospitality work and domestic work.\n\n00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:46.004\nUltimately, nobody wants\nto be forced to do any kind of work,\n\n00:11:46.028 --> 00:11:48.529\nbut that's a risk many migrants\nare willing to take,\n\n00:11:48.553 --> 00:11:50.423\nbecause of what they're leaving behind.\n\n00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:52.407\nIf people were allowed to migrate legally\n\n00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:55.968\nthey wouldn't have to place their lives\ninto the hands of people smugglers.\n\n00:11:55.992 --> 00:11:57.143\nThe problems arise\n\n00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:58.992\nfrom the criminalization of migration,\n\n00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:00.977\njust as they do from the criminalization\n\n00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:02.152\nof sex work itself.\n\n00:12:02.176 --> 00:12:03.758\nThis is a lesson of history.\n\n00:12:03.782 --> 00:12:07.428\nIf you try to prohibit something\nthat people want or need to do,\n\n00:12:07.452 --> 00:12:11.027\nwhether that's drinking alcohol\nor crossing borders\n\n00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:12.340\nor getting an abortion\n\n00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:13.724\nor selling sex,\n\n00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:16.329\nyou create more problems than you solve.\n\n00:12:16.353 --> 00:12:18.142\nProhibition barely makes a difference\n\n00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:20.596\nto the amount of people\nactually doing those things.\n\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.101\nBut it makes a huge difference\n\n00:12:22.135 --> 00:12:25.054\nas to whether or not\nthey're safe when they do them.\n\n00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:27.848\nWhy else might people support prohibition?\n\n00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:32.111\nAs a feminist, I know\nthat the sex industry is a site\n\n00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:35.015\nof deeply entrenched social inequality.\n\n00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:38.091\nIt's a fact that most buyers of sex\nare men with money,\n\n00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:40.406\nand most sellers are women without.\n\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.730\nYou can agree with all that -- I do --\n\n00:12:43.349 --> 00:12:46.060\nand still think prohibition\nis a terrible policy.\n\n00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:48.879\nIn a better, more equal world,\n\n00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:52.531\nmaybe there would be far fewer\npeople selling sex to survive,\n\n00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:56.166\nbut you can't simply legislate\na better world into existence.\n\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.676\nIf someone needs to sell sex\nbecause they're poor\n\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.142\nor because they're homeless\n\n00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:03.308\nor because they're undocumented\nand they can't find legal work,\n\n00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:06.887\ntaking away that option\ndoesn't make them any less poor\n\n00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.534\nor house them\n\n00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:10.511\nor change their immigration status.\n\n00:13:10.535 --> 00:13:13.066\nPeople worry that selling\nsex is degrading.\n\n00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:16.271\nAsk yourself: is it more degrading\nthan going hungry\n\n00:13:16.884 --> 00:13:18.811\nor seeing your children go hungry?\n\n00:13:19.324 --> 00:13:22.328\nThere's no call to ban rich people\nfrom hiring nannies\n\n00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:23.605\nor getting manicures,\n\n00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:27.255\neven though most of the people\ndoing that labor are poor, migrant women.\n\n00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:31.423\nIt's the fact of poor migrant women\nselling sex specifically\n\n00:13:31.447 --> 00:13:33.752\nthat has some feminists uncomfortable.\n\n00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:35.592\nAnd I can understand\n\n00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:38.341\nwhy the sex industry provokes\nstrong feelings.\n\n00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:41.388\nPeople have all kinds\nof complicated feelings\n\n00:13:41.412 --> 00:13:42.871\nwhen it comes to sex.\n\n00:13:43.504 --> 00:13:46.749\nBut we can't make policy\non the basis of mere feelings,\n\n00:13:46.773 --> 00:13:48.835\nespecially not over\nthe heads of the people\n\n00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:50.597\nactually effected by those policies.\n\n00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.240\nIf we get fixated on\nthe abolition of sex work,\n\n00:13:53.264 --> 00:13:55.928\nwe end up worrying more\nabout a particular manifestation\n\n00:13:55.952 --> 00:13:57.365\nof gender inequality,\n\n00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:59.711\nrather than about the underlying causes.\n\n00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:02.722\nPeople get really hung up on the question,\n\n00:14:02.746 --> 00:14:05.214\n\"Well, would you want\nyour daughter doing it?\"\n\n00:14:05.238 --> 00:14:06.748\nThat's the wrong question.\n\n00:14:07.175 --> 00:14:09.843\nInstead, imagine she is doing it.\n\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.364\nHow safe is she at work tonight?\n\n00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:14.642\nWhy isn't she safer?\n\n00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:19.376\nSo we've looked at full criminalization,\n\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.403\npartial criminalization,\nthe Swedish or Nordic Model\n\n00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:23.617\nand legalization,\n\n00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:25.293\nand how they all cause harm.\n\n00:14:25.317 --> 00:14:28.269\nSomething I never hear asked is:\n\n00:14:28.797 --> 00:14:30.467\n\"What do sex workers want?\"\n\n00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:34.199\nAfter all, we're the ones\nmost affected by these laws.\n\n00:14:35.073 --> 00:14:37.953\nNew Zealand decriminalized\nsex work in 2003.\n\n00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.391\nIt's crucial to remember\n\n00:14:40.415 --> 00:14:43.866\nthat decriminalization and legalization\nare not the same thing.\n\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.775\nDecriminalization means\nthe removal of laws\n\n00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:48.842\nthat punitively target the sex industry,\n\n00:14:48.866 --> 00:14:52.288\ninstead treating sex work\nmuch like any other kind of work.\n\n00:14:52.312 --> 00:14:55.125\nIn New Zealand, people\ncan work together for safety,\n\n00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:57.902\nand employers of sex workers\nare accountable to the state.\n\n00:14:57.926 --> 00:15:00.609\nA sex worker can refuse\nto see a client at any time,\n\n00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.093\nfor any reason,\n\n00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:04.591\nand 96 percent of street workers\n\n00:15:04.615 --> 00:15:07.756\nreport that they feel the law\nprotects their rights.\n\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.874\nNew Zealand hasn't actually\nseen an increase\n\n00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:12.009\nin the amount of people doing sex work,\n\n00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:14.657\nbut decriminalizing it\nhas made it a lot safer.\n\n00:15:15.232 --> 00:15:16.809\nBut the lesson from New Zealand\n\n00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.230\nisn't just that its particular\nlegislation is good,\n\n00:15:19.254 --> 00:15:20.405\nbut that crucially,\n\n00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:22.748\nit was written in collaboration\nwith sex workers;\n\n00:15:22.772 --> 00:15:25.081\nnamely, the New Zealand\nProstitutes' Collective.\n\n00:15:25.105 --> 00:15:27.434\nWhen it came to making sex work safer,\n\n00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:30.647\nthey were ready to hear it straight\nfrom sex workers themselves.\n\n00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:32.359\nHere in the UK,\n\n00:15:32.383 --> 00:15:35.801\nI'm part of sex worker-led groups\nlike the Sex Worker Open University\n\n00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:37.920\nand the English Collective of Prostitutes.\n\n00:15:37.944 --> 00:15:39.739\nAnd we form part of a global movement\n\n00:15:39.763 --> 00:15:43.223\ndemanding decriminalization\nand self-determination.\n\n00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:46.351\nThe universal symbol of our movement\nis the red umbrella.\n\n00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:49.476\nWe're supported in our demands\nby global bodies like UNAIDS,\n\n00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.100\nthe World Health Organization\n\n00:15:51.124 --> 00:15:52.510\nand Amnesty International.\n\n00:15:52.882 --> 00:15:54.720\nBut we need more allies.\n\n00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:57.475\nIf you care about gender equality\n\n00:15:57.499 --> 00:16:00.295\nor poverty or migration or public health,\n\n00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:02.823\nthen sex worker rights matter to you.\n\n00:16:03.313 --> 00:16:05.336\nMake space for us in your movements.\n\n00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.596\nThat means not only listening\nto sex workers when we speak\n\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.621\nbut amplifying our voices.\n\n00:16:11.177 --> 00:16:13.298\nResist those who silence us,\n\n00:16:13.322 --> 00:16:16.501\nthose who say that a prostitute\nis either too victimized,\n\n00:16:16.525 --> 00:16:19.171\ntoo damaged to know\nwhat's best for herself,\n\n00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:20.931\nor else too privileged\n\n00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:23.143\nand too removed from real hardship,\n\n00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:26.547\nnot representative of the millions\nof voiceless victims.\n\n00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:32.470\nThis distinction between victim\nand empowered is imaginary.\n\n00:16:32.494 --> 00:16:34.947\nIt exists purely to discredit sex workers\n\n00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:36.914\nand make it easy to ignore us.\n\n00:16:37.777 --> 00:16:39.969\nNo doubt many of you work for a living.\n\n00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:42.239\nWell, sex work is work, too.\n\n00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:43.991\nJust like you,\n\n00:16:44.015 --> 00:16:45.621\nsome of us like our jobs,\n\n00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:47.046\nsome of us hate them.\n\n00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:50.371\nUltimately, most of us\nhave mixed feelings.\n\n00:16:51.196 --> 00:16:53.602\nBut how we feel about our work\n\n00:16:54.524 --> 00:16:55.698\nisn't the point.\n\n00:16:56.442 --> 00:16:59.460\nAnd how others feel\nabout our work certainly isn't.\n\n00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:03.079\nWhat's important is that we have\nthe right to work safely\n\n00:17:03.103 --> 00:17:04.411\nand on our own terms.\n\n00:17:04.435 --> 00:17:06.310\nSex workers are real people.\n\n00:17:06.781 --> 00:17:08.961\nWe've had complicated experiences\n\n00:17:09.613 --> 00:17:12.668\nand complicated responses\nto those experiences.\n\n00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.385\nBut our demands are not complicated.\n\n00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:19.206\nYou can ask expensive\nescorts in New York City,\n\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.168\nbrothel workers in Cambodia,\nstreet workers in South Africa\n\n00:17:22.192 --> 00:17:25.311\nand every girl on the roster\nat my old job in Soho,\n\n00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:27.675\nand they will all tell you the same thing.\n\n00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:29.940\nYou can speak to millions of sex workers\n\n00:17:29.964 --> 00:17:32.421\nand countless sex work-led organizations.\n\n00:17:32.445 --> 00:17:36.415\nWe want full decriminalization\nand labor rights as workers.\n\n00:17:36.943 --> 00:17:39.259\nI'm just one sex worker\non the stage today,\n\n00:17:39.283 --> 00:17:41.853\nbut I'm bringing a message\nfrom all over the world.\n\n00:17:41.877 --> 00:17:43.045\nThank you.\n\n00:17:43.069 --> 00:17:49.442\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How free is our freedom of the press?", "duration": "313", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/trevor_timm_how_free_is_our_freedom_of_the_press", "transcript": "So this is James Risen. You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times. Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name, Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans. But it's another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact. In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran. If that sounds crazy, go read it. It's an incredible story.But you know who didn't like that chapter? The US government. For nearly a decade afterwards, Risen was the subject of a US government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources. And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.You see, under the First Amendment, the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest. But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them. So when the government came knocking, Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him: he refused and said he'd rather go to jail. So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened. Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case, the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether. It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance, there are very few places reporters and sources can hide. And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify, they could have his digital trail testify against him instead. So completely in secret and without his consent, prosecutors got Risen's phone records. They got his email records, his financial and banking information, his credit reports, even travel records with a list of flights he had taken. And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.Sadly, this is only one case of many. President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers, and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined. Now, you can see how this could be a problem, especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret. Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist. So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters' rights, the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before. And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them, rather than on the witness stand after the fact. Communications software now exists that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book, and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls. For example, one such tool is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower submission system that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz, and is now developed at the non-profit where I work, Freedom of the Press Foundation. Instead of sending an email, you go to a news organization's website, like this one here on The Washington Post. From there, you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form. It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the news organization has access to. So the government can no longer secretly demand the information, and much of the information they would demand wouldn't be available in the first place.SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century. Unfortunately, governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk. And it's up to us going forward to make sure that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers, like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing. It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower alerting us to overcrowded hospitals, or the next environmental worker sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water, or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis. After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes, but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2507,

of being a misfit", "duration": "778", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lidia_yuknavitch_the_beauty_of_being_a_misfit", "transcript": "So I know TED is about a lot of things that are big, but I want to talk to you about something very small. So small, it's a single word. The word is \"misfit.\" It's one of my favorite words, because it's so literal. I mean, it's a person who sort of missed fitting in. Or a person who fits in badly. Or this: \"a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments.\" I'm a card-carrying misfit. And I'm here for the other misfits in the room, because I'm never the only one. I'm going to tell you a misfit story.Somewhere in my early 30s, the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep. Actually, it came to my mailbox in the form of a letter that said I'd won a giant literary prize for a short story I had written. The short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer and about my crappy home life, and a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane. The prize was a trip to New York City to meet big-time editors and agents and other authors. So kind of it was the wannabe writer's dream, right? You know what I did the day the letter came to my house? Because I'm me, I put the letter on my kitchen table, I poured myself a giant glass of vodka with ice and lime, and I sat there in my underwear for an entire day, just staring at the letter. I was thinking about all the ways I'd already screwed my life up. Who the hell was I to go to New York City and pretend to be a writer? Who was I?I'll tell you. I was a misfit. Like legions of other children, I came from an abusive household that I narrowly escaped with my life. I already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt. I'd flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that I'm not going to tell you about.(Laughter)And I'd done an episode of rehab for drug use. And I'd had two lovely staycations in jail. So I'm on the right stage.(Laughter)But the real reason, I think, I was a misfit, is that my daughter died the day she was born, and I hadn't figured out how to live with that story yet. After my daughter died I also spent a long time homeless, living under an overpass in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way. Maybe all of us, if you live long enough. You know, homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits, because they start out as us. So you see, I'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there: daughter, wife, mother, scholar. And the dream of being a writer was really kind of like a small, sad stone in my throat.It was pretty much in spite of myself that I got on that plane and flew to New York City, where the writers are. Fellow misfits, I can almost see your heads glowing. I can pick you out of a room. At first, you would've loved it. You got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet, and these guys went and found them for you. You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel, where you got to drink Scotch late in the night with cool, smart, swank people. And you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank, too. And you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents at very, very fancy lunches and dinners. Ask me how fancy.Audience: How fancy?Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession: I stole three linen napkins \u2014(Laughter)from three different restaurants. And I shoved a menu down my pants.(Laughter)I just wanted some keepsakes so that when I got home, I could believe it had really happened to me. You know?The three writers I wanted to meet were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman and Peggy Phelan. These were not famous, best-selling authors, but to me, they were women-writer titans. Carole Maso wrote the book that later became my art bible. Lynne Tillman gave me permission to believe that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world. And Peggy Phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs. They weren't mainstream women writers, but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories, I like to think, kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon.It nearly killed me with joy to hang out with these three over-50-year-old women writers. And the reason it nearly killed me with joy is that I'd never known a joy like that. I'd never been in a room like that. My mother never went to college. And my creative career to that point was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing. So kind of in those first nights in New York I wanted to die there. I was just like, \"Kill me now. I'm good. This is beautiful.\" Some of you in the room will understand what happened next.First, they took me to the offices of Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Farrar, Straus and Giroux was like my mega-dream press. I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor were published there. The main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time, trying to convince me I had a book in me about my life as a swimmer. You know, like a memoir. The whole time he was talking to me, I sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot, with my arms crossed over my chest, while nothing, nothing, nothing came out of my throat. So in the end, he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might. And he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door.Next, they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton, where I was pretty sure I'd be escorted from the building just for wearing Doc Martens. But that didn't happen. Being at the Norton offices felt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon while the stars stitched your name across the cosmos. I mean, that's how big a deal it was to me. You get it? Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith, leaned over right in my face with these beady, bright, fierce eyes and said, \"Well, send me something then, immediately!\" See, now most people, especially TED people, would have run to the mailbox, right? It took me over a decade to even imagine putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp.On the last night, I gave a big reading at the National Poetry Club. And at the end of the reading, Katharine Kidde of Kidde, Hoyt & Picard Literary Agency, walked straight up to me and shook my hand and offered me representation, like, on the spot. I stood there and I kind of went deaf. Has this ever happened to you? And I almost started crying because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully, and all that came out of my mouth was: \"I don't know. I have to think about it.\" And she said, \"OK, then,\" and walked away. All those open hands out to me, that small, sad stone in my throat ...You see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me. Misfit people \u2014 we don't always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing, even when it's right in front of us. It's a shame we carry. It's the shame of wanting something good. It's the shame of feeling something good. It's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room with the people we admire.If I could, I'd go back and I'd coach myself. I'd be exactly like those over-50-year-old women who helped me. I'd teach myself how to want things, how to stand up, how to ask for them. I'd say, \"You! Yeah, you! You belong in the room, too.\" The radiance falls on all of us, and we are nothing without each other. Instead, I flew back to Oregon, and as I watched the evergreens and rain come back into view, I just drank many tiny bottles of airplane \"feel sorry for yourself.\" I thought about how, if I was a writer, I was some kind of misfit writer. What I'm saying is, I flew back to Oregon without a book deal, without an agent, and with only a headful and heart-ful of memories of having sat so near the beautiful writers. Memory was the only prize I allowed myself.And yet, at home in the dark, back in my underwear, I could still hear their voices. They said, \"Don't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up or change your story.\" They said, \"Give voice to the story only you know how to tell.\" They said, \"Sometimes telling the story is the thing that saves your life.\"Now I am, as you can see, the woman over 50. And I'm a writer. And I'm a mother. And I became a teacher. Guess who my favorite students are. Although it didn't happen the day that dream letter came through my mailbox, I did write a memoir, called \"The Chronology of Water.\" In it are the stories of how many times I've had to reinvent a self from the ruins of my choices, the stories of how my seeming failures were really just weird-ass portals to something beautiful. All I had to do was give voice to the story.There's a myth in most cultures about following your dreams. It's called the hero's journey. But I prefer a different myth, that's slightly to the side of that or underneath it. It's called the misfit's myth. And it goes like this: even at the moment of your failure, right then, you are beautiful. You don't know it yet, but you have the ability to reinvent yourself endlessly. That's your beauty.You can be a drunk, you can be a survivor of abuse, you can be an ex-con, you can be a homeless person, you can lose all your money or your job or your husband or your wife, or the worst thing of all, a child. You can even lose your marbles. You can be standing dead center in the middle of your failure and still, I'm only here to tell you, you are so beautiful. Your story deserves to be heard, because you, you rare and phenomenal misfit, you new species, are the only one in the room who can tell the story the way only you would. And I'd be listening.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2508, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.530\nSo I know TED is about a lot\nof things

00:10:00.361\nWhat I'm saying is,\n\n00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:02.389\nI flew back to Oregon without a book deal,\n\n00:10:02.413 --> 00:10:03.564\nwithout an agent,\n\n00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:06.073\nand

"https://www.ted.com/talks/mariano_sigman_your_words_may_predict_your_future_mental_health", "transcript": "We have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... but how did they think?One natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought \u2014 our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream \u2014 have always been the same. Another possibility is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture may have also changed the structural columns of human thought.We may all have different opinions about this. Actually, it's a long-standing philosophical debate. But is this question even amenable to science?Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture are the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought.And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient books of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today we would call schizophrenics. And he made this claim based on the fact that the first humans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions and in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived as coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... what today we would call hallucinations. And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize that they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices. And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think about their own thoughts.So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence \u2014 is a quite recent cultural development. And this theory is quite spectacular, but it has an obvious problem which is that it's built on just a few and very specific examples. So the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner.And the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious. It's not like Plato woke up one day and then he wrote, \"Hello, I'm Plato, and as of today, I have a fully introspective consciousness.\"(Laughter)And this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem. We need to find the emergence of a concept that's never said. The word introspection does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze.So our way to solve this is to build the space of words. This is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them is indicative of how closely related they are. So for instance, you want the words \"dog\" and \"cat\" to be very close together, but the words \"grapefruit\" and \"logarithm\" to be very far away. And this has to be true for any two words within the space.And there are different ways that we can construct the space of words. One is just asking the experts, a bit like we do with dictionaries. Another possibility is following the simple assumption that when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, in the same paragraphs, in the same documents, more often than would be expected just by pure chance. And this simple hypothesis, this simple method, with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex and high-dimensional space, turns out to be quite effective.And just to give you a flavor of how well this works, this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words. And you can see first that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods. So you get the fruits, the body parts, the computer parts, the scientific terms and so on.The algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy. So for instance, you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms. And then there are very fine things. For instance, the word astronomy, which seems a bit bizarre where it is, is actually exactly where it should be, between what it is, an actual science, and between what it describes, the astronomical terms.And we could go on and on with this. Actually, if you stare at this for a while, and you just build random trajectories, you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry. And this is because, in a way, walking in this space is like walking in the mind.And the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions, of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection. So for instance, words such as \"self,\" \"guilt,\" \"reason,\" \"emotion,\" are very close to \"introspection,\" but other words, such as \"red,\" \"football,\" \"candle,\" \"banana,\" are just very far away.And so once we've built the space, the question of the history of introspection, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract and somehow vague, becomes concrete \u2014 becomes amenable to quantitative science.All that we have to do is take the books, we digitize them, and we take this stream of words as a trajectory and project them into the space, and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time circling closely to the concept of introspection.And with this, we could analyze the history of introspection in the ancient Greek tradition, for which we have the best available written record. So what we did is we took all the books \u2014 we just ordered them by time \u2014 for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection, and we just average that. And then we ask whether, as time goes on and on, these books get closer, and closer and closer to the concept of introspection.And this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition. So you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection. But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer, and closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different, independent tradition.So we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern. Again, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament. And then we get the peak of introspection in \"The Confessions of Saint Augustine,\" about four centuries after Christ. And this was very important, because Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection. Actually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology.So our algorithm, which has the virtue of being quantitative, of being objective, and of course of being extremely fast \u2014 it just runs in a fraction of a second \u2014 can capture some of the most important conclusions of this long tradition of investigation. And this is in a way one of the beauties of science, which is that now this idea can be translated and generalized to a whole lot of different domains.So in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness. To put it more precisely, whether the words we say today can tell us something of where our minds will be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from now.And in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate, our respiration, our genes, on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases, we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak, we tweet, we email, we write, can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong with our minds. And with Guillermo Cecchi, who has been my brother in this adventure, we took on this task. And we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia.And so what we did is, we measured speech at day one, and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psychosis. But despite our hopes, we got failure after failure. There was just not enough information in semantics to predict the future organization of the mind. It was good enough to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group, a bit like we had done for the ancient texts, but not to predict the future onset of psychosis.But then we realized that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying, but how they were saying it. More specifically, it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were, but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood to the other one. And so we came up with this measure, which we termed semantic coherence, which essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic, within one semantic category.And it turned out to be that for this group of 34 people, the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict, with 100 percent accuracy, who developed psychosis and who will not. And this was something that could not be achieved \u2014 not even close \u2014 with all the other existing clinical measures.And I remember vividly, while I was working on this, I was sitting at my computer and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo \u2014 Polo had been my first student back in Buenos Aires, and at the time he was living in New York. And there was something in this tweets \u2014 I could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly \u2014 but I got this strong hunch, this strong intuition, that something was going wrong. So I picked up the phone, and I called Polo, and in fact he was not feeling well. And this simple fact, that reading in between the lines, I could sense, through words, his feelings, was a simple, but very effective way to help.What I tell you today is that we're getting close to understanding how we can convert this intuition that we all have, that we all share, into an algorithm. And in doing so, we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health, based on objective, quantitative and automated analysis of the words we write, of the words we say.Gracias.(Applause)", "id": 2510, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:18.114\nWe have historical records that allow us\nto know how the

00:00:31.147\nto be conscious,\n\n00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:32.402\nto dream --\n\n00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:34.045\nhave always been the same.\n\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.329\nAnother possibility\n\n00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:40.076\nis that the social transformations\nthat have shaped our culture\n\n00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.885\nmay have also changed\nthe structural columns of human thought.\n\n00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.393\nWe may all have different\nopinions about this.\n\n00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.134\nActually, it's a long-standing\nphilosophical debate.\n\n00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:53.329\nBut is this question\neven amenable to science?\n\n00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:57.298\nHere I'd like to propose\n\n00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:02.094\nthat in the same way we can reconstruct\nhow the ancient Greek cities looked\n\n00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:04.506\njust based on a few bricks,\n\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.656\nthat the writings of a culture\nare the archaeological records,\n\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.823\nthe fossils, of human thought.\n\n00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.037\nAnd in fact,\n\n00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:15.267\ndoing some form of psychological analysis\n\n00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:18.835\nof some of the most ancient\nbooks of human culture,\n\n00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:24.814\nJulian Jaynes came up in the '70s\nwith a very wild and radical hypothesis:\n\n00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.251\nthat only 3,000 years ago,\n\n00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:32.163\nhumans were what today\nwe would call schizophrenics.\n\n00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:35.219\nAnd he made this claim\n\n00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:38.544\nbased on the fact that the first\nhumans described in these books\n\n00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:40.472\nbehaved consistently,\n\n00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.512\nin different traditions\nand in different places of the world,\n\n00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:47.068\nas if they were hearing and obeying voices\n\n00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:50.132\nthat they perceived\nas coming from the Gods,\n\n00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:51.354\nor from the muses ...\n\n00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.790\nwhat today we would call hallucinations.\n\n00:01:55.846 --> 00:01:58.472\nAnd only then, as time went on,\n\n00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:02.147\nthey began to recognize\nthat they were the creators,\n\n00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:04.686\nthe owners of these inner voices.\n\n00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:07.989\nAnd with this, they gained introspection:\n\n00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:10.496\nthe ability to think\nabout their own thoughts.\n\n00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:15.140\nSo Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,\n\n00:02:15.164 --> 00:02:18.330\nat least in the way we perceive it today,\n\n00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:21.894\nwhere we feel that we are the pilots\nof our own existence --\n\n00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:24.655\nis a quite recent cultural development.\n\n00:02:25.414 --> 00:02:27.200\nAnd this theory is quite spectacular,\n\n00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:28.657\nbut it has an obvious problem\n\n00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.673\nwhich is that it's built on just a few\nand very specific examples.\n\n00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:34.806\nSo the question is whether the theory\n\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.581\nthat introspection built up in human\nhistory only about 3,000 years ago\n\n00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:42.589\ncan be examined in a quantitative\nand objective manner.\n\n00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:47.064\nAnd the problem of how\nto go about this is quite obvious.\n\n00:02:47.088 --> 00:02:50.548\nIt's not like Plato woke up one day\nand then he wrote,\n\n00:02:50.572 --> 00:02:52.231\n\"Hello, I'm Plato,\n\n00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.144\nand as of today, I have\na fully introspective consciousness.\"\n\n00:02:55.168 --> 00:02:57.461\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.818\nAnd this tells us actually\nwhat is the essence of the problem.\n\n00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:05.480\nWe need to find the emergence\nof a concept that's never said.\n\n00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:10.702\nThe word introspection\ndoes not appear a single time\n\n00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:12.645\nin the books we want to analyze.\n\n00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:17.773\nSo our way to solve this\nis to build the space of words.\n\n00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.816\nThis is a huge space\nthat contains all words\n\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.642\nin such a way that the distance\nbetween any two of them\n\n00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:27.549\nis indicative of how\nclosely related they are.\n\n00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:29.569\nSo for instance,\n\n00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:32.490\nyou want the words \"dog\" and \"cat\"\nto be very close together,\n\n00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:36.345\nbut the words \"grapefruit\" and \"logarithm\"\nto be very far away.\n\n00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:40.663\nAnd this has to be true\nfor any two words within the space.\n\n00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:44.925\nAnd there are different ways\nthat we can construct the space of words.\n\n00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.592\nOne is just asking the experts,\n\n00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:48.512\na bit like we do with dictionaries.\n\n00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.282\nAnother possibility\n\n00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:54.021\nis following the simple assumption\nthat when two words are related,\n\n00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:56.394\nthey tend to appear in the same sentences,\n\n00:03:56.418 --> 00:03:57.871\nin the same paragraphs,\n\n00:03:57.895 --> 00:03:59.665\nin the same documents,\n\n00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.871\nmore often than would be expected\njust by pure chance.\n\n00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.239\nAnd this simple hypothesis,\n\n00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:07.569\nthis simple method,\n\n00:04:07.593 --> 00:04:09.200\nwith some computational tricks\n\n00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:10.613\nthat have to do with the fact\n\n00:04:10.637 --> 00:04:13.701\nthat this is a very complex\nand high-dimensional space,\n\n00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:15.390\nturns out to be quite effective.\n\n00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:18.915\nAnd just to give you a flavor\nof how well this works,\n\n00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.851\nthis is the result we get when\nwe analyze this for some familiar words.\n\n00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:24.750\nAnd you can see first\n\n00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:28.052\nthat words automatically organize\ninto semantic neighborhoods.\n\n00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:30.293\nSo you get the fruits, the body parts,\n\n00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:32.742\nthe computer parts,\nthe scientific terms and so on.\n\n00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:37.299\nThe algorithm also identifies\nthat we organize concepts in a hierarchy.\n\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.961\nSo for instance,\n\n00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:42.582\nyou can see that the scientific terms\nbreak down into two subcategories\n\n00:04:42.606 --> 00:04:44.706\nof the astronomic and the physics terms.\n\n00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:47.542\nAnd then there are very fine things.\n\n00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:49.471\nFor instance, the word astronomy,\n\n00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:51.310\nwhich seems a bit bizarre where it is,\n\n00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:53.382\nis actually exactly where it should be,\n\n00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:55.001\nbetween what it is,\n\n00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:56.295\nan actual science,\n\n00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.855\nand between what it describes,\n\n00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.371\nthe astronomical terms.\n\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.031\nAnd we could go on and on with this.\n\n00:05:02.055 --> 00:05:04.115\nActually, if you stare\nat this for a while,\n\n00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.997\nand you just build random trajectories,\n\n00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:09.187\nyou will see that it actually feels\na bit like doing poetry.\n\n00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.858\nAnd this is because, in a way,\n\n00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:14.822\nwalking in this space\nis like walking in the mind.\n\n00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:17.602\nAnd the last thing\n\n00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:21.666\nis that this algorithm also identifies\nwhat are our intuitions,\n\n00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.586\nof which words should lead\nin the neighborhood of introspection.\n\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.833\nSo for instance,\n\n00:05:26.857 --> 00:05:30.836\nwords such as \"self,\" \"guilt,\"\n\"reason,\" \"emotion,\"\n\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.749\nare very close to \"introspection,\"\n\n00:05:32.773 --> 00:05:33.924\nbut other words,\n\n00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:36.115\nsuch as \"red,\" \"football,\"\n\"candle,\" \"banana,\"\n\n00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.591\nare just very far away.\n\n00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:40.774\nAnd so once we've built the space,\n\n00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:43.624\nthe question of the history\nof introspection,\n\n00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:45.981\nor of the history of any concept\n\n00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:50.784\nwhich before could seem abstract\nand somehow vague,\n\n00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:52.412\nbecomes concrete --\n\n00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:55.174\nbecomes amenable to quantitative science.\n\n00:05:56.174 --> 00:05:58.936\nAll that we have to do is take the books,\n\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.341\nwe digitize them,\n\n00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:03.174\nand we take this stream\nof words as a trajectory\n\n00:06:03.198 --> 00:06:05.167\nand project them into the space,\n\n00:06:05.191 --> 00:06:08.945\nand then we ask whether this trajectory\nspends significant time\n\n00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.961\ncircling closely to the concept\nof introspection.\n\n00:06:12.718 --> 00:06:13.914\nAnd with this,\n\n00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:16.050\nwe could analyze\nthe history of introspection\n\n00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:17.995\nin the ancient Greek tradition,\n\n00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:20.621\nfor which we have the best\navailable written record.\n\n00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.844\nSo what we did is we took all the books --\n\n00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:26.152\nwe just ordered them by time --\n\n00:06:26.176 --> 00:06:27.928\nfor each book we take the words\n\n00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:29.913\nand we project them to the space,\n\n00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:32.969\nand then we ask for each word\nhow close it is to introspection,\n\n00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.223\nand we just average that.\n\n00:06:34.548 --> 00:06:37.746\nAnd then we ask whether,\nas time goes on and on,\n\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.022\nthese books get closer,\nand closer and closer\n\n00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:42.800\nto the concept of introspection.\n\n00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:46.625\nAnd this is exactly what happens\nin the ancient Greek tradition.\n\n00:06:47.656 --> 00:06:50.783\nSo you can see that for the oldest books\nin the Homeric tradition,\n\n00:06:50.807 --> 00:06:54.219\nthere is a small increase with books\ngetting closer to introspection.\n\n00:06:54.243 --> 00:06:56.449\nBut about four centuries before Christ,\n\n00:06:56.473 --> 00:07:01.181\nthis starts ramping up very rapidly\nto an almost five-fold increase\n\n00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:03.705\nof books getting closer,\nand closer and closer\n\n00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.411\nto the concept of introspection.\n\n00:07:06.117 --> 00:07:08.541\nAnd one of the nice things about this\n\n00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:09.763\nis that now we can ask\n\n00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:13.934\nwhether this is also true\nin a different, independent tradition.\n\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.096\nSo we just ran this same analysis\non the Judeo-Christian tradition,\n\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.841\nand we got virtually the same pattern.\n\n00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:26.141\nAgain, you see a small increase\nfor the oldest books in the Old Testament,\n\n00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:28.079\nand then it increases much more rapidly\n\n00:07:28.103 --> 00:07:29.942\nin the new books of the New Testament.\n\n00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:31.998\nAnd then we get the peak of introspection\n\n00:07:32.022 --> 00:07:34.149\nin \"The Confessions of Saint Augustine,\"\n\n00:07:34.173 --> 00:07:36.030\nabout four centuries after Christ.\n\n00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:38.799\nAnd this was very important,\n\n00:07:38.823 --> 00:07:42.196\nbecause Saint Augustine\nhad been recognized by scholars,\n\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.392\nphilologists, historians,\n\n00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:46.494\nas one of the founders of introspection.\n\n00:07:47.018 --> 00:07:50.315\nActually, some believe him to be\nthe father of modern psychology.\n\n00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.809\nSo our algorithm,\n\n00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:55.675\nwhich has the virtue\nof being quantitative,\n\n00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:56.962\nof being objective,\n\n00:07:56.986 --> 00:07:59.002\nand of course of being extremely fast --\n\n00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:01.423\nit just runs in a fraction of a second --\n\n00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:04.950\ncan capture some of the most\nimportant conclusions\n\n00:08:04.974 --> 00:08:07.196\nof this long tradition of investigation.\n\n00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:11.926\nAnd this is in a way\none of the beauties of science,\n\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.426\nwhich is that now this idea\ncan be translated\n\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.021\nand generalized to a whole lot\nof different domains.\n\n00:08:18.727 --> 00:08:23.494\nSo in the same way that we asked\nabout the past of human consciousness,\n\n00:08:23.518 --> 00:08:26.924\nmaybe the most challenging question\nwe can pose to ourselves\n\n00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:31.085\nis whether this can tell us something\nabout the future of our own consciousness.\n\n00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:32.978\nTo put it more precisely,\n\n00:08:33.002 --> 00:08:35.418\nwhether the words we say today\n\n00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:40.639\ncan tell us something\nof where our minds will be in a few days,\n\n00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:41.814\nin a few months\n\n00:08:41.838 --> 00:08:43.020\nor a few years from now.\n\n00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:46.575\nAnd in the same way many of us\nare now wearing sensors\n\n00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:48.385\nthat detect our heart rate,\n\n00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:49.678\nour respiration,\n\n00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:51.369\nour genes,\n\n00:08:51.393 --> 00:08:55.044\non the hopes that this may\nhelp us prevent diseases,\n\n00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:58.589\nwe can ask whether monitoring\nand analyzing the words we speak,\n\n00:08:58.613 --> 00:09:01.296\nwe tweet, we email, we write,\n\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.128\ncan tell us ahead of time whether\nsomething may go wrong with our minds.\n\n00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:08.579\nAnd with Guillermo Cecchi,\n\n00:09:08.603 --> 00:09:11.604\nwho has been my brother in this adventure,\n\n00:09:11.628 --> 00:09:13.183\nwe took on this task.\n\n00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:19.718\nAnd we did so by analyzing\nthe recorded speech of 34 young people\n\n00:09:19.742 --> 00:09:22.543\nwho were at a high risk\nof developing schizophrenia.\n\n00:09:23.392 --> 00:09:26.273\nAnd so what we did is,\nwe measured speech at day one,\n\n00:09:26.297 --> 00:09:29.539\nand then we asked whether the properties\nof the speech could predict,\n\n00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:32.059\nwithin a window of almost three years,\n\n00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:34.118\nthe future development of psychosis.\n\n00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:37.751\nBut despite our hopes,\n\n00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:40.892\nwe got failure after failure.\n\n00:09:41.751 --> 00:09:45.633\nThere was just not enough\ninformation in semantics\n\n00:09:45.657 --> 00:09:48.450\nto predict the future\norganization of the mind.\n\n00:09:48.474 --> 00:09:50.283\nIt was good enough\n\n00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:54.482\nto distinguish between a group\nof schizophrenics and a control group,\n\n00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:57.218\na bit like we had done\nfor the ancient texts,\n\n00:09:57.242 --> 00:10:00.236\nbut not to predict the future\nonset of psychosis.\n\n00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:02.828\nBut then we realized\n\n00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.940\nthat maybe the most important thing\nwas not so much what they were saying,\n\n00:10:06.964 --> 00:10:08.637\nbut how they were saying it.\n\n00:10:09.637 --> 00:10:10.857\nMore specifically,\n\n00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:13.708\nit was not in which semantic\nneighborhoods the words were,\n\n00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:16.332\nbut how far and fast they jumped\n\n00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:18.657\nfrom one semantic neighborhood\nto the other one.\n\n00:10:19.205 --> 00:10:20.936\nAnd so we came up with this measure,\n\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.349\nwhich we termed semantic coherence,\n\n00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:28.177\nwhich essentially measures the persistence\nof speech within one semantic topic,\n\n00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.730\nwithin one semantic category.\n\n00:10:31.252 --> 00:10:35.299\nAnd it turned out to be\nthat for this group of 34 people,\n\n00:10:35.323 --> 00:10:38.982\nthe algorithm based on semantic\ncoherence could predict,\n\n00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:41.506\nwith 100 percent accuracy,\n\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.037\nwho developed psychosis and who will not.\n\n00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:47.871\nAnd this was something\nthat could not be achieved --\n\n00:10:47.895 --> 00:10:49.403\nnot even close --\n\n00:10:49.427 --> 00:10:52.553\nwith all the other\nexisting clinical measures.\n\n00:10:54.483 --> 00:10:58.062\nAnd I remember vividly,\nwhile I was working on this,\n\n00:10:58.086 --> 00:11:00.403\nI was sitting at my computer\n\n00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:03.062\nand I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo --\n\n00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:06.253\nPolo had been my first student\nback in Buenos Aires,\n\n00:11:06.277 --> 00:11:08.347\nand at the time\nhe was living in New York.\n\n00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:10.459\nAnd there was something in this tweets --\n\n00:11:10.483 --> 00:11:13.984\nI could not tell exactly what\nbecause nothing was said explicitly --\n\n00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:16.029\nbut I got this strong hunch,\n\n00:11:16.053 --> 00:11:19.008\nthis strong intuition,\nthat something was going wrong.\n\n00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:23.028\nSo I picked up the phone,\nand I called Polo,\n\n00:11:23.052 --> 00:11:24.971\nand in fact he was not feeling well.\n\n00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.257\nAnd this simple fact,\n\n00:11:27.281 --> 00:11:29.772\nthat reading in between the lines,\n\n00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:34.058\nI could sense,\nthrough words, his feelings,\n\n00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:36.701\nwas a simple, but very\neffective way to help.\n\n00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:39.583\nWhat I tell you today\n\n00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:42.115\nis that we're getting\nclose to understanding\n\n00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:46.425\nhow we can convert this intuition\nthat we all have,\n\n00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:47.814\nthat we all share,\n\n00:11:47.838 --> 00:11:49.035\ninto an algorithm.\n\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.521\nAnd in doing so,\n\n00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:56.195\nwe may be seeing in the future\na very different form of mental health,\n\n00:11:56.219 --> 00:12:01.840\nbased on objective, quantitative\nand automated

I've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt, and south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas. Most recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet.My drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence and tranquility in the landscape, allowing viewers to emotionally connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit. I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation. If you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes, perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them.Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else. And studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report. Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020. And sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by century's end. I have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium, one that moves us in a way that statistics may not.My process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change. On-site, I take thousands of photographs. Back in the studio, I work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs to create very large-scale compositions, sometimes over 10 feet wide.I draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors. I consider my work drawings but others call them painting. I cringe, though, when I'm referred to as a \"finger painter.\"(Laughter)But I don't use any tools and I have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper. Drawing is a form of meditation for me. It quiets my mind. I don't perceive what I'm drawing as ice or water. Instead, the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape. Once the piece is complete, I can finally experience the composition as a whole, as an iceberg floating through glassy water, or a wave cresting with foam. On average, a piece this size takes me about, as you can see, 10 seconds.(Laughter)(Applause)Really, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size. But I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really. My mom was an artist, and growing up, we always had art supplies all over the house. My mother's love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth, and my family and I were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures. We rode camels in Northern Africa and mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole.In August of 2012, I led my first expedition, taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland. My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip. She and I were in the early stages of planning, as we had intended to go together, when she fell victim to a brain tumor. The cancer quickly took over her body and mind, and she passed away six months later. During the months of her illness, though, her dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise to carry out her final journey.My mother's passion for the Arctic echoed through my experience in Greenland, and I felt the power and the fragility of the landscape. The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling. The ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that I never expected. I expanded the scale of my compositions to give you that same sense of awe that I experienced. Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident, so, too, is its vulnerability. From our boat, I could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun.We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland that now face huge challenges. The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did. And without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds are severely diminished, threatening their way of life and survival.The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels, which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest-lying islands. One year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives, the lowest and flattest country in the entire world. While I was there, I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work: drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century.Devastating events happen every day on scales both global and personal. When I was in Greenland, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice. Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much, even as it, too, passes and takes on new form.Among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive, rather than the negative. My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose. I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux, documenting the transition and inspiring our global community to take action for the future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2511,

Most of you see a barbershop, but I see an opportunity: an opportunity for health, an opportunity for health equity.For black men, the barbershop is not just a place where you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed. No, it's much more than that. Historically, the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men. It's a place where we go for friendship, solidarity and solace. It's a place where we go to get away from the stress of the grind of work and sometimes home life. It's a place where we don't have to worry about how we're being perceived by the outside world. It's a place where we don't feel threatened, or threatening. It's a place of loyalty and trust. For that reason, it's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves and just ... talk. The talk, the shop talk, the conversation, that is the essence of the black barbershop.I can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid. We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop every other Saturday. And like clockwork, the same group of men would be there every time we went, either waiting on their favorite barber or just soaking up the atmosphere.I can remember the jovial greeting that warmly welcomed us every time we went.\"Hey Rev,\" they would say to my dad. He's a local pastor, and they treated him like a celebrity.\"Hey young fella, how you doing?\" they would say to me, making me feel just as special.I remember the range of the conversations was immense. The men would talk about politics and sports and music and world news, national news, neighborhood news. There was some talk about women and what it was like to be a black man in America. But many times they also talked about health. The conversations about health were lengthy and deep. The men often recounted their doctor's recommendations to cut salt in their diet or to eat less fried foods or to stop smoking or to reduce stress. They talked about the different ways you could reduce stress, like simplifying one's love life \u2014(Laughter)all ways to treat high blood pressure.There's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop. That's because almost 40 percent of black men have it. That means that almost every single black man either has high blood pressure or knows a black man who has it.Sometimes, those conversations in the barbershop would be about what happens when high blood pressure is not adequately addressed.\"Say, did you hear about Jimmy? He had a stroke.\"\"Did you hear about Eddie? He died last week. Massive heart attack. He was 50.\"More black men die from high blood pressure than from anything else, even though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated that death from high blood pressure can be prevented with timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.So why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men? Because too often, high blood pressure is either untreated or under-treated in black men, in part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system. Black men, in particular those with high blood pressure, are less likely to have a primary care doctor than other groups.But why? Some of our earliest research on black men's health revealed that for many, the doctor's office is associated with fear, mistrust, disrespect, and unnecessary unpleasantness. The doctor's office is only a place that you go when you don't feel well. And when you do go, you might wait for hours only to get the run-around and to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat who only has 10 minutes to give you and who doesn't value the talk. So it's no wonder that some men don't want to be bothered and skip going to the doctor altogether, especially if they feel fine.But herein lies the problem. You can feel just fine while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs.This is Denny Moe, owner of Denny Moe's Superstar Barbershop in Harlem. I've been lucky enough to have Denny as my barber for the last eight years.He said to me once, \"Hey Doc, you know, lots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors.\"This was stunning to me, at first, but not so much when you think about it. Black men have been with their current barbers on average as long as I've been with Denny, about eight years. And black men see their barbers about every two weeks. Not only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style, but you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life. Denny, like many barbers, is more than just an artist, a businessman and confidant. He's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well-being of his community. The very first time I walked into Denny Moe's shop, he wasn't just cutting hair. He was also orchestrating a voter registration drive to give a voice to his customers and his community.With this kind of activism, and community investment that typifies the black barbershop, of course the barbershop is a perfect place to talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community.First, the barbershop is not a medical setting, and so it doesn't have all the negative psychological baggage that comes along with that. When you're in a barbershop, you're in your territory, and you're among friends who share your history, your struggle and your health risks.Second, because the barbershop is a place of connection, loyalty and trust, it's a place where you're more open to have a conversation about health and especially about high blood pressure. After all, conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk: stress and high blood pressure, food and high blood pressure, relationships and high blood pressure, and yes, what it's like to be a black man in America and high blood pressure.But you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop. You can concretely take action. Here we have an opportunity to partner with the Denny Moe's of the world and empower communities to address the health inequities that uniquely affect it. When high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals to communities in the 1960s and '70s, black physicians like Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans were at the forefront of bringing health promotion to community hubs in urban black neighborhoods.These pioneers paved the way for my professional journey with barbershops and health, which began in Chicago in medical school.The very first research project that I worked on as a medical student was to help design healthcare interventions that would appeal to black men. We conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad cross-section of black men, and we learned that for them, being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy, and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good. This work led to the development of Project Brotherhood, a community clinic founded by Dr. Eric Whitaker that provided tailored healthcare to black men. Part of this tailored care involved having a barber on the premises to reward the men who came for needed healthcare with a free haircut, to let the men know that we, too, valued how they looked as well as how they felt, and that what was important to them was also important to us.But while there's only one Project Brotherhood, there are thousands of black barbershops where the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated. The next stop on my journey was Dallas, Texas, where we learned that barbers were not only willing but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate in delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers and their community. We teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers and taught them how to measure blood pressure and how to counsel their customers and refer them to doctors to help manage high blood pressure. The barbers were not only willing to do it but they were damn good at it. Over a three-year period, the barbers measured thousands of blood pressures resulting in hundreds of black men being referred to doctors for medical care of their high blood pressure. These barber-doctor partnerships resulted in a 20 percent increase in the number of men who were able to achieve target blood pressure levels and a three-point drop, on average, in the blood pressure of each participant. If we were to extrapolate that three point drop to every single black man with high blood pressure in America, we would prevent 800 heart attacks, 500 strokes and 900 deaths from high blood pressure in just one year.And our experience with barbershops has been no different in New York City, where my journey has currently led me. With an incredible team of diverse research assistants, community health workers and volunteers, we've been able to partner with over 200 barbershops and other trusted community venues to reach over 7,000 older black men. And we've offered high blood pressure screening and counseling to each and every one of them. Thanks to Denny Moe and the myriad other barbers and community leaders who shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment to make a difference in their communities, we've been able to not only lower blood pressure in our participants, but we've also been able to impact other health indicators.So what do you see? What is your barbershop? Where is that place for you where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution? When you find that place, see the opportunity.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2512, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:15.934\nWhat do you

the negative psychological baggage\n\n00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:30.735\nthat comes along with that.\n\n00:07:31.386 --> 00:07:33.441\nWhen you're in a barbershop,\n\n00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:36.894\nyou're in your territory,\nand you're among friends\n\n00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:39.180\nwho share your history,\n\n00:07:39.204 --> 00:07:42.617\nyour struggle and your health risks.\n\n00:07:43.266 --> 00:07:47.327\nSecond, because the barbershop\nis a place of connection,\n\n00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:49.853\nloyalty and trust,\n\n00:07:49.877 --> 00:07:53.386\nit's a place where you're more open\nto have a conversation about health\n\n00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.433\nand especially about high blood pressure.\n\n00:07:56.123 --> 00:07:57.593\nAfter all,\n\n00:07:57.617 --> 00:08:01.831\nconversations about high blood pressure\nhave all the elements of great shop talk:\n\n00:08:02.975 --> 00:08:05.576\nstress and high blood pressure,\n\n00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.130\nfood and high blood pressure,\n\n00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.791\nrelationships and high blood pressure,\n\n00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:14.750\nand yes, what it's like\nto be a black man in America\n\n00:08:14.774 --> 00:08:16.004\nand high blood pressure.\n\n00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:20.876\nBut you can do more than just talk\nabout high blood pressure\n\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.139\nin the barbershop.\n\n00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:24.742\nYou can concretely take action.\n\n00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:30.631\nHere we have an opportunity to partner\nwith the Denny Moe's of the world\n\n00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:34.933\nand empower communities\nto address the health inequities\n\n00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:36.262\nthat uniquely affect it.\n\n00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:40.782\nWhen high blood pressure screening\nexpanded from clinics and hospitals\n\n00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:43.933\nto communities in the 1960s and '70s,\n\n00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:47.314\nblack physicians like\nDr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore\n\n00:08:47.338 --> 00:08:49.823\nand Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans\n\n00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:53.922\nwere at the forefront of bringing\nhealth promotion to community hubs\n\n00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:55.434\nin urban black neighborhoods.\n\n00:08:56.367 --> 00:09:00.507\nThese pioneers paved the way\nfor my professional journey\n\n00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:02.514\nwith barbershops and health,\n\n00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:05.823\nwhich began in Chicago in medical school.\n\n00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.812\nThe very first research project\nthat I worked on as a medical student\n\n00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:13.336\nwas to help design\nhealthcare interventions\n\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.633\nthat would appeal to black men.\n\n00:09:16.802 --> 00:09:19.685\nWe conducted about a dozen focus groups\n\n00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:22.984\nwith a broad cross-section of black men,\n\n00:09:23.008 --> 00:09:25.122\nand we learned that for them,\n\n00:09:25.146 --> 00:09:29.529\nbeing healthy was as much about\nbeing perceived as healthy\n\n00:09:29.553 --> 00:09:31.801\nas it was about feeling healthy,\n\n00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:36.078\nand that feeling good\nwent hand in hand with looking good.\n\n00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:41.816\nThis work led to the development\nof Project Brotherhood,\n\n00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.745\na community clinic founded\nby Dr. Eric Whitaker\n\n00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:47.562\nthat provided tailored\nhealthcare to black men.\n\n00:09:48.673 --> 00:09:50.681\nPart of this tailored care\n\n00:09:50.705 --> 00:09:53.506\ninvolved having a barber on the premises\n\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.133\nto reward the men who came\nfor needed healthcare\n\n00:09:57.157 --> 00:09:59.122\nwith a free haircut,\n\n00:09:59.146 --> 00:10:03.092\nto let the men know that we, too,\nvalued how they looked\n\n00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:04.986\nas well as how they felt,\n\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.192\nand that what was important to them\nwas also important to us.\n\n00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:13.506\nBut while there's only one\nProject Brotherhood,\n\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.851\nthere are thousands of black barbershops\n\n00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:21.351\nwhere the intersection of health\nand haircuts can be cultivated.\n\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.112\nThe next stop on my journey\nwas Dallas, Texas,\n\n00:10:26.136 --> 00:10:29.153\nwhere we learned that barbers\nwere not only willing\n\n00:10:29.177 --> 00:10:33.216\nbut fully able to roll up\ntheir sleeves and participate\n\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.764\nin delivering needed health services\nto improve the health of their customers\n\n00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:40.042\nand their community.\n\n00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:44.347\nWe teamed up with an amazing\ncadre of black barbers\n\n00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:46.515\nand taught them how\nto measure blood pressure\n\n00:10:46.539 --> 00:10:48.320\nand how to counsel their customers\n\n00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:50.171\nand refer them to doctors\n\n00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:52.039\nto help manage high blood pressure.\n\n00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:55.197\nThe barbers were not only willing to do it\n\n00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:56.689\nbut they were damn good at it.\n\n00:10:57.752 --> 00:10:59.706\nOver a three-year period,\n\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.674\nthe barbers measured\nthousands of blood pressures\n\n00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:07.499\nresulting in hundreds of black men\nbeing referred to doctors\n\n00:11:07.523 --> 00:11:10.603\nfor medical care\nof their high blood pressure.\n\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.102\nThese barber-doctor partnerships\n\n00:11:14.126 --> 00:11:18.610\nresulted in a 20 percent increase\nin the number of men\n\n00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:21.427\nwho were able to achieve\ntarget blood pressure levels\n\n00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:23.911\nand a three-point drop, on average,\n\n00:11:23.935 --> 00:11:25.935\nin the blood pressure of each participant.\n\n00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:29.347\nIf we were to extrapolate\nthat three point drop\n\n00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:32.776\nto every single black man\nwith high blood pressure in America,\n\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:39.047\nwe would prevent 800 heart attacks,\n500 strokes and 900 deaths\n\n00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:40.929\nfrom high blood pressure\n\n00:11:40.953 --> 00:11:42.855\nin just one year.\n\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.982\nAnd our experience with barbershops\nhas been no different in New York City,\n\n00:11:49.006 --> 00:11:50.855\nwhere my journey has currently led me.\n\n00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.624\nWith an incredible team\nof diverse research assistants,\n\n00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:58.774\ncommunity health workers and volunteers,\n\n00:11:58.798 --> 00:12:02.199\nwe've been able to partner\nwith over 200 barbershops\n\n00:12:02.223 --> 00:12:04.707\nand other trusted community venues\n\n00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:07.992\nto reach over 7,000 older black men.\n\n00:12:08.522 --> 00:12:11.435\nAnd we've offered high blood pressure\nscreening and counseling\n\n00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:12.895\nto each and every one of them.\n\n00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:15.453\nThanks to Denny Moe\n\n00:12:15.477 --> 00:12:19.080\nand the myriad other barbers\nand community leaders\n\n00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:24.048\nwho shared the vision of opportunity\nand empowerment\n\n00:12:24.072 --> 00:12:26.778\nto make a difference in their communities,\n\n00:12:26.802 --> 00:12:29.557\nwe've been able to not only\nlower blood pressure\n\n00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:31.041\nin our participants,\n\n00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:34.777\nbut we've also been able to impact\nother health indicators.\n\n00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.580\nSo what do you see?\n\n00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.160\nWhat is your barbershop?\n\n00:12:45.652 --> 00:12:48.501\nWhere is that place for you\n\n00:12:49.532 --> 00:12:52.461\nwhere people who are affected\nby a unique problem\n\n00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:54.866\ncan meet a unique solution?\n\n00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:01.640\nWhen you find that place,\nsee the opportunity.\n\n00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:03.712\nThank you.\n\n00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:07.180\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My journey from Marine to actor", "duration": "1082", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_driver_my_journey_from_marine_to_actor", "transcript": "I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company, 81's platoon, out in Camp Pendleton, California. Oorah!Audience: Oorah!(Laughter)I joined a few months after September 11, feeling like I think most people in the country did at the time, filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution and the desire to do something \u2014 that, coupled with that fact that I wasn't doing anything. I was 17, just graduated from high school that past summer, living in the back room of my parents' house paying rent, in the small town I was raised in in Northern Indiana, called Mishawaka. I can spell that later for people who are interested \u2014(Laughter)Mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not, so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays I did in high school and Blockbuster Video, may she rest in peace.(Laughter)I was serious enough about acting that I auditioned for Juilliard when I was a senior in high school, didn't get in, determined college wasn't for me and applied nowhere else, which was a genius move. I also did that Hail Mary LA acting odyssey that I always heard stories about, of actors moving to LA with, like, seven dollars and finding work and successful careers. I got as far as Amarillo, Texas, before my car broke down. I spent all my money repairing it, finally made it to Santa Monica \u2014 not even LA \u2014 stayed for 48 hours wandering the beach, basically, got in my car, drove home, thus ending my acting career, so \u2014(Laughter)Seventeen, Mishawaka ... parents' house, paying rent, selling vacuums ... telemarketing, cutting grass at the local 4-H fairgrounds. This was my world going into September, 2001.So after the 11th, and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty, and just being pissed off in general \u2014 at myself, my parents, the government; not having confidence, not having a respectable job, my shitty mini-fridge that I just drove to California and back \u2014 I joined the Marine Corps and loved it. I loved being a Marine. It's one of the things I'm most proud of having done in my life. Firing weapons was cool, driving and detonating expensive things was great. But I found I loved the Marine Corps the most for the thing I was looking for the least when I joined, which was the people: these weird dudes \u2014 a motley crew of characters from a cross section of the United States \u2014 that on the surface I had nothing in common with. And over time, all the political and personal bravado that led me to the military dissolved, and for me, the Marine Corps became synonymous with my friends.And then, a few years into my service and months away from deploying to Iraq, I dislocated my sternum in a mountain-biking accident, and had to be medically separated. Those never in the military may find this hard to understand, but being told I wasn't getting deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan was very devastating for me. I have a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher and my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if I was OK.And then, suddenly, I was a civilian again. I knew I wanted to give acting another shot, because \u2014 again, this is me \u2014 I thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military. I mean, what can you really bitch about now, you know? \"It's hot. Someone should turn on the air conditioner.\" \"This coffee line is too long.\" I was a Marine, I knew how to survive. I'd go to New York and become an actor. If things didn't work out, I'd live in Central Park and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.(Laughter)I re-auditioned for Juilliard and this time I was lucky, I got in. But I was surprised by how complex the transition was from military to civilian. And I was relatively healthy; I can't imagine going through that process on top of a mental or physical injury. But regardless, it was difficult. In part, because I was in acting school \u2014 I couldn't justify going to voice and speech class, throwing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room, doing acting exercises where I gave birth to myself \u2014(Laughter)while my friends were serving without me overseas. But also, because I didn't know how to apply the things I learned in the military to a civilian context. I mean that both practically and emotionally. Practically, I had to get a job. And I was an Infantry Marine, where you're shooting machine guns and firing mortars. There's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world.(Laughter)Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning. In the military, everything has meaning. Everything you do is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose. You can't smoke in the field because you don't want to give away your position. You don't touch your face \u2014 you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene. You face this way when \"Colors\" plays, out of respect for people who went before you. Walk this way, talk this way because of this. Your uniform is maintained to the inch. How diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes about the kind of Marine you were. Your rank said something about your history and the respect you had earned.In the civilian world there's no rank. Here you're just another body, and I felt like I constantly had to prove my worth all over again. And the respect civilians were giving me while I was in uniform didn't exist when I was out of it. There didn't seem to be a ... a sense of community, whereas in the military, I felt this sense of community. How often in the civilian world are you put in a life-or-death situation with your closest friends and they constantly demonstrate that they're not going to abandon you? And meanwhile, at acting school ...(Laughter)I was really, for the first time, discovering playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military, but were somehow describing my military experience in a way that before to me was indescribable. And I felt myself becoming less aggressive as I was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing what a valuable tool that was.And when I was reflecting on my time in the military, I wasn't first thinking on the stereotypical drills and discipline and pain of it; but rather, the small, intimate human moments, moments of great feeling: friends going AWOL because they missed their families, friends getting divorced, grieving together, celebrating together, all within the backdrop of the military. I saw my friends battling these circumstances, and I watched the anxiety it produced in them and me, not being able to express our feelings about it.The military and theater communities are actually very similar. You have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves; it's not about you. You have a role, you have to know your role within that team. Every team has a leader or director; sometimes they're smart, sometimes they're not. You're forced to be intimate with complete strangers in a short amount of time; the self-discipline, the self-maintenance. I thought, how great would it be to create a space that combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities, that brought entertainment to a group of people that, considering their occupation, could handle something a bit more thought-provoking than the typical mandatory-fun events that I remember being \"volun-told\" to go to in the military \u2014(Laughter)all well-intended but slightly offensive events, like \"Win a Date with a San Diego Chargers Cheerleader,\" where you answer a question about pop culture, and if you get it right you win a date, which was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck with this already married, pregnant cheerleader \u2014(Laughter)Nothing against cheerleaders, I love cheerleaders. The point is more, how great would it be to have theater presented through characters that were accessible without being condescending. So we started this nonprofit called Arts in the Armed Forces, where we tried to do that, tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities. We pick a play or select monologues from contemporary American plays that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is, grab a group of incredible theater-trained actors, arm them with incredible material, keep production value as minimal as possible \u2014 no sets, no costumes, no lights, just reading it \u2014 to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can be created at any setting.It's a powerful thing, getting in a room with complete strangers and reminding ourselves of our humanity, and that self-expression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder. And for an organization like the military, that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms, you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience. And I can think of no better community to arm with a new means of self-expression than those protecting our country.We've gone all over the United States and the world, from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland, to Camp Pendleton, to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, to USAG Bavaria, on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York. And for the performing artists we bring, it's a window into a culture they otherwise would not have had exposure to. And for the military, it's the exact same.And in doing this for the past six years, I'm always reminded that acting is many things. It's a craft, it's a political act, it's a business, it's \u2014 whatever adjective is most applicable to you. But it's also a service. I didn't get to finish mine, so whenever I get to be of service to this ultimate service industry, the military, for me, again \u2014 there's not many things better than that.Thank you.(Applause)We're going to be doing a piece from Marco Ramirez, called \"I am not Batman.\" An incredible actor and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez, is going to be reading, and Matt Johnson, who I just met a couple hours ago. They're doing it together for the first time, so we'll see how it goes.Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.(Applause)Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night and the sky is glowing like mad, radioactive red. And if you squint, you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city, like a mosquito net that won't let the angels in.(Drum beat)And if you look up high enough, you can see me standing on the edge of an 87-story building. And up there, a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead for maybe like 100 years, up there is me.(Beat)And I'm frickin' Batman.(Beat)And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs and frickin' bat caves, like, for real. And all it takes is a broom closet or a back room or a fire escape, and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone. And my navy blue polo shirt, the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got snagged on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's but it isn't even a big deal because I tuck that part in and it's, like, all good. That blue polo shirt \u2014 it's gone, too! And I get like, like ... transformational.(Beat)And nobody pulls out a belt and whips Batman for talkin' back.(Beat)Or for not talkin' back.And nobody calls Batman simple or stupid or skinny. And nobody fires Batman's brother from the Eastern Taxi Company 'cause they was making cutbacks, neither. 'Cause they got nothing but respect. And not like afraid-respect, just, like, respect-respect.(Laughter)'Cause nobody's afraid of you. 'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.(Beat)Ever. (Double beat)'Cause all Batman really wants to do is save people and maybe pay abuela's bills one day and die happy. And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.(Laughter)Oh \u2014 and kill the Joker.(Drum roll)Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone. And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin' like a eagle or like a \u2014 no, yeah, like a eagle.(Laughter)And my cape is flapping in the wind cause it's frickin' long and my pointy ears are on, and that mask that covers like half my face is on, too, and I got, like, bulletproof stuff all in my chest so no one can hurt me. And nobody \u2014 nobody! \u2014 is gonna come between Batman ... and justice.(Drums) (Laughter)From where I am, I can hear everything.(Silence)Somewhere in the city, there's a old lady picking Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can and she's putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out into her own mouth. And somewhere there's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat trying to find a cure for the diseases that are gonna make us all extinct for real one day. And somewhere there's a man, a man in a janitor's uniform, stumbling home drunk and dizzy after spending half his paycheck on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer, and the other half on a four-hour visit to some lady's house on a street where the lights have all been shot out by people who'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark. And half a block away from janitor man, there's a group of good-for-nothings who don't know no better, waiting for janitor man with rusted bicycle chains and imitation Louisville Sluggers, and if they don't find a cent on him, which they won't, they'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning, till there's no more teeth to crack out.But they don't count on me. They don't count on no Dark Knight, with a stomach full of grocery-store brand macaroni and cheese and cut-up Vienna sausages.(Laughter)'Cause they'd rather believe I don't exist.And from 87 stories up, I can hear one of the good-for-nothings say, \"Gimme the cash!\" \u2014 real fast like that, just, \"Gimme me the fuckin' cash!\" And I see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale, and from 87 stories up, I can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his Dickies.So I swoop down, like, mad-fast and I'm like darkness, I'm like, \"Swoosh!\" And I throw a batarang at the one naked lightbulb.(Cymbal)And they're all like, \"Whoa, muthafucker! Who just turned out the lights?\"(Laughter)\"What's that over there?\" \"What?\"\"Gimme me what you got, old man!\"\"Did anybody hear that?\" \"Hear what? There ain't nothing. No, really \u2014 there ain't no bat!\"But then ... one out of the three good-for-nothings gets it to the head \u2014 pow!And number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him, but before his fist hits anything, I grab a trash can lid and \u2014 right in the gut! And number one comes back with the jump kick, but I know judo karate, too, so I'm like \u2014(Drums)Twice!(Drums)(Laughter)(Drums)But before I can do any more damage, suddenly we all hear a \"click-click.\" And suddenly everything gets quiet. And the one good-for-nothing left standing grips a handgun and aims it straight up, like he's holding Jesus hostage, like he's threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon. And the good-for-nothing who got it to the head, who tried to jump-kick me, and the other good-for-nothing who got it in the gut, is both scrambling back away from the dark figure before 'em. And the drunk man, the janitor man, is huddled in a corner, praying to Saint Anthony 'cause that's the only one he could remember.(Double beat) And there's me: eyes glowing white, cape blowing softly in the wind.(Beat) Bulletproof chest heaving, my heart beating right through it in a Morse code for: \"Fuck with me just once come on just try.\"And the one good-for-nothing left standing, the one with the handgun \u2014 yeah, he laughs. And he lowers his arm. And he points it at me and gives the moon a break. And he aims it right between my pointy ears, like goal posts and he's special teams. And janitor man is still calling Saint Anthony, but he ain't pickin' up. And for a second, it seems like ... maybe I'm gonna lose.Nah!(Drums)Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!\"Don't kill me, man!\"Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!Skin meets acid: \"Ahhhhhhh!\"And he's on the floor and I'm standing over him and I got the gun in my hands now and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em 'cause I'm Batman. And, asterisk: Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago. But for just a second, my eyes glow white, and I hold this thing for I could speak to the good-for-nothing in a language he maybe understands. Click-click!(Beat)And the good-for-nothings become good-for-disappearing into whatever toxic waste, chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of. And it's just me and janitor man. And I pick him up, and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead. And he begs me not to hurt him and I grab him tight by his janitor-man shirt collar, and I pull him to my face and he's taller than me but the cape helps, so he listens when I look him straight in the eyes. And I say two words to him: \"Go home.\"And he does, checking behind his shoulder every 10 feet. And I swoosh from building to building on his way there 'cause I know where he lives. And I watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain and opens the door to his building. And I'm back in bed before he even walks in through the front door.And I hear him turn on the faucet and pour himself a glass of warm tap water. And he puts the glass back in the sink. And I hear his footsteps. And they get slower as they get to my room. And he creaks my door open, like, mad-slow. And he takes a step in, which he never does.(Beat) And he's staring off into nowhere, his face, the color of sidewalks in summer. And I act like I'm just waking up and I say, \"Ah, what's up, Pop?\" And janitor man says nothing to me. But I see in the dark, I see his arms go limp and his head turns back, like, towards me. And he lifts it for I can see his face, for I could see his eyes. And his cheeks is drippin', but not with sweat. And he just stands there breathing, like he remembers my eyes glowing white, like he remembers my bulletproof chest, like he remembers he's my pop. And for a long time I don't say nothin'. And he turns around, hand on the doorknob. And he ain't looking my way, but I hear him mumble two words to me: \"I'm sorry.\"And I lean over, and I open my window just a crack. If you look up high enough, you could see me. And from where I am \u2014(Cymbals)I could hear everything.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2513, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.185 -->

retribution\n\n00:00:30.182 --> 00:00:31.824\nand the desire to do something --\n\n00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:34.593\nthat, coupled with that fact\nthat I wasn't doing anything.\n\n00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.863\nI was 17, just graduated\nfrom high school that past summer,\n\n00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:40.589\nliving in the back room\nof my parents' house paying rent,\n\n00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:43.202\nin the small town I was raised in\nin Northern Indiana,\n\n00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:44.384\ncalled Mishawaka.\n\n00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:46.986\nI can spell that later\nfor people who are

00:00:53.818\nso my only exposure to theater and film\n\n00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:55.971\nwas limited to the plays\nI did in high school\n\n00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:58.223\nand Blockbuster Video,\nmay she

I was a senior in high school,\n\n00:01:04.446 --> 00:01:05.597\ndidn't get in,\n\n00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.347\ndetermined college wasn't for me\nand applied nowhere else,\n\n00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:09.664\nwhich was a genius move.\n\n00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:13.139\nI also did that Hail Mary\nLA acting odyssey\n\n00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:14.798\nthat I always heard stories about,\n\n00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:17.123\nof actors moving to LA\nwith, like, seven dollars\n\n00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:19.090\nand finding work and successful careers.\n\n00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:22.470\nI got as far as Amarillo, Texas,\nbefore my car broke down.\n\n00:01:22.494 --> 00:01:24.221\nI spent all my money repairing it,\n\n00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:25.890\nfinally made it to Santa Monica --\n\n00:01:25.914 --> 00:01:27.192\nnot even LA --\n\n00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:29.875\nstayed for 48 hours wandering\nthe beach, basically,\n\n00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.185\ngot in my car, drove home,\n\n00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:32.915\nthus ending my acting career, so --\n\n00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.217\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.129\nSeventeen, Mishawaka ...\n\n00:01:36.153 --> 00:01:39.981\nparents' house, paying rent,\nselling vacuums ...\n\n00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:41.560\ntelemarketing,\n\n00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:43.767\ncutting grass at the local\n4-H fairgrounds.\n\n00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.083\nThis was my world\ngoing into September, 2001.\n\n00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:47.258\nSo after the 11th,\n\n00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:49.484\nand feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,\n\n00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.859\nand just being pissed off\nin general -- at myself,\n\n00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.279\nmy parents, the government;\n\n00:01:53.303 --> 00:01:55.756\nnot having confidence,\nnot having a respectable job,\n\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.882\nmy shitty mini-fridge that I just\ndrove to California and back --\n\n00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:01.879\nI joined the Marine Corps and loved it.\nI loved being a Marine.\n\n00:02:01.903 --> 00:02:04.941\nIt's one of the things I'm most proud\nof having done in my life.\n\n00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.131\nFiring weapons was cool,\n\n00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:08.590\ndriving and detonating\nexpensive things was great.\n\n00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:10.722\nBut I found I loved\nthe Marine Corps the most\n\n00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:13.387\nfor the thing I was looking\nfor the least when I joined,\n\n00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.572\nwhich was the people:\n\n00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:18.176\nthese weird dudes --\na motley crew of characters\n\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.582\nfrom a cross section\nof the United States --\n\n00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:22.937\nthat on the surface I had\nnothing in common with.\n\n00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.569\nAnd over time,\n\n00:02:24.593 --> 00:02:26.419\nall the political and personal bravado\n\n00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:28.320\nthat led me to the military dissolved,\n\n00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:31.326\nand for me, the Marine Corps\nbecame synonymous with my friends.\n\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.638\nAnd then, a few years into my service\n\n00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:35.741\nand months away from deploying to Iraq,\n\n00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:38.630\nI dislocated my sternum\nin a mountain-biking accident,\n\n00:02:38.654 --> 00:02:40.296\nand had to be medically separated.\n\n00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.253\nThose never in the military\nmay find this hard to understand,\n\n00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:46.340\nbut being told I wasn't getting deployed\nto Iraq or Afghanistan\n\n00:02:46.364 --> 00:02:47.807\nwas very devastating for me.\n\n00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:51.072\nI have a very clear image of leaving\nthe base hospital on a stretcher\n\n00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:53.966\nand my entire platoon is waiting\noutside to see if I was OK.\n\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.424\nAnd then, suddenly,\nI was a civilian again.\n\n00:02:56.448 --> 00:02:58.653\nI knew I wanted to give\nacting another shot,\n\n00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.481\nbecause -- again, this is me --\n\n00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:04.224\nI thought all civilian problems\nare small compared to the military.\n\n00:03:04.248 --> 00:03:07.005\nI mean, what can you really\nbitch about now, you know?\n\n00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.201\n\"It's hot.\n\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.862\nSomeone should turn\non the air conditioner.\"\n\n00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:12.686\n\"This coffee line is too long.\"\n\n00:03:13.113 --> 00:03:14.265\nI was a Marine,\n\n00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:15.440\nI knew how to survive.\n\n00:03:15.464 --> 00:03:17.402\nI'd go to New York and become an actor.\n\n00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:18.687\nIf things didn't work out,\n\n00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:21.695\nI'd live in Central Park\nand dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.\n\n00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.720\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.434\nI re-auditioned for Juilliard\nand this time I was lucky,\n\n00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:26.609\nI got in.\n\n00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:29.174\nBut I was surprised\nby how complex the transition was\n\n00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:30.499\nfrom military to civilian.\n\n00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:33.998\nAnd I was relatively healthy; I can't\nimagine going through that process\n\n00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:35.884\non top of a mental or physical injury.\n\n00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:37.499\nBut regardless, it was difficult.\n\n00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:39.693\nIn part, because I was in acting school --\n\n00:03:39.717 --> 00:03:43.254\nI couldn't justify going\nto voice and speech class,\n\n00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:46.546\nthrowing imaginary balls of energy\nat the back of the room,\n\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.133\ndoing acting exercises\nwhere I gave birth to myself --\n\n00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:50.158\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:50.182 --> 00:03:52.916\nwhile my friends were serving\nwithout me overseas.\n\n00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.549\nBut also, because I didn't\nknow how to apply the things\n\n00:03:55.573 --> 00:03:57.926\nI learned in the military\nto a civilian context.\n\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.109\nI mean that both practically\nand emotionally.\n\n00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:01.702\nPractically, I had to get a job.\n\n00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.458\nAnd I was an Infantry Marine,\n\n00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:06.038\nwhere you're shooting machine guns\nand firing mortars.\n\n00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:09.609\nThere's not a lot of places you can\nput those skills in the civilian world.\n\n00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:10.634\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:12.680\nEmotionally, I struggled to find meaning.\n\n00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:15.022\nIn the military, everything has meaning.\n\n00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.299\nEverything you do\nis either steeped in tradition\n\n00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:18.651\nor has a practical purpose.\n\n00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.028\nYou can't smoke in the field\n\n00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:22.403\nbecause you don't want\nto give away your position.\n\n00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:24.722\nYou don't touch your face --\nyou have to maintain\n\n00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:26.628\na personal level of health and hygiene.\n\n00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:28.478\nYou face this way when \"Colors\" plays,\n\n00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:30.692\nout of respect for people\nwho went before you.\n\n00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:32.856\nWalk this way, talk this way\nbecause of this.\n\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.760\nYour uniform is maintained to the inch.\n\n00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:37.277\nHow diligently you followed\nthose rules spoke volumes\n\n00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.936\nabout the kind of Marine you were.\n\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.988\nYour rank said something\nabout your history\n\n00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:42.496\nand the respect you had earned.\n\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.352\nIn the civilian world there's no rank.\n\n00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:45.815\nHere you're just another body,\n\n00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.046\nand I felt like I constantly had\nto prove my worth all over again.\n\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.070\nAnd the respect civilians were giving me\nwhile I was in uniform\n\n00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:53.720\ndidn't exist when I was out of it.\n\n00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:55.497\nThere didn't seem to be a ...\n\n00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:56.721\na sense of community,\n\n00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:59.411\nwhereas in the military,\nI felt this sense of community.\n\n00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:01.164\nHow often in the civilian world\n\n00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:04.940\nare you put in a life-or-death situation\nwith your closest friends\n\n00:05:04.964 --> 00:05:08.270\nand they constantly demonstrate\nthat they're not going to abandon you?\n\n00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:10.347\nAnd meanwhile, at acting school ...\n\n00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:12.829\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:12.853 --> 00:05:14.527\nI was really, for the first time,\n\n00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:16.836\ndiscovering playwrights\nand characters and plays\n\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.823\nthat had nothing to do with the military,\n\n00:05:18.847 --> 00:05:21.202\nbut were somehow describing\nmy military experience\n\n00:05:21.226 --> 00:05:23.773\nin a way that before\nto me was indescribable.\n\n00:05:23.797 --> 00:05:26.188\nAnd I felt myself becoming less aggressive\n\n00:05:26.212 --> 00:05:29.415\nas I was able to put words\nto feelings for the first time\n\n00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.558\nand realizing what\na valuable tool that was.\n\n00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:34.062\nAnd when I was reflecting\non my time in the military,\n\n00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:36.497\nI wasn't first thinking\non the stereotypical drills\n\n00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.973\nand discipline and pain of it;\n\n00:05:37.997 --> 00:05:40.211\nbut rather, the small,\nintimate human moments,\n\n00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:41.568\nmoments of great feeling:\n\n00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:44.217\nfriends going AWOL\nbecause they missed their families,\n\n00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:45.476\nfriends getting divorced,\n\n00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.498\ngrieving together, celebrating together,\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:49.457\nall within the backdrop of the military.\n\n00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:51.763\nI saw my friends battling\nthese circumstances,\n\n00:05:51.787 --> 00:05:54.818\nand I watched the anxiety\nit produced in them and me,\n\n00:05:54.842 --> 00:05:57.428\nnot being able to express\nour feelings about it.\n\n00:05:57.984 --> 00:06:01.032\nThe military and theater communities\nare actually very similar.\n\n00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:03.781\nYou have a group of people\ntrying to accomplish a mission\n\n00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:05.868\ngreater than themselves;\nit's not about you.\n\n00:06:05.892 --> 00:06:08.860\nYou have a role, you have to know\nyour role within that team.\n\n00:06:08.884 --> 00:06:11.043\nEvery team has a leader or director;\n\n00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:13.617\nsometimes they're smart,\nsometimes they're not.\n\n00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:16.245\nYou're forced to be intimate\nwith complete strangers\n\n00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:17.554\nin a short amount of time;\n\n00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.625\nthe self-discipline, the self-maintenance.\n\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.573\nI thought, how great would it be\nto create a space\n\n00:06:22.597 --> 00:06:25.924\nthat combined these two seemingly\ndissimilar communities,\n\n00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:28.183\nthat brought entertainment\nto a group of people\n\n00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:30.302\nthat, considering their occupation,\n\n00:06:30.326 --> 00:06:32.770\ncould handle something\na bit more thought-provoking\n\n00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:34.627\nthan the typical mandatory-fun events\n\n00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:37.712\nthat I remember being\n\"volun-told\" to go to in the military --\n\n00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:38.738\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:38.762 --> 00:06:41.040\nall well-intended but slightly\noffensive events,\n\n00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:43.715\nlike \"Win a Date with a San Diego\nChargers Cheerleader,\"\n\n00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:45.915\nwhere you answer a question\nabout pop culture,\n\n00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.832\nand if you get it right you win a date,\n\n00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:50.202\nwhich was a chaperoned walk\naround the parade deck\n\n00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:52.617\nwith this already married,\npregnant cheerleader --\n\n00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:53.808\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:53.832 --> 00:06:56.212\nNothing against cheerleaders,\nI love cheerleaders.\n\n00:06:56.236 --> 00:06:59.348\nThe point is more, how great would it\nbe to have theater presented\n\n00:06:59.372 --> 00:07:02.596\nthrough characters that were accessible\nwithout being condescending.\n\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.525\nSo we started this nonprofit\ncalled Arts in the Armed Forces,\n\n00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:07.204\nwhere we tried to do that,\n\n00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:10.146\ntried to join these two seemingly\ndissimilar communities.\n\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.985\nWe pick a play or select monologues\nfrom contemporary American plays\n\n00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.683\nthat are diverse in age and race\nlike a military audience is,\n\n00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:20.056\ngrab a group of incredible\ntheater-trained actors,\n\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.933\narm them with incredible material,\n\n00:07:21.957 --> 00:07:24.177\nkeep production value\nas minimal as possible --\n\n00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:27.237\nno sets, no costumes,\nno lights, just reading it --\n\n00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:29.740\nto throw all the emphasis on the language\n\n00:07:29.764 --> 00:07:32.479\nand to show that theater can\nbe created at any setting.\n\n00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:33.683\nIt's a powerful thing,\n\n00:07:33.707 --> 00:07:36.593\ngetting in a room with complete strangers\n\n00:07:36.617 --> 00:07:39.265\nand reminding ourselves of our humanity,\n\n00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:41.686\nand that self-expression\nis just as valuable a tool\n\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.067\nas a rifle on your shoulder.\n\n00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:45.096\nAnd for an organization like the military,\n\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.047\nthat prides itself on having\nacronyms for acronyms,\n\n00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.494\nyou can get lost in the sauce\n\n00:07:49.518 --> 00:07:52.200\nwhen it comes to explaining\na collective experience.\n\n00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:54.068\nAnd I can think of no better community\n\n00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:56.163\nto arm with a new means of self-expression\n\n00:07:56.187 --> 00:07:58.209\nthan those protecting our country.\n\n00:07:58.233 --> 00:08:00.713\nWe've gone all over\nthe United States and the world,\n\n00:08:00.737 --> 00:08:03.418\nfrom Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,\n\n00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:05.888\nto Camp Pendleton,\nto Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,\n\n00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:07.621\nto USAG Bavaria,\n\n00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:09.685\non- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.\n\n00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:11.781\nAnd for the performing artists we bring,\n\n00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:13.473\nit's a window into a culture\n\n00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:15.657\nthey otherwise would not\nhave had exposure to.\n\n00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.700\nAnd for the military, it's the exact same.\n\n00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:19.711\nAnd in doing this for the past six years,\n\n00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:21.966\nI'm always reminded\nthat acting is many things.\n\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.195\nIt's a craft, it's a political act,\nit's a business, it's --\n\n00:08:25.846 --> 00:08:27.971\nwhatever adjective\nis most applicable to you.\n\n00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:29.434\nBut it's also a service.\n\n00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.982\nI didn't get to finish mine,\n\n00:08:31.006 --> 00:08:32.638\nso whenever I get to be of service\n\n00:08:32.662 --> 00:08:35.939\nto this ultimate service industry,\nthe military, for me, again --\n\n00:08:35.963 --> 00:08:38.010\nthere's not many things better than that.\n\n00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:39.362\nThank you.\n\n00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:43.974\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:43.998 --> 00:08:47.922\nWe're going to be doing a piece\nfrom Marco Ramirez,\n\n00:08:47.946 --> 00:08:49.640\ncalled \"I am not Batman.\"\n\n00:08:49.664 --> 00:08:52.692\nAn incredible actor\nand good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,\n\n00:08:52.716 --> 00:08:53.891\nis going to be reading,\n\n00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:56.399\nand Matt Johnson,\nwho I just met a couple hours ago.\n\n00:08:56.423 --> 00:08:58.574\nThey're doing it together\nfor the first time,\n\n00:08:58.598 --> 00:08:59.836\nso we'll see how it goes.\n\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.779\nJesse Perez and Matt Johnson.\n\n00:09:01.803 --> 00:09:04.957\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:14.594\nJesse Perez: It's the middle of the night\n\n00:09:14.618 --> 00:09:16.928\nand the sky is glowing\nlike mad, radioactive red.\n\n00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:19.074\nAnd if you squint,\nyou can maybe see the moon\n\n00:09:19.098 --> 00:09:21.964\nthrough a thick layer of cigarette smoke\nand airplane exhaust\n\n00:09:21.988 --> 00:09:23.279\nthat covers the whole city,\n\n00:09:23.303 --> 00:09:25.601\nlike a mosquito net\nthat won't let the angels in.\n\n00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:26.665\n(Drum beat)\n\n00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:28.175\nAnd if you look up high enough,\n\n00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:31.636\nyou can see me standing\non the edge of an 87-story building.\n\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.087\nAnd up there, a place for gargoyles\nand broken clock towers\n\n00:09:35.111 -->

limp\n\n00:16:46.293 --> 00:16:48.407\nand his head turns back, like, towards me.\n\n00:16:48.431 --> 00:16:50.807\nAnd he lifts it for I can see his face,\n\n00:16:50.831 --> 00:16:52.697\nfor I could see his eyes.\n\n00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.093\nAnd his cheeks is drippin',\nbut not with sweat.\n\n00:16:55.662 --> 00:16:57.443\nAnd he just stands there breathing,\n\n00:16:57.467 -->

My mom, Jennie, took this picture. That's my dad, Frank, in the middle. And on his left, my sisters: Mary Catherine, Judith Ann, Theresa Marie. John Patrick's sitting on his lap and Kevin Michael's on his right. And in the pale-blue windbreaker, Susan Diane. Me. I loved growing up in a big family. And one of my favorite things was picking names. But by the time child number seven came along, we had nearly run out of middle names. It was a long deliberation before we finally settled on Jennifer Bridget. Every parent in this audience knows the joy and excitement of picking a new baby's name. And I was excited and thrilled to help my mom in that special ceremonial moment.But it's not like that everywhere. I travel a lot and I see a lot. But it took me by surprise to learn in an area of Ethiopia, parents delay picking the names for their new babies by a month or more. Why delay? Why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time? Well, they delay because they're afraid. They're afraid their baby will die. And this loss might be a little more bearable without a name. A face without a name might help them feel just a little less attached.So here we are in one part of the world \u2014 a time of joy, excitement, dreaming of the future of that child \u2014 while in another world, parents are filled with dread, not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks. How can that be? How can it be that 2.6 million babies die around the world before they're even one month old? 2.6 million. That's the population of Vancouver. And the shocking thing is: Why? In too many cases, we simply don't know.Now, I remember recently seeing an updated pie chart. And the pie chart was labeled, \"Causes of death in children under five worldwide.\" And there was a pretty big section of that pie chart, about 40 percent \u2014 40 percent was labeled \"neonatal.\" Now, \"neonatal\" is not a cause of death. Neonatal is simply an adjective, an adjective that means that the child is less than one month old. For me, \"neonatal\" said: \"We have no idea.\"Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor. I want to fix things. But you can't fix what you can't define. So our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents is to answer the question: Why are babies dying?So today, I want to talk about a new approach, an approach that I feel will not only help us know why babies are dying, but is beginning to completely transform the whole field of global health. It's called \"Precision Public Health.\"For me, precision medicine comes from a very special place. I trained as a cancer doctor, an oncologist. I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better. But too often my treatments made them feel worse. I still remember young women being driven to my clinic by their moms \u2014 adults, who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers. They were so weak from the treatment I had given them. But at the time, in those front lines in the war on cancer, we had few tools. And the tools we did have couldn't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve. And so the side effects that you're all very familiar with \u2014 hair loss, being sick to your stomach, having a suppressed immune system, so infection was a constant threat \u2014 were always surrounding us.And then I moved to the biotechnology industry. And I got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells. It's a drug called Herceptin. And what Herceptin allowed us to do is to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer, at the time, the scariest form of breast cancer. And that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells, while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells. A huge breakthrough. It felt like a miracle, so much so that today, we're harnessing all those tools \u2014 big data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and more \u2014 to tackle a broad variety of diseases. That's allowing us to target individuals with the right remedies at the right time.Precision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy. Everything changed. And I want everything to change again. So I've been asking myself: Why should we limit this smarter, more precise, better way to tackle diseases to the rich world? Now, don't misunderstand me \u2014 I'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like Herceptin to the developing world, although I'd actually kind of like that. What I am talking about is moving from this precise targeting for individuals to tackle public health problems in populations.Now, OK, I know probably you're thinking, \"She's crazy. You can't do that. That's too ambitious.\" But here's the thing: we're already doing this in a limited way, and it's already starting to make a big difference.So here's what's happening. Now, I told you I trained as a cancer doctor. But like many, many doctors who trained in San Francisco in the '80s, I also trained as an AIDS doctor. It was a terrible time. AIDS was a death sentence. All my patients died. Now, things are better, but HIV/AIDS remains a terrible global challenge. Worldwide, about 17 million women are living with HIV. We know that when these women become pregnant, they can transfer the virus to their baby. We also know in the absence of therapy, half those babies will not survive until the age of two. But we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee that she will not transmit the virus to the baby. So what do we do?Well, a one-size-fits-all approach, kind of like that blast of chemo, would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world. That would do the job. But it's just not practical. So instead, we target those areas where HIV rates are the highest. We know in certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest. This precision approach to a public health problem has cut by nearly half HIV transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years.(Applause)Screening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world is a powerful example of how precision public health can change things on a big scale.So ... How do we do that? We can do that because we know. We know who to target, what to target, where to target and how to target. And that, for me, are the important  elements of precision public health: who, what, where and how.But let's go back to the 2.6 million babies who die before they're one month old. Here's the problem: we just don't know. It may seem unbelievable, but the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality in those countries with the highest infant mortality is a conversation with mom. A health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child, \"Was the baby vomiting? Did they have a fever?\" And that conversation may take place as long as three months after the baby has died. Now, put yourself in the shoes of that mom. It's a heartbreaking, excruciating conversation. And even worse \u2014 it's not that helpful, because we might know there was a fever or vomiting, but we don't know why. So in the absence of knowing that knowledge, we cannot prevent that mom, that family, or other families in that community from suffering the same tragedy.But what if we applied a precision public health approach? Let's say, for example, we find out in certain areas of Africa that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection transferred from the mother to the baby, known as Group B streptococcus. In the absence of treatment, mom has a seven times higher chance that her next baby will die. Once we define the problem, we can prevent that death with something as cheap and safe as penicillin. We can do that because then we'll know. And that's the point: once we know, we can bring the right interventions to the right population in the right places to save lives.With this approach, and with these interventions and others like them, I have no doubt that a precision public health approach can help our world achieve our 15-year goal. And that would translate into a million babies' lives saved every single year. One million babies every single year.And why would we stop there? A much more powerful approach to public health \u2014 imagine what might be possible. Why couldn't we more effectively tackle malnutrition? Why wouldn't we prevent cervical cancer in women? And why not eradicate malaria?(Applause)Yes, clap for that!(Applause)So, you know, I live in two different worlds, one world populated by scientists, and another world populated by public health professionals. The promise of precision public health is to bring these two worlds together. But you know, we all live in two worlds: the rich world and the poor world. And what I'm most excited about about precision public health is bridging these two worlds. Every day in the rich world, we're bringing incredible talent and tools \u2014 everything at our disposal \u2014 to precisely target diseases in ways I never imagined would be possible. Surely, we can tap into that kind of talent and tools to stop babies dying in the poor world. If we did, then every parent would have the confidence to name their child the moment that child is born, daring to dream that that child's life will be measured in decades, not days.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2514, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.846\nOK, first, some introductions.\n\n00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:20.100\nMy mom, Jennie, took this picture.\n\n00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:23.455\nThat's my dad, Frank, in the middle.\n\n00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:26.241\nAnd on his left, my sisters:\n\n00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:30.749\nMary Catherine, Judith Ann,\nTheresa Marie.\n\n00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:34.697\nJohn Patrick's sitting on his lap\nand Kevin Michael's on his right.\n\n00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:38.170\nAnd in the pale-blue windbreaker,\n\n00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:40.339\nSusan Diane.

That's too ambitious.\"\n\n00:07:26.788 --> 00:07:28.290\nBut here's the thing:\n\n00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:32.436\nwe're already doing this in a limited way,\n\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.530\nand it's already starting\nto make a big difference.\n\n00:07:36.564 --> 00:07:38.093\nSo here's what's happening.\n\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.500\nNow, I told you I trained\nas a cancer doctor.\n\n00:07:41.524 --> 00:07:45.973\nBut like many, many doctors\nwho trained in San Francisco in the '80s,\n\n00:07:45.997 --> 00:07:48.088\nI also trained as an AIDS doctor.\n\n00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:50.643\nIt was a terrible time.\n\n00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:53.500\nAIDS was a death sentence.\n\n00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:55.969\nAll my patients died.\n\n00:07:57.287 --> 00:07:59.191\nNow, things are better,\n\n00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:03.794\nbut HIV/AIDS remains\na terrible global challenge.\n\n00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:09.882\nWorldwide, about 17 million women\nare living with HIV.\n\n00:08:10.702 --> 00:08:13.999\nWe know that when these women\nbecome pregnant,\n\n00:08:14.023 --> 00:08:16.636\nthey can transfer the virus to their baby.\n\n00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:20.761\nWe also know in the absence of therapy,\n\n00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:24.268\nhalf those babies will not survive\nuntil the age of two.\n\n00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:30.541\nBut we know that antiretroviral therapy\ncan virtually guarantee\n\n00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:33.516\nthat she will not transmit\nthe virus to the baby.\n\n00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:35.199\nSo what do we do?\n\n00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:40.228\nWell, a one-size-fits-all approach,\nkind of like that blast of chemo,\n\n00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:43.432\nwould mean we test and treat\nevery pregnant woman in the world.\n\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.291\nThat would do the job.\n\n00:08:45.847 --> 00:08:48.099\nBut it's just not practical.\n\n00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:54.821\nSo instead, we target those areas\nwhere HIV rates are the highest.\n\n00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:59.779\nWe know in certain countries\nin sub-Saharan Africa\n\n00:08:59.803 --> 00:09:03.965\nwe can test and treat pregnant women\nwhere rates are highest.\n\n00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:07.910\nThis precision approach\nto a public health problem\n\n00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:10.335\nhas cut by nearly half\n\n00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:13.114\nHIV transmission from mothers to baby\n\n00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:14.972\nin the last five years.\n\n00:09:15.443 --> 00:09:19.808\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:20.903 --> 00:09:25.965\nScreening pregnant women\nin certain areas in the developing world\n\n00:09:25.989 --> 00:09:29.093\nis a powerful example\n\n00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:34.632\nof how precision public health\ncan change things on a big scale.\n\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.561\nSo ...\n\n00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:39.348\nHow do we do that?\n\n00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:41.537\nWe can do that because we know.\n\n00:09:41.854 --> 00:09:44.172\nWe know who to target,\n\n00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:45.883\nwhat to target,\n\n00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:48.199\nwhere to target and how to target.\n\n00:09:48.643 --> 00:09:52.945\nAnd that, for me, are the important \nelements of precision public health:\n\n00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:56.026\nwho, what, where and how.\n\n00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:01.673\nBut let's go back\nto the 2.6 million babies\n\n00:10:01.697 --> 00:10:03.714\nwho die before they're one month old.\n\n00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:05.998\nHere's the problem: we just don't know.\n\n00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:09.175\nIt may seem unbelievable,\n\n00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:14.062\nbut the way we figure out\nthe causes of infant mortality\n\n00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:17.097\nin those countries\nwith the highest infant mortality\n\n00:10:17.121 --> 00:10:19.117\nis a conversation with mom.\n\n00:10:19.906 --> 00:10:24.284\nA health worker asks a mom\nwho has just lost her child,\n\n00:10:24.308 --> 00:10:27.977\n\"Was the baby vomiting?\nDid they have a fever?\"\n\n00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:29.950\nAnd that conversation may take place\n\n00:10:29.974 --> 00:10:33.885\nas long as three months\nafter the baby has died.\n\n00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:38.057\nNow, put yourself\nin the shoes of that mom.\n\n00:10:39.197 --> 00:10:43.153\nIt's a heartbreaking,\nexcruciating conversation.\n\n00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:46.720\nAnd even worse -- it's not that helpful,\n\n00:10:47.593 --> 00:10:50.546\nbecause we might know\nthere was a fever or vomiting,\n\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.283\nbut we don't know why.\n\n00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:56.611\nSo in the absence of knowing\nthat knowledge,\n\n00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:59.617\nwe cannot prevent that mom, that family,\n\n00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:01.739\nor other families in that community\n\n00:11:01.763 --> 00:11:03.711\nfrom suffering the same tragedy.\n\n00:11:04.762 --> 00:11:08.236\nBut what if we applied\na precision public health approach?\n\n00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:10.416\nLet's say, for example,\n\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.374\nwe find out in certain areas of Africa\n\n00:11:13.398 --> 00:11:17.144\nthat babies are dying\nbecause of a bacterial infection\n\n00:11:17.168 --> 00:11:19.715\ntransferred from the mother to the baby,\n\n00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:22.212\nknown as Group B streptococcus.\n\n00:11:22.957 -->

real harm of the global arms trade", "duration": "814", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/samantha_nutt_the_real_harm_of_the_global_arms_trade", "transcript": "Thank you very much. Good evening.Some of you may have noticed that my last name is Nutt. And if you did, you are forgiven for wondering how a Nutt managed to end up in a war zone. I actually was offered, right out of medical school, and accepted a volunteer contract to work with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia, that was worth one dollar. And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar in the event that the UN needed to issue an evacuation order, so that I would be covered. I was, after all, heading into one of the world's most dangerous places. And by now, some of you may be asking yourselves, and I just want to reassure you, that I did get half the money up front.(Laughter)But you see, this is how, with 50 cents in my pocket, I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia. Journalists called it the \"city of death.\" And they called it the city of death because 300,000 people had lost their lives there \u2014 300,000 people, mostly as a result of war-related famine and disease.I was part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out how best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe. It was right on the heels of the Rwandan genocide, and aid money to the region was drying up. Many aid organizations, unfortunately, had been forced to close their doors. And so the question that I was asked to specifically help answer, which is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over, is: What the hell do we do now? You know, the security environment in Somalia at that moment in time \u2014 and nothing has really changed too much \u2014 can best be described as \"Mad Max\" by way of \"A Clockwork Orange.\"And I remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival, I went up to a feeding clinic. There were dozens of women who were standing in line, and they were clutching their infants very close. About 20 minutes into this conversation I was having with this one young woman, I leaned forward and tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby's hand. And when I did this, I discovered that her baby was already in rigor. She was stiff, and her little, lifeless hand was curled into itself. She had died hours before of malnutrition and dehydration. I later learned that as her baby was dying, this young woman had been held for two days by some teenage boys who were armed with Kalashnikov rifles, and they were trying to shake her down for more money, money she very clearly did not have. And this is a scene that I have confronted in war zones the world over; places where kids, some as young as eight \u2014 they are this big \u2014 and those kids, they have never been to school. But they have fought and they have killed with automatic rifles.Is this just the way the world is? Some will you tell you that war is unavoidably human. After all, it is as old as existence itself. We say never again, and yet it happens again and again and again. But I will tell you that I have seen the absolute worst of what we as human beings are capable of doing to one another, and yet I still believe a different outcome is possible. Do you want to know why? Because over 20 years of doing this work, going in and out of war zones around the world, I have come to understand that there are aspects of this problem that we, all of us, as people occupying this shared space, that we can change \u2014 not through force or coercion or invasion, but by simply looking at all of the options available to us and choosing the ones that favor peace at the expense of war, instead of war at the expense of peace.How so? Well, I want you to consider this: there are at least 800 million small arms and light weapons in circulation in the world today. The vast majority of civilians, like that young baby, who are dying in war zones around the world, are dying at the hands of various armed groups who rely on a near-infinite supply of cheap, easy and efficient weapons to rape, threaten, intimidate and brutalize those civilians at every turn. How cheap? Well, in some parts of the world, you can buy an AK-47 for as little as 10 dollars. In many places in which I have worked, it is easier to get access to an automatic rifle than it is to get access to clean drinking water.And so now the important part: Can anything be done about this? To answer that question, let's take a look at this map of the world. And now, let's add in all of the countries that are currently at war, and the number of people who have either died or have been displaced as a result of that violence. It is a staggering number \u2014 more than 40 million people. But you will also notice something else about this map. You will notice that most of those countries are in the Global South. Now, let's look at the countries that are the world's top 20 exporters of small arms in the world. And what do we notice? Well, you see them in green. You will notice that those are mostly countries in the Global North, primarily Western countries. What does this tell us? This tells us that most of the people who are dying in war are living in poor countries, and yet most of the people who are profiting from war are living in rich countries \u2014 people like you and me.And then what if we go beyond small arms for a second. What if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world? Who does the biggest business? Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons come from none other than the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany. It's shocking, isn't it?Now, some of you might be saying at this moment in time, \"Oh yeah, but OK, hang on a second there ... Nutt.\"(Laughter)Grade school was spectacular for me. It was, really, a wonderful experience.(Laughter)But you might be saying to yourselves, You know, all of these weapons in war zones \u2014 they're not a cause, but an effect of the violence that plagues them each and every single day. You know, places like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order, promote peace and security, to combat terror groups \u2014 surely this is a good thing.Let's take a look at that assumption for just one moment, because you see there has been a boom in the small-arms trade since the start of the War on Terror. In fact, it is a business that has grown threefold over the past 15 years. And now let's compare that to the number of people who have directly died in armed conflict around the world in that same period. What do you notice? Well, you notice that, in fact, that also goes up roughly three- to fourfold. They basically go up and end at the same point.Now, we can have a circular argument here about whether this increase in fatalities is a response to the increase of small arms, or the other way around. But here's what we should really take away from this. What we should take away from this is that this is a relationship worth scrutinizing, especially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to Iraq for use by the Iraqi Army, or to Syria for so-called moderate opposition fighters, that those arms, many of them, are now in the hands of ISIS; or when you consider that arms that were shipped to Libya are now actively drifting across the Sahel, and ending up with groups like Boko Haram and al Qaeda and other militant groups.And therein lies the problem. Because, you see, small arms anywhere are a menace everywhere, because their first stop is rarely their last.Spending on war per person per year now amounts to about 249 dollars \u2014 249 dollars per person, which is roughly 12 times what we spend on foreign aid, money that is used to educate and vaccinate children and combat malnutrition in the Global South. But we can shift that balance. How do we do this? Well, it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand, so we can tackle it from both sides.On the supply side, we can push our governments to adopt international arms transparency mechanisms like the Arms Trade Treaty, which makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable for where their arms are going and what their arms might be used for. Here in the United States, the largest arms-exporting country in the world by far, President Obama has rightly signed the Arms Trade Treaty, but none of it takes effect, it isn't binding, until it is approved and ratified by the Senate. This is where we need to make our voices heard. You know, the curbing of small arms \u2014 it's not going to solve the problem of war. Increased control mechanisms won't solve that problem. But it's an important step in the right direction. And it's up to all of us who live in those rich countries to make change here.What about on the demand side? You know, there are generations around the world who are being lost to war. It is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence with investments in education, in strengthening the rule of law and in economic development, especially for women. I have personally seen just how incredibly powerful those kinds of efforts can be around the world.But here's the thing: they take time, which means for you as individuals, if you want to give, please, by all means do it. But know that how you give is just as important as how much you give. Regular contributions like monthly contributions are a far more effective way of giving, because they allow humanitarian organizations to properly plan and be invested over the long term, and to be present in the lives of families who have been affected by war, wars that many of us, frankly, all too quickly forget.When I first got on that plane for Somalia as a young doctor, I had no idea what it meant to live with war. But I can tell you that I know what it means now. And I know what it means to lie in bed in the pitch-black night and listen to that haunting \"pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!\" of automatic gunfire, and wonder with absolute dread how many minutes I have left until it will be right on top of me. I can tell you that it is a terrifying and agonizing fear, one that millions of people around the world are forced to confront each and every single day, especially children. Over the years of doing this work, unfortunately, war has killed far too many people close to me. And on at least a couple of occasions, war has very nearly killed me as well.But I firmly believe, which is why I get up and do what I do every single day, that we can make different choices here. Because you see, war is ours, as human beings. We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it. We are therefore not powerless to solve it. On the contrary, we are the only ones who can.Thank you very much, and I want to wish you the greatest success.(Applause)", "id": 2515, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:14.316\nThank you very much.

hands\nof various armed groups\n\n00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:09.997\nwho rely on a near-infinite supply\nof cheap, easy and efficient weapons\n\n00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:14.681\nto rape, threaten, intimidate\nand brutalize those civilians\n\n00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:16.109\nat every turn.\n\n00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.046\nHow cheap?\n\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.686\nWell, in some parts of the world,\n\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.108\nyou can buy an AK-47\nfor as little as 10 dollars.\n\n00:05:24.132 --> 00:05:26.988\nIn many places in which I have worked,\n\n00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:32.076\nit is easier to get access\nto an automatic rifle\n\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.221\nthan it is to get access\nto clean drinking water.\n\n00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:38.594\nAnd so now the important part:\n\n00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:42.776\nCan anything be done about this?\n\n00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.760\nTo answer that question,\n\n00:05:45.784 --> 00:05:47.794\nlet's take a look\nat this map of the world.\n\n00:05:48.204 --> 00:05:52.588\nAnd now, let's add in all of the countries\nthat are currently at war,\n\n00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:55.558\nand the number of people\nwho have either died\n\n00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:58.050\nor have been displaced\nas a result of that violence.\n\n00:05:58.074 --> 00:05:59.470\nIt is a staggering number --\n\n00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:02.191\nmore than 40 million people.\n\n00:06:02.722 --> 00:06:05.389\nBut you will also notice\nsomething else about this map.\n\n00:06:05.413 --> 00:06:07.533\nYou will notice\nthat most of those countries\n\n00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:08.911\nare in the Global South.\n\n00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.701\nNow, let's look at the countries\n\n00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:16.580\nthat are the world's top 20 exporters\nof small arms in the world.\n\n00:06:17.517 --> 00:06:18.759\nAnd what do we notice?\n\n00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.752\nWell, you see them in green.\n\n00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:24.666\nYou will notice that those are mostly\ncountries in the Global North,\n\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.388\nprimarily Western countries.\n\n00:06:26.412 --> 00:06:27.628\nWhat does this tell us?\n\n00:06:27.652 --> 00:06:31.143\nThis tells us that most of the people\nwho are dying in war\n\n00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:33.070\nare living in poor countries,\n\n00:06:33.094 --> 00:06:35.908\nand yet most of the people\nwho are profiting from war\n\n00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:40.929\nare living in rich countries --\npeople like you and me.\n\n00:06:41.762 --> 00:06:44.564\nAnd then what if we go\nbeyond small arms for a second.\n\n00:06:44.588 --> 00:06:47.812\nWhat if we look at all weapons\nin circulation in the world?\n\n00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:49.620\nWho does the biggest business?\n\n00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:52.119\nWell, roughly 80 percent of those weapons\n\n00:06:52.143 --> 00:06:55.685\ncome from none other\nthan the five permanent members\n\n00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:57.600\nof the United Nations Security Council,\n\n00:06:57.624 --> 00:06:59.052\nplus Germany.\n\n00:06:59.727 --> 00:07:01.005\nIt's shocking, isn't it?\n\n00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:04.149\nNow, some of you might be saying\nat this moment in time,\n\n00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:07.424\n\"Oh yeah, but OK,\nhang on a second there ... Nutt.\"\n\n00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:09.653\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:12.038\nGrade school was spectacular for me.\n\n00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:14.006\nIt was, really, a wonderful experience.\n\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.984\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:17.378 --> 00:07:19.220\nBut you might be saying to yourselves,\n\n00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:22.592\nYou know, all of these weapons\nin war zones -- they're not a cause,\n\n00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:25.038\nbut an effect of the violence\nthat plagues them\n\n00:07:25.062 --> 00:07:26.546\neach and every single day.\n\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.753\nYou know, places like Iraq\nand Afghanistan,\n\n00:07:28.777 --> 00:07:32.191\nwhere they need these weapons\nto be able to maintain law and order,\n\n00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:35.836\npromote peace and security,\nto combat terror groups --\n\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.355\nsurely this is a good thing.\n\n00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:41.419\nLet's take a look at that assumption\nfor just one moment,\n\n00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:45.229\nbecause you see there has been\na boom in the small-arms trade\n\n00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:47.037\nsince the start of the War on Terror.\n\n00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:50.259\nIn fact, it is a business\nthat has grown threefold\n\n00:07:50.283 --> 00:07:52.226\nover the past 15 years.\n\n00:07:52.646 --> 00:07:56.203\nAnd now let's compare that\nto the number of people\n\n00:07:56.227 --> 00:08:00.053\nwho have directly died\nin armed conflict around the world\n\n00:08:00.077 --> 00:08:01.252\nin that same period.\n\n00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:03.030\nWhat do you notice?\n\n00:08:03.054 --> 00:08:05.411\nWell, you notice that, in fact,\nthat also goes up\n\n00:08:05.435 --> 00:08:07.046\nroughly three- to fourfold.\n\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.735\nThey basically go up\nand end at the same point.\n\n00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:14.038\nNow, we can have a circular argument here\n\n00:08:14.062 --> 00:08:18.134\nabout whether this increase\nin fatalities is a response\n\n00:08:18.158 --> 00:08:22.067\nto the increase of small arms,\nor the other way around.\n\n00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:24.587\nBut here's what we should\nreally take away from this.\n\n00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:26.271\nWhat we should take away from this\n\n00:08:26.295 --> 00:08:30.713\nis that this is a relationship\nworth scrutinizing,\n\n00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:36.271\nespecially when you consider\nthat small arms that were shipped to Iraq\n\n00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:38.089\nfor use by the Iraqi Army,\n\n00:08:38.113 --> 00:08:41.360\nor to Syria for so-called\nmoderate opposition fighters,\n\n00:08:41.384 --> 00:08:45.577\nthat those arms, many of them,\nare now in the hands of ISIS;\n\n00:08:46.054 --> 00:08:48.794\nor when you consider that arms\nthat were shipped to Libya\n\n00:08:48.818 --> 00:08:51.531\nare now actively drifting\nacross the Sahel,\n\n00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:56.298\nand ending up with groups\nlike Boko Haram and al Qaeda\n\n00:08:56.322 --> 00:08:59.027\nand other militant groups.\n\n00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:01.742\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\n00:09:02.424 --> 00:09:03.576\nBecause, you see,\n\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.119\nsmall arms anywhere\nare a menace everywhere,\n\n00:09:09.789 --> 00:09:14.132\nbecause their first stop\nis rarely their last.\n\n00:09:14.862 --> 00:09:17.278\nSpending on war per person per year\n\n00:09:17.302 --> 00:09:21.347\nnow amounts to about 249 dollars --\n\n00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:23.772\n249 dollars per person,\n\n00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:28.735\nwhich is roughly 12 times\nwhat we spend on foreign aid,\n\n00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:32.196\nmoney that is used to educate\nand vaccinate children\n\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.083\nand combat malnutrition\nin the Global South.\n\n00:09:35.772 --> 00:09:39.069\nBut we can shift that balance.\n\n00:09:39.562 --> 00:09:40.713\nHow do we do this?\n\n00:09:40.737 --> 00:09:43.579\nWell, it is essentially a problem\nof both supply and demand,\n\n00:09:43.603 --> 00:09:45.546\nso we can tackle it from both sides.\n\n00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:47.621\nOn the supply side,\n\n00:09:47.645 --> 00:09:50.819\nwe can push our governments\n\n00:09:50.843 --> 00:09:53.906\nto adopt international arms\ntransparency mechanisms\n\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.731\nlike the Arms Trade Treaty,\n\n00:09:55.755 --> 00:09:59.522\nwhich makes it so that rich countries\nhave to be more accountable\n\n00:09:59.546 --> 00:10:01.221\nfor where their arms are going\n\n00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:03.644\nand what their arms might be used for.\n\n00:10:03.668 --> 00:10:04.933\nHere in the United States,\n\n00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:09.574\nthe largest arms-exporting country\nin the world by far,\n\n00:10:09.598 --> 00:10:13.523\nPresident Obama has rightly signed\nthe Arms Trade Treaty,\n\n00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:16.108\nbut none of it takes effect,\nit isn't binding,\n\n00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:19.641\nuntil it is approved\nand ratified by the Senate.\n\n00:10:20.823 --> 00:10:23.777\nThis is where we need\nto make our voices heard.\n\n00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:27.515\nYou know, the curbing of small arms --\n\n00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:30.341\nit's not going to solve\nthe problem of war.\n\n00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:33.647\nIncreased control mechanisms\nwon't solve that problem.\n\n00:10:33.671 --> 00:10:36.918\nBut it's an important step\nin the right direction.\n\n00:10:36.942 --> 00:10:39.815\nAnd it's up to all of us\nwho live in those rich countries\n\n00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.649\nto make change here.\n\n00:10:41.952 --> 00:10:45.161\nWhat about on the demand side?\n\n00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:47.938\nYou know, there are generations\naround the world\n\n00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:50.018\nwho are being lost to war.\n\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.151\nIt is possible to disrupt\nthat cycle of violence\n\n00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:58.168\nwith investments in education,\nin strengthening the rule of law\n\n00:10:58.192 --> 00:11:00.573\nand in economic development,\nespecially for women.\n\n00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:02.225\nI have personally seen\n\n00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:05.290\njust how incredibly powerful\nthose kinds of efforts can be\n\n00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:06.648\naround the world.\n\n00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:08.792\nBut here's the thing:\n\n00:11:08.816 --> 00:11:10.224\nthey take time,\n\n00:11:10.248 --> 00:11:14.287\nwhich means for you as individuals,\nif you want to give,\n\n00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:16.018\nplease, by all means do it.\n\n00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:19.605\nBut know that how you give\nis just as important\n\n00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:21.636\nas how much you give.\n\n00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:24.550\nRegular contributions\nlike monthly contributions\n\n00:11:24.574 --> 00:11:27.862\nare a far more effective way of giving,\n\n00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:30.599\nbecause they allow\nhumanitarian organizations\n\n00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:34.948\nto properly plan and be invested\nover the long term,\n\n00:11:34.972 --> 00:11:40.597\nand to be present in the lives of families\nwho have been affected by war,\n\n00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:44.857\nwars that many of us, frankly,\nall too quickly forget.\n\n00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:51.257\nWhen I first got on that plane\nfor Somalia as a young doctor,\n\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.197\nI had no idea what it meant\nto live with war.\n\n00:11:57.477 --> 00:11:59.879\nBut I can tell you that I know\nwhat it means now.\n\n00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:02.939\nAnd I know what it means\n\n00:12:03.487 --> 00:12:07.662\nto lie in bed in the pitch-black night\n\n00:12:08.642 --> 00:12:12.285\nand listen to that haunting\n\"pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!\"\n\n00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:14.872\nof automatic gunfire,\n\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.383\nand wonder with absolute dread\n\n00:12:19.256 --> 00:12:22.843\nhow many minutes I have left\nuntil it will be right on top of me.\n\n00:12:23.514 --> 00:12:28.551\nI can tell you that it is a terrifying\nand agonizing fear,\n\n00:12:28.575 --> 00:12:32.932\none that millions of people\naround the world are forced to confront\n\n00:12:32.956 --> 00:12:35.122\neach and every single day,\n\n00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:36.479\nespecially children.\n\n00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:40.115\nOver the years of doing this work,\n\n00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:45.251\nunfortunately, war has killed\nfar too many people close to me.\n\n00:12:46.235 --> 00:12:49.211\nAnd on at least a couple of occasions,\n\n00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:52.005\nwar has very nearly killed me as well.\n\n00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:58.141\nBut I firmly believe,\n\n00:12:58.165 --> 00:13:00.942\nwhich is why I get up and do\nwhat I do every single day,\n\n00:13:01.744 --> 00:13:04.472\nthat we can make different choices here.\n\n00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:08.061\nBecause you see, war is ours,\n\n00:13:08.085 --> 00:13:09.664\nas human beings.\n\n00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:13.300\nWe buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.\n\n00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:17.617\nWe are therefore\nnot powerless to solve it.\n\n00:13:18.527 --> 00:13:20.198\nOn the contrary,\n\n00:13:20.222 --> 00:13:23.173\nwe are the only ones who can.\n\n00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:26.799\nThank you very much, and I want\nto wish you the greatest success.\n\n00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:33.697\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "An entertainment icon on living a life of meaning", "duration": "1186", "url":

audience is global, it's diverse, so I've been tasked with starting with his bio, which could easily take up the entire 18 minutes. So instead we're going to do 93 years in 93 seconds or less.(Laughter)You were born in New Hampshire.Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.EH: New Haven, Connecticut.(Laughter)NL: There goes seven more seconds.EH: Nailed it.(Laughter)You were born in New Haven, Connecticut. Your father was a con man \u2014 I got that right. He was taken away to prison when you were nine years old. You flew 52 missions as a fighter pilot in World War II. You came back to \u2014NL: Radio operator.EH: You came to LA to break into Hollywood, first in publicity, then in TV. You had no training as a writer, formally, but you hustled your way in. Your breakthrough, your debut, was a little show called \"All in the Family.\" You followed that up with a string of hits that to this day is unmatched in Hollywood: \"Sanford and Son,\" \"Maude,\" \"Good Times,\" \"The Jeffersons,\" \"One Day at a Time,\" \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,\" to name literally a fraction of them. Not only are they all commercially \u2014(Applause)Not only are they all commercially successful, but many of them push our culture forward by giving the underrepresented members of society their first prime-time voice. You have seven shows in the top 10 at one time. At one point, you aggregate an audience of 120 million people per week watching your content. That's more than the audience for Super Bowl 50, which happens once a year.NL: Holy shit.(Laughter)(Applause)EH: And we're not even to the holy shit part.(Laughter)You land yourself on Richard Nixon's enemies list \u2014 he had one.That's an applause line, too.(Applause)You're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame on the first day that it exists. Then came the movies. \"Fried Green Tomatoes,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"Stand By Me,\" \"This Is Spinal Tap.\"(Applause)Again, just to name a fraction.(Applause)Then you wipe the slate clean, start a third act as a political activist focusing on protecting the First Amendment and the separation of church and state. You start People For The American Way. You buy the Declaration of Independence and give it back to the people. You stay active in both entertainment and politics until the ripe old of age of 93, when you write a book and make a documentary about your life story. And after all that, they finally think you're ready for a TED Talk.(Laughter)(Applause)NL: I love being here. And I love you for agreeing to do this.EH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor. So here's my first question. Was your mother proud of you?(Laughter)NL: My mother ... what a place to start. Let me put it this way \u2014 when I came back from the war, she showed me the letters that I had written her from overseas, and they were absolute love letters.(Laughter)This really sums up my mother. They were love letters, as if I had written them to \u2014 they were love letters. A year later I asked my mother if I could have them, because I'd like to keep them all the years of my life ... She had thrown them away.(Laughter)That's my mother.(Laughter)The best way I can sum it up in more recent times is \u2014 this is also more recent times \u2014 a number of years ago, when they started the Hall of Fame to which you referred. It was a Sunday morning, when I got a call from the fellow who ran the TV Academy of Arts & Sciences. He was calling me to tell me they had met all day yesterday and he was confidentially telling me they were going to start a hall of fame and these were the inductees. I started to say \"Richard Nixon,\" because Richard Nixon \u2014EH: I don't think he was on their list.NL: William Paley, who started CBS, David Sarnoff, who started NBC, Edward R. Murrow, the greatest of the foreign correspondents, Paddy Chayefsky \u2014 I think the best writer that ever came out of television \u2014 Milton Berle, Lucille Ball and me.EH: Not bad.NL: I call my mother immediately in Hartford, Connecticut. \"Mom, this is what's happened, they're starting a hall of fame.\"I tell her the list of names and me, and she says, \"Listen, if that's what they want to do, who am I to say?\"(Laughter)(Applause)That's my Ma. I think it earns that kind of a laugh because everybody has a piece of that mother.(Laughter)EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother is born, right there.So your father also played a large role in your life, mostly by his absence.NL: Yeah.EH: Tell us what happened when you were nine years old.NL: He was flying to Oklahoma with three guys that my mother said, \"I don't want you to have anything to do with them, I don't trust those men.\" That's when I heard, maybe not for the first time, \"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going.\" And he went. It turns out he was picking up some fake bonds, which he was flying across the country to sell. But the fact that he was going to Oklahoma in a plane, and he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat, just like Ken Maynard, my favorite cowboy wore. You know, this was a few years after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic. I mean, it was exotic that my father was going there. But when he came back, they arrested him as he got off the plane.That night newspapers were all over the house, my father was with his hat in front of his face, manacled to a detective. And my mother was selling the furniture, because we were leaving \u2014 she didn't want to stay in that state of shame, in Chelsea, Massachusetts. And selling the furniture \u2014 the house was loaded with people.And in the middle of all of that, some strange horse's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said, \"Well, you're the man of the house now.\" I'm crying, and this asshole says, \"You're the man of the house now.\" And I think that was the moment I began to understand the foolishness of the human condition. So ... it took a lot of years to look back at it and feel it was a benefit. But \u2014EH: It's interesting you call it a benefit.NL: Benefit in that it gave me that springboard. I mean that I could think how foolish it was to say to this crying nine-year-old boy, \"You're the man of the house now.\" And then I was crying, and then he said, \"And men of the house don't cry.\" And I ...(Laughter)So ... I look back, and I think that's when I learned the foolishness of the human condition, and it's been that gift that I've used.EH: So you have a father who's absent, you have a mother for whom apparently nothing is good enough. Do you think that starting out as a kid who maybe never felt heard started you down a journey that ended with you being an adult with a weekly audience of 120 million people?NL: I love the way you put that question, because I guess I've spent my life wanting \u2014 if anything, wanting to be heard. I think \u2014 It's a simple answer, yes, that was what sparked \u2014 well, there were other things, too. When my father was away, I was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together, and I caught a signal that turned out to be Father Coughlin.(Laughter)Yeah, somebody laughed.(Laughter)But not funny, this was a horse's \u2014 another horse's ass \u2014 who was very vocal about hating the New Deal and Roosevelt and Jews. The first time I ran into an understanding that there were people in this world that hated me because I was born to Jewish parents. And that had an enormous effect on my life.EH: So you had a childhood with little in the way of strong male role models, except for your grandfather. Tell us about him.NL: Oh, my grandfather. Well here's the way I always talked about that grandfather. There were parades, lots of parades when I was a kid. There were parades on Veteran's Day \u2014 there wasn't a President's Day. There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday, George Washington's birthday and Flag Day ... And lots of little parades. My grandfather used to take me and we'd stand on the street corner, he'd hold my hand, and I'd look up and I'd see a tear running down his eye. And he meant a great deal to me.And he used to write presidents of the United States. Every letter started, \"My dearest, darling Mr. President,\" and he'd tell him something wonderful about what he did. But when he disagreed with the President, he also wrote, \"My dearest, darling Mr. President, Didn't I tell you last week ...?\"(Laughter)And I would run down the stairs every now and then and pick up the mail. We were three flights up, 74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut. And I'd pick up a little white envelope reading, \"Shya C. called at this address.\" And that's the story I have told about my grandfather \u2014EH: They wrote him back on the envelopes \u2014NL: They wrote back. But I have shown them myself, going way back to Phil Donahue and others before him, literally dozens of interviews in which I told that story. This will be the second time I have said the whole story was a lie. The truth was my grandfather took me to parades, we had lots of those. The truth is a tear came down his eye.The truth is he would write an occasional letter, and I did pick up those little envelopes. But \"My dearest darling Mr. President,\" all the rest of it, is a story I borrowed from a good friend whose grandfather was that grandfather who wrote those letters. And, I mean, I stole Arthur Marshall's grandfather and made him my own. Always.When I started to write my memoir \u2014 \"Even this \u2014\" How about that? \"Even This I Get to Experience.\" When I started to write the memoir and I started to think about it, and then I \u2014 I \u2014 I did a reasonable amount of crying, and I realized how much I needed the father. So much so that I appropriated Arthur Marshall's grandfather. So much so, the word \"father\" \u2014 I have six kids by the way. My favorite role in life. It and husband to my wife Lyn. But I stole the man's identity because I needed the father.Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit and come out on the other side, and I forgive my father \u2014 the best thing I \u2014 the worst thing I \u2014 The word I'd like to use about him and think about him is \u2014 he was a rascal. The fact that he lied and stole and cheated and went to prison ... I submerge that in the word \"rascal.\"EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal.NL: I'm a pro.EH: You're a pro.(Laughter)And that quote is widely attributed to John Lennon, but it turns out he stole it from T.S. Eliot. So you're in good company.(Laughter)EH: I want to talk about your work. Obviously the impact of your work has been written about and I'm sure you've heard about it all your life: what it meant to people, what it meant to our culture, you heard the applause when I just named the names of the shows, you raised half the people in the room through your work. But have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work that surprised you?NL: Oh, god \u2014 surprised me and delighted me from head to toe. There was \"An Evening with Norman Lear\" within the last year that a group of hip-hop impresarios, performers and the Academy put together. The subtext of \"An Evening with ...\" was: What do a 92-year-old Jew \u2014 then 92 \u2014 and the world of hip-hop have in common? Russell Simmons was among seven on the stage. And when he talked about the shows, he wasn't talking about the Hollywood, George Jefferson in \"The Jeffersons,\" or the show that was a number five show. He was talking about a simple thing that made a big \u2014EH: Impact on him?NL: An impact on him \u2014 I was hesitating over the word, \"change.\" It's hard for me to imagine, you know, changing somebody's life, but that's the way he put it. He saw George Jefferson write a check on \"The Jeffersons,\" and he never knew that a black man could write a check. And he says it just impacted his life so \u2014 it changed his life.And when I hear things like that \u2014 little things \u2014 because I know that there isn't anybody in this audience that wasn't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody, whether it's as little as a smile or an unexpected \"Hello,\" that's how little this thing was. It could have been the dresser of the set who put the checkbook on the thing, and George had nothing to do while he was speaking, so he wrote it, I don't know. But \u2014EH: So in addition to the long list I shared in the beginning, I should have also mentioned that you invented hip-hop.(Laughter)NL: Well ...EH: I want to talk about \u2014NL: Well, then do it.(Laughter)EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment, but you've also built a life of meaning. And all of us strive to do both of those things \u2014 not all of us manage to. But even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those, very rarely do we figure out how to do them together. You managed to push culture forward through your art while also achieving world-beating commercial success. How did you do both?NL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished. This planet is one of a billion, they tell us, in a universe of which there are billions \u2014 billions of universes, billions of planets ... which we're trying to save and it requires saving. But ... anything I may have accomplished is \u2014 my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in Newington, Connecticut. And I said, \"Write your alderman or your mayor or something.\" She said, \"Well I'm not Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear.\" And that was the first time I said what I'm saying, I said, \"Claire. With everything you think about what I may have done and everything you've done,\" \u2014 she never left Newington \u2014 \"can you get your fingers close enough when you consider the size of the planet and so forth, to measure anything I may have done to anything you may have done?\"So ... I am convinced we're all responsible for doing as much as I may have accomplished. And I understand what you're saying \u2014EH: It's an articulate deflection \u2014NL: But you have to really buy into the size and scope of the creator's enterprise, here.EH: But here on this planet you have really mattered.NL: I'm a son of a gun.(Laughter)EH: So I have one more question for you. How old do you feel?NL: I am the peer of whoever I'm talking to.EH: Well, I feel 93.(Applause)NL: We out of here?EH: Well, I feel 93 years old, but I hope to one day feel as young as the person I'm sitting across from.Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Norman Lear.(Applause)NL: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2516, "subtitle":

Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment frozen within a fraction of time. Each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes. But what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph? What if a photograph could actually collapse time, compressing the best moments of the day and the night seamlessly into one single image?I've created a concept called \"Day to Night\" and I believe it's going to change the way you look at the world. I know it has for me.My process begins by photographing iconic locations, places that are part of what I call our collective memory. I photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move. I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes. Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and shooting over 1,500 images, I then choose the best moments of the day and night.Using time as a guide, I seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph, visualizing our conscious journey with time. I can take you to Paris for a view from the Tournelle Bridge. And I can show you the early morning rowers along the River Seine. And simultaneously, I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night. And in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air, and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day.Day to Night is a global project, and my work has always been about history. I'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice and actually seeing it during a specific event. And I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata, an event that's actually been taking place since 1498. The boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then. And an important element that I really want you guys to understand is: this is not a timelapse, this is me photographing throughout the day and the night. I am a relentless collector of magical moments. And the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.The entire concept came about in 1996. LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet. I got to the set and realized: it's a square. So the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage of 250 single images. So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing. And as I pan my camera to the right, I noticed there was a mirror on the wall and I saw they were actually reflecting in it. And for that one moment, that one image I asked them, \"Would you guys just kiss for this one picture?\" And then I came back to my studio in New York, and I hand-glued these 250 images together and stood back and went, \"Wow, this is so cool! I'm changing time in a photograph.\" And that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years until technology finally has caught up to my dreams.This is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night. And I'm going to show you a little video that gives you an idea of what it's like being with me when I do these pictures. To start with, you have to understand that to get views like this, most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker or a crane. So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop capturing the entire day unfold.One of the things that's great is I love to people-watch. And trust me when I tell you, this is the greatest seat in the house to have.But this is really how I go about creating these photographs. So once I decide on my view and the location, I have to decide where day begins and night ends. And that's what I call the time vector. Einstein described time as a fabric. Think of the surface of a trampoline: it warps and stretches with gravity. I see time as a fabric as well, except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.One of the unique aspects of this work is also, if you look at all my pictures, the time vector changes: sometimes I'll go left to right, sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally. I am exploring the space-time continuum within a two-dimensional still photograph.Now when I do these pictures, it's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind. I build a photograph based on time, and this is what I call the master plate. This can take us several months to complete. The fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs. So I never know who's going to be in the picture, if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset \u2014 no control. It's at the end of the process, if I've had a really great day and everything remained the same, that I then decide who's in and who's out, and it's all based on time. I'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing and they get seamlessly blended into the master plate. I'm compressing the day and night as I saw it, creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.Painting has always been a really important influence in all my work and I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt, the great Hudson River School painter. He inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks. This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley. So this is the photograph I created of Yosemite. This is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic. I photographed for over 30 hours in this picture. I was literally on the side of a cliff, capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions, the moonlight lighting El Capitan. And I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape. The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed \u2014 from day into night.And on a personal note, I actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket. And when that sun started to rise in the valley, I started to literally shake with excitement because I looked at the painting and I go, \"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting 100 years earlier.\"Day to Night is about all the things, it's like a compilation of all the things I love about the medium of photography. It's about landscape, it's about street photography, it's about color, it's about architecture, perspective, scale \u2014 and, especially, history.This is one of the most historical moments I've been able to photograph, the 2013 Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama. And if you look closely in this picture, you can actually see time changing in those large television sets. You can see Michelle waiting with the children, the president now greets the crowd, he takes his oath, and now he's speaking to the people. There's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this. For this particular photograph, I was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air and it was not very stable. So every time my assistant and I shifted our weight, our horizon line shifted. So for every picture you see, and there were about 1,800 in this picture, we both had to tape our feet into position every time I clicked the shutter. (Applause)I've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work. I think the two most important are patience and the power of observation. When you photograph a city like New York from above, I discovered that those people in cars that I sort of live with everyday, they don't look like people in cars anymore. They feel like a giant school of fish, it was a form of emergent behavior. And when people describe the energy of New York, I think this photograph begins to really capture that. When you look closer in my work, you can see there's stories going on. You realize that Times Square is a canyon, it's shadow and it's sunlight. So I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time. So wherever the shadows are, it's night and wherever the sun is, it's actually day.Time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around. But in a very unique and special way, I believe these photographs begin to put a face on time. They embody a new metaphysical visual reality. When you spend 15 hours looking at a place, you're going to see things a little differently than if you or I walked up with our camera, took a picture, and then walked away.This was a perfect example. I call it \"Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Selfie.\" I watched over 15 hours all these people not even look at Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. They were more interested in using it as a backdrop. They would walk up, take a picture, and then walk away. And I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example, a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is versus what the human experience is evolving into. The act of sharing has suddenly become more important than the experience itself. (Applause)And finally, my most recent image, which has such a special meaning for me personally: this is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. And this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera, this is not a reserve. I went specifically during the peak migration to hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals. Unfortunately, when we got there, there was a drought going on during the peak migration, a five-week drought. So all the animals were drawn to the water. I found this one watering hole, and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving, I had a real opportunity to capture something unique.We spent three days studying it, and nothing could have prepared me for what I witnessed during our shoot day. I photographed for 26 hours in a sealed crocodile blind, 18 feet in the air. What I witnessed was unimaginable. Frankly, it was Biblical. We saw, for 26 hours, all these competitive species share a single resource called water. The same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next 50 years. The animals never even grunted at each other. They seem to understand something that we humans don't. That this precious resource called water is something we all have to share.When I created this picture, I realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing, compressing time, exploring the space-time continuum within a photograph.As technology evolves along with photography, photographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory, but they will compose a new narrative of untold stories, creating a timeless window into our world.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2517, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.164 -->

the day and the night.\n\n00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.445\nI am a relentless collector\nof magical moments.\n\n00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:44.504\nAnd the thing that drives me\nis the fear of just missing one of them.\n\n00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:52.827\nThe entire concept came about in 1996.\n\n00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:57.076\nLIFE Magazine commissioned me\nto create a panoramic photograph\n\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.755\nof the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's\nfilm Romeo + Juliet.\n\n00:03:02.668 --> 00:03:06.045\nI got to the set and realized:\nit's a square.\n\n00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.467\nSo the only way I could actually create\na panoramic was to shoot a collage\n\n00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:12.830\nof 250 single images.\n\n00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.907\nSo I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes\nembracing.\n\n00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.721\nAnd as I pan my camera to the right,\n\n00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.343\nI noticed there was a mirror on the wall\n\n00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:24.782\nand I saw they were\nactually reflecting in it.\n\n00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:26.736\nAnd for that one moment, that one image\n\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.626\nI asked them, \"Would you guys just kiss\n\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.019\nfor this one picture?\"\n\n00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.834\nAnd then I came back\nto my studio in New York,\n\n00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:36.779\nand I hand-glued these 250 images together\n\n00:03:36.803 --> 00:03:39.628\nand stood back and went,\n\"Wow, this is so cool!\n\n00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.009\nI'm changing time in a photograph.\"\n\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.570\nAnd that concept actually\nstayed with me for 13 years\n\n00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:50.577\nuntil technology finally\nhas caught up to my dreams.\n\n00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.462\nThis is an image I created\nof the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.\n\n00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:56.767\nAnd I'm going to show you a little video\n\n00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:59.344\nthat gives you an idea of what\nit's like being with me\n\n00:03:59.368 --> 00:04:01.264\nwhen I do these pictures.\n\n00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:04.724\nTo start with, you have to understand\nthat to get views like this,\n\n00:04:04.748 --> 00:04:08.477\nmost of my time is spent up high,\nand I'm usually in a cherry picker\n\n00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:09.652\nor a crane.\n\n00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:13.068\nSo this is a typical day,\n12-18 hours, non-stop\n\n00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:15.254\ncapturing the entire day unfold.\n\n00:04:16.248 --> 00:04:19.224\nOne of the things that's great\nis I love to people-watch.\n\n00:04:19.248 --> 00:04:20.661\nAnd trust me when I tell you,\n\n00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:22.883\nthis is the greatest seat\nin the house to have.\n\n00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:27.288\nBut this is really how I go about\ncreating these photographs.\n\n00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:31.455\nSo once I decide on my view\nand the location,\n\n00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.638\nI have to decide where day begins\nand night ends.\n\n00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:36.804\nAnd that's what I call the time vector.\n\n00:04:37.434 --> 00:04:40.717\nEinstein described time as a fabric.\n\n00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:43.593\nThink of the surface of a trampoline:\n\n00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.204\nit warps and stretches with gravity.\n\n00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:49.676\nI see time as a fabric as well,\n\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.029\nexcept I take that fabric and flatten it,\ncompress it into single plane.\n\n00:04:55.053 --> 00:04:57.252\nOne of the unique aspects\nof this work is also,\n\n00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:58.776\nif you look at all my pictures,\n\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.310\nthe time vector changes:\n\n00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.020\nsometimes I'll go left to right,\n\n00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:06.072\nsometimes front to back,\nup or down, even diagonally.\n\n00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:09.944\nI am exploring the space-time continuum\n\n00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:12.207\nwithin a two-dimensional still photograph.\n\n00:05:13.072 --> 00:05:14.976\nNow when I do these pictures,\n\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.952\nit's literally like a real-time puzzle\ngoing on in my mind.\n\n00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:21.366\nI build a photograph based on time,\n\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.413\nand this is what I call the master plate.\n\n00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:26.485\nThis can take us several\nmonths to complete.\n\n00:05:27.084 --> 00:05:29.383\nThe fun thing about this work is\n\n00:05:29.407 --> 00:05:32.737\nI have absolutely zero control\nwhen I get up there\n\n00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:35.152\non any given day and capture photographs.\n\n00:05:35.176 --> 00:05:37.470\nSo I never know who's\ngoing to be in the picture,\n\n00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:40.477\nif it's going to be a great\nsunrise or sunset -- no control.\n\n00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:42.319\nIt's at the end of the process,\n\n00:05:42.343 --> 00:05:45.351\nif I've had a really great day\nand everything remained the same,\n\n00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.984\nthat I then decide who's in and who's out,\n\n00:05:48.008 --> 00:05:49.743\nand it's all based on time.\n\n00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:53.190\nI'll take those best moments that I pick\nover a month of editing\n\n00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:56.856\nand they get seamlessly blended\ninto the master plate.\n\n00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:00.421\nI'm compressing the day and night\n\n00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:01.595\nas I saw it,\n\n00:06:02.109 --> 00:06:06.055\ncreating a unique harmony between\nthese two very discordant worlds.\n\n00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:11.064\nPainting has always been a really\nimportant influence in all my work\n\n00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:13.799\nand I've always been a huge fan\nof Albert Bierstadt,\n\n00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:15.657\nthe great Hudson River School painter.\n\n00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:19.054\nHe inspired a recent series\nthat I did on the National Parks.\n\n00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.347\nThis is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.\n\n00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.050\nSo this is the photograph\nI created of Yosemite.\n\n00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:29.164\nThis is actually the cover story\nof the 2016 January issue\n\n00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.481\nof National Geographic.\n\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.305\nI photographed for over\n30 hours in this picture.\n\n00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:36.200\nI was literally on the side of a cliff,\n\n00:06:37.002 --> 00:06:41.043\ncapturing the stars\nand the moonlight as it transitions,\n\n00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.922\nthe moonlight lighting El Capitan.\n\n00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:46.940\nAnd I also captured this transition\nof time throughout the landscape.\n\n00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:51.548\nThe best part is obviously seeing\nthe magical moments of humanity\n\n00:06:51.572 --> 00:06:52.876\nas time changed --\n\n00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.249\nfrom day into night.\n\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.568\nAnd on a personal note,\n\n00:06:59.592 --> 00:07:03.717\nI actually had a photocopy\nof Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.\n\n00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:05.989\nAnd when that sun started\nto rise in the valley,\n\n00:07:06.013 --> 00:07:08.263\nI started to literally shake\nwith excitement\n\n00:07:08.287 --> 00:07:10.565\nbecause I looked at the painting and I go,\n\n00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.978\n\"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's\nexact same lighting\n\n00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:15.795\n100 years earlier.\"\n\n00:07:17.715 --> 00:07:20.574\nDay to Night is about all the things,\n\n00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:22.845\nit's like a compilation of all\nthe things I love\n\n00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.005\nabout the medium of photography.\n\n00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:26.682\nIt's about landscape,\n\n00:07:26.706 --> 00:07:28.305\nit's about street photography,\n\n00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.631\nit's about color, it's about architecture,\n\n00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:33.772\nperspective, scale --\nand, especially, history.\n\n00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.330\nThis is one of the most historical moments\n\n00:07:36.354 --> 00:07:37.742\nI've been able to photograph,\n\n00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:41.115\nthe 2013 Presidential Inauguration\nof Barack Obama.\n\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.765\nAnd if you look closely in this picture,\n\n00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:45.866\nyou can actually see time changing\n\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.835\nin those large television sets.\n\n00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:50.475\nYou can see Michelle\nwaiting with the children,\n\n00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:52.358\nthe president now greets the crowd,\n\n00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:53.634\nhe takes his oath,\n\n00:07:53.658 --> 00:07:55.665\nand now he's speaking to the people.\n\n00:07:56.656 --> 00:08:00.728\nThere's so many challenging aspects\nwhen I create photographs like this.\n\n00:08:01.054 --> 00:08:03.027\nFor this particular photograph,\n\n00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:06.666\nI was in a 50-foot scissor lift\nup in the air\n\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.984\nand it was not very stable.\n\n00:08:08.008 --> 00:08:11.176\nSo every time my assistant and I\nshifted our weight,\n\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.738\nour horizon line shifted.\n\n00:08:12.762 --> 00:08:14.381\nSo for every picture you see,\n\n00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:16.794\nand there were about\n1,800 in this picture,\n\n00:08:16.818 --> 00:08:19.777\nwe both had to tape our feet into position\n\n00:08:19.801 --> 00:08:21.944\nevery time I clicked the shutter.\n\n00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:26.136\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.017\nI've learned so many extraordinary\nthings doing this work.\n\n00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:34.231\nI think the two most important\nare patience\n\n00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:36.437\nand the power of observation.\n\n00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:40.318\nWhen you photograph a city\nlike New York from above,\n\n00:08:40.342 --> 00:08:42.456\nI discovered that those people in cars\n\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.790\nthat I sort of live with everyday,\n\n00:08:44.814 --> 00:08:46.870\nthey don't look like people\nin cars anymore.\n\n00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:49.372\nThey feel like a giant school of fish,\n\n00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.356\nit was a form of emergent behavior.\n\n00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:54.941\nAnd when people describe\nthe energy of New York,\n\n00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:57.901\nI think this photograph begins\nto really capture that.\n\n00:08:58.218 --> 00:08:59.953\nWhen you look closer in my work,\n\n00:08:59.977 --> 00:09:02.169\nyou can see there's stories going on.\n\n00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:05.132\nYou realize that Times Square is a canyon,\n\n00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:07.432\nit's shadow and it's sunlight.\n\n00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:11.039\nSo I decided, in this photograph,\nI would checkerboard time.\n\n00:09:11.063 --> 00:09:13.124\nSo wherever the shadows are, it's night\n\n00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:15.269\nand wherever the sun is,\nit's actually day.\n\n00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:18.661\nTime is this extraordinary thing\n\n00:09:18.685 --> 00:09:21.296\nthat we never can really\nwrap our heads around.\n\n00:09:21.898 --> 00:09:23.900\nBut in a very unique and special way,\n\n00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:27.756\nI believe these photographs\nbegin to put a face on time.\n\n00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:33.041\nThey embody a new\nmetaphysical visual reality.\n\n00:09:34.954 --> 00:09:37.708\nWhen you spend 15 hours\nlooking at a place,\n\n00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:41.082\nyou're going to see things\na little differently\n\n00:09:41.106 --> 00:09:43.114\nthan if you or I walked up\nwith our camera,\n\n00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:45.109\ntook a picture, and then walked away.\n\n00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:46.724\nThis was a perfect example.\n\n00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:48.962\nI call it \"Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Selfie.\"\n\n00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.403\nI watched over 15 hours\n\n00:09:51.427 --> 00:09:53.975\nall these people\nnot even look at Sacr\u00e9-Coeur.\n\n00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:56.499\nThey were more interested\nin using it as a backdrop.\n\n00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:59.892\nThey would walk up, take a picture,\n\n00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:01.602\nand then walk away.\n\n00:10:02.047 --> 00:10:06.617\nAnd I found this to be an absolutely\nextraordinary example,\n\n00:10:07.197 --> 00:10:11.252\na powerful disconnect between\nwhat we think the human experience is\n\n00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:14.974\nversus what the human experience\nis evolving into.\n\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.722\nThe act of sharing has suddenly\nbecome more important\n\n00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:22.641\nthan the experience itself.\n\n00:10:23.374 --> 00:10:26.615\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:29.775\nAnd finally, my most recent image,\n\n00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:33.069\nwhich has such a special meaning\nfor me personally:\n\n00:10:33.093 --> 00:10:36.537\nthis is the Serengeti National\nPark in Tanzania.\n\n00:10:36.883 --> 00:10:39.455\nAnd this is photographed\nin the middle of the Seronera,\n\n00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:40.834\nthis is not a reserve.\n\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.398\nI went specifically during\nthe peak migration\n\n00:10:44.422 --> 00:10:47.493\nto hopefully capture\nthe most diverse range of animals.\n\n00:10:48.461 --> 00:10:50.041\nUnfortunately, when we got there,\n\n00:10:50.065 --> 00:10:52.645\nthere was a drought going on\nduring the peak migration,\n\n00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:53.820\na five-week drought.\n\n00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:56.437\nSo all the animals\nwere drawn to the water.\n\n00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:58.702\nI found this one watering hole,\n\n00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:02.751\nand felt if everything remained\nthe same way it was behaving,\n\n00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:06.259\nI had a real opportunity\nto capture something unique.\n\n00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:08.088\nWe spent three days studying it,\n\n00:11:08.112 --> 00:11:09.779\nand nothing could have prepared me\n\n00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:11.803\nfor what I witnessed during our shoot day.\n\n00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:15.204\nI photographed for 26 hours\n\n00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:18.640\nin a sealed crocodile blind,\n18 feet in the air.\n\n00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:21.854\nWhat I witnessed was unimaginable.\n\n00:11:21.878 --> 00:11:23.132\nFrankly, it was Biblical.\n\n00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.504\nWe saw, for 26 hours,\n\n00:11:25.528 --> 00:11:30.758\nall these competitive species\nshare a single resource called

If you would take polls, the top three answers might be: love, wine and whining.(Laughter)Maybe. But let me suggest a fourth one: mathematics. Did you know that Paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world? And more streets with mathematicians' names, too. And if you look at the statistics of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize for mathematics, and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of 40, you will find that France has more Fields medalists per inhabitant than any other country.What is it that we find so sexy in math? After all, it seems to be dull and abstract, just numbers and computations and rules to apply. Mathematics may be abstract, but it's not dull and it's not about computing. It is about reasoning and proving our core activity. It is about imagination, the talent which we most praise. It is about finding the truth. There's nothing like the feeling which invades you when after months of hard thinking, you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem. The great mathematician Andr\u00e9 Weil likened this \u2014 no kidding \u2014 to sexual pleasure. But noted that this feeling can last for hours, or even days.The reward may be big. Hidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world. They are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses. Close your eyes for moment and think of what is occurring right now around you. Invisible particles from the air around are bumping on you by the billions and billions at each second, all in complete chaos. And still, their statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics. And open your eyes now to the statistics of the velocities of these particles.The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve, or the Law of Errors \u2014 of deviations with respect to the mean behavior. This curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles in the same way as a demographic curve would tell about the statistics of ages of individuals. It's one of the most important curves ever. It keeps on occurring again and again, from many theories and many experiments, as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathematicians.Of this curve, the famous scientist Francis Galton said, \"It would have been deified by the Greeks if they had known it. It is the supreme law of unreason.\" And there's no better way to materialize that supreme goddess than Galton's Board. Inside this board are narrow tunnels through which tiny balls will fall down randomly, going right or left, or left, etc. All in complete randomness and chaos. Let's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together.(Board shaking)This is a bit of a sport, because we need to resolve some traffic jams in there. Aha. We think that randomness is going to play me a trick on stage.There it is. Our supreme goddess of unreason. the Gauss Curve, trapped here inside this transparent box as Dream in \"The Sandman\" comics. For you I have shown it, but to my students I explain why it could not be any other curve. And this is touching the mystery of that goddess, replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation.All of science is like this. And beautiful mathematical explanations are not only for our pleasure. They also change our vision of the world. For instance, Einstein, Perrin, Smoluchowski, they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories and the Gauss Curve to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms.It was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world. More than 2,000 years ago, at the time of the ancient Greeks, it already occurred. In those days, only a small fraction of the world had been explored, and the Earth might have seemed infinite. But clever Eratosthenes, using mathematics, was able to measure the Earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent.Here's another example. In 1673, Jean Richer noticed that a pendulum swings slightly slower in Cayenne than in Paris. From this observation alone, and clever mathematics, Newton rightly deduced that the Earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles, like 0.3 percent \u2014 so tiny that you wouldn't even notice it on the real view of the Earth.These stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition measure the Earth which seems infinite, see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape. And if there is just one thing that you should take home from this talk, it is this: mathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition and explore territories which do not fit within our grasp.Here's a modern example you will all relate to: searching the Internet. The World Wide Web, more than one billion web pages \u2014 do you want to go through them all? Computing power helps, but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling to find the information hidden in the data.Let's work out a baby problem. Imagine that you're a detective working on a crime case, and there are many people who have their version of the facts. Who do you want to interview first? Sensible answer: prime witnesses. You see, suppose that there is person number seven, tells you a story, but when you ask where he got if from, he points to person number three as a source. And maybe person number three, in turn, points at person number one as the primary source. Now number one is a prime witness, so I definitely want to interview him \u2014 priority. And from the graph we also see that person number four is a prime witness. And maybe I even want to interview him first, because there are more people who refer to him.OK, that was easy, but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify? And this graph, I may think of it as all people who testify in a complicated crime case, but it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other, referring to each other for contents. Which ones are the most authoritative? Not so clear.Enter PageRank, one of the early cornerstones of Google. This algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to determine automatically the most relevant web pages, in the same way as we used randomness in the Galton Board experiment. So let's send into this graph a bunch of tiny, digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph. Each time they arrive at some site, they will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one. And again, and again, and again. And with small, growing piles, we'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited by these digital marbles.Here we go. Randomness, randomness. And from time to time, also let's make jumps completely randomly to increase the fun.And look at this: from the chaos will emerge the solution. The highest piles correspond to those sites which somehow are better connected than the others, more pointed at than the others. And here we see clearly which are the web pages we want to first try. Once again, the solution emerges from the randomness. Of course, since that time, Google has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms, but already this was beautiful.And still, just one problem in a million. With the advent of digital area, more and more problems lend themselves to mathematical analysis, making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one, to the extent that a few years ago, it was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs in a study about the best and worst jobs published by the Wall Street Journal in 2009.Mathematician \u2014 best job in the world. That's because of the applications: communication theory, information theory, game theory, compressed sensing, machine learning, graph analysis, harmonic analysis. And why not stochastic processes, linear programming, or fluid simulation? Each of these fields have monster industrial applications. And through them, there is big money in mathematics. And let me concede that when it comes to making money from the math, the Americans are by a long shot the world champions, with clever, emblematic billionaires and amazing, giant companies, all resting, ultimately, on good algorithm.Now with all this beauty, usefulness and wealth, mathematics does look more sexy. But don't you think that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one. It is filled with perplexity, frustration, a desperate fight for understanding.Let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician's life. Or should I say, one of the most striking nights. At that time, I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton \u2014 for many years, the home of Albert Einstein and arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world. And that night I was working and working on an elusive proof, which was incomplete. It was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas, which are a crowd of electrons. In the perfect world of plasma, there are no collisions and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to. But still, if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium, you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes, or damps out, as if by some mysterious friction force.This paradoxical effect, called the Landau damping, is one of the most important in plasma physics, and it was discovered through mathematical ideas. But still, a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing. And together with my former student and main collaborator Cl\u00e9ment Mouhot, in Paris at the time, we had been working for months and months on such a proof. Actually, I had already announced by mistake that we could solve it. But the truth is, the proof was just not working. In spite of more than 100 pages of complicated, mathematical arguments, and a bunch discoveries, and huge calculation, it was not working. And that night in Princeton, a certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy. I was putting in there all my energy and experience and tricks, and still nothing was working. 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m., not working. Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits. Then a few hours later, waking up and go, \"Ah, it's time to get the kids to school \u2014\" What is this? There was this voice in my head, I swear. \"Take the second term to the other side, Fourier transform and invert in L2.\"(Laughter)Damn it, that was the start of the solution!You see, I thought I had taken some rest, but really my brain had continued to work on it. In those moments, you don't think of your career or your colleagues, it's just a complete battle between the problem and you.That being said, it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work. And after we completed our huge analysis of the Landau damping, I was lucky enough to get the most coveted Fields Medal from the hands of the President of India, in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 \u2014 an honor that mathematicians never dare to dream, a day that I will remember until I live.What do you think, on such an occasion? Pride, yes? And gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible. And because it was a collective adventure, you need to share it, not just with your collaborators. I believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research, and share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it. And I've been working with my staff at Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9, together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide, so that we can found our own, very special museum of mathematics there.So in a few years, when you come to Paris, after tasting the great, crispy baguette and macaroon, please come and visit us at Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9, and share the mathematical dream with us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2518, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:17.174\nWhat is it that French people\ndo better than

imperceptible\nvariation of shape.\n\n00:06:44.702 --> 00:06:48.549\nAnd if there is just one thing that you\nshould take home from this talk,\n\n00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:49.767\nit is this:\n\n00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:54.169\nmathematics allows us\nto go beyond the intuition\n\n00:06:54.193 --> 00:06:58.442\nand explore territories\nwhich do not fit within our grasp.\n\n00:06:59.567 --> 00:07:02.566\nHere's a modern example\nyou will all relate to:\n\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.987\nsearching the Internet.\n\n00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:07.337\nThe World Wide Web,\n\n00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:09.165\nmore than one billion web pages --\n\n00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:10.863\ndo you want to go through them all?\n\n00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:13.420\nComputing power helps,\n\n00:07:13.444 --> 00:07:16.630\nbut it would be useless without\nthe mathematical modeling\n\n00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:19.217\nto find the information\nhidden in the data.\n\n00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.828\nLet's work out a baby problem.\n\n00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.637\nImagine that you're a detective\nworking on a crime case,\n\n00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:31.449\nand there are many people\nwho have their version of the facts.\n\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.735\nWho do you want to interview first?\n\n00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.554\nSensible answer:\n\n00:07:36.578 --> 00:07:38.015\nprime witnesses.\n\n00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:40.070\nYou see,\n\n00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:44.314\nsuppose that there is person number seven,\n\n00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:45.489\ntells you a story,\n\n00:07:45.513 --> 00:07:47.527\nbut when you ask where he got if from,\n\n00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:50.587\nhe points to person\nnumber three as a source.\n\n00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:52.679\nAnd maybe person number three, in turn,\n\n00:07:52.703 --> 00:07:56.399\npoints at person number one\nas the primary source.\n\n00:07:56.423 --> 00:07:58.084\nNow number one is a prime witness,\n\n00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:01.346\nso I definitely want\nto interview him -- priority.\n\n00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.257\nAnd from the graph\n\n00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:06.509\nwe also see that person\nnumber four is a prime witness.\n\n00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:08.976\nAnd maybe I even want\nto interview him first,\n\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.359\nbecause there are more\npeople who refer to him.\n\n00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:14.976\nOK, that was easy,\n\n00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.246\nbut now what about if you have\na big bunch of people who will testify?\n\n00:08:20.822 --> 00:08:22.174\nAnd this graph,\n\n00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:27.817\nI may think of it as all people\nwho testify in a complicated crime case,\n\n00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:31.863\nbut it may just as well be web pages\npointing to each other,\n\n00:08:31.887 --> 00:08:33.958\nreferring to each other for contents.\n\n00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:37.172\nWhich ones are the most authoritative?\n\n00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:38.879\nNot so clear.\n\n00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.949\nEnter PageRank,\n\n00:08:41.973 --> 00:08:44.509\none of the early cornerstones of Google.\n\n00:08:45.295 --> 00:08:49.537\nThis algorithm uses the laws\nof mathematical randomness\n\n00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:53.418\nto determine automatically\nthe most relevant web pages,\n\n00:08:53.442 --> 00:08:58.504\nin the same way as we used randomness\nin the Galton Board experiment.\n\n00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:01.640\nSo let's send into this graph\n\n00:09:01.664 --> 00:09:04.514\na bunch of tiny, digital marbles\n\n00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:08.287\nand let them go randomly\nthrough the graph.\n\n00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.978\nEach time they arrive at some site,\n\n00:09:10.002 --> 00:09:14.168\nthey will go out through some link\nchosen at random to the next one.\n\n00:09:14.192 --> 00:09:15.945\nAnd again, and again, and again.\n\n00:09:16.316 --> 00:09:17.944\nAnd with small, growing piles,\n\n00:09:17.968 --> 00:09:21.721\nwe'll keep the record of how many\ntimes each site has been visited\n\n00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:23.690\nby these digital marbles.\n\n00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:25.352\nHere we go.\n\n00:09:25.376 --> 00:09:27.224\nRandomness, randomness.\n\n00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:29.217\nAnd from time to time,\n\n00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:33.193\nalso let's make jumps completely\nrandomly to increase the fun.\n\n00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:35.645\nAnd look at this:\n\n00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:39.101\nfrom the chaos will emerge the solution.\n\n00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:41.926\nThe highest piles\ncorrespond to those sites\n\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.461\nwhich somehow are better\nconnected than the others,\n\n00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:47.758\nmore pointed at than the others.\n\n00:09:47.782 --> 00:09:49.504\nAnd here we see clearly\n\n00:09:49.528 --> 00:09:52.560\nwhich are the web pages\nwe want to first try.\n\n00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:54.616\nOnce again,\n\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.100\nthe solution emerges from the randomness.\n\n00:09:57.733 --> 00:09:59.984\nOf course, since that time,\n\n00:10:00.008 --> 00:10:03.715\nGoogle has come up with much more\nsophisticated algorithms,\n\n00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:06.019\nbut already this was beautiful.\n\n00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:08.415\nAnd still,\n\n00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:10.050\njust one problem in a million.\n\n00:10:10.692 --> 00:10:12.962\nWith the advent of digital area,\n\n00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:18.002\nmore and more problems lend\nthemselves to mathematical analysis,\n\n00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:22.391\nmaking the job of mathematician\na more and more useful one,\n\n00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:25.846\nto the extent that a few years ago,\n\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.649\nit was ranked number one\namong hundreds of jobs\n\n00:10:29.673 --> 00:10:33.641\nin a study about the best and worst jobs\n\n00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:36.640\npublished by the Wall Street\nJournal in 2009.\n\n00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.255\nMathematician --\n\n00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.712\nbest job in the world.\n\n00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:44.672\nThat's because of the applications:\n\n00:10:44.696 --> 00:10:46.835\ncommunication theory,\n\n00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:48.679\ninformation theory,\n\n00:10:48.703 --> 00:10:49.963\ngame theory,\n\n00:10:49.987 --> 00:10:51.433\ncompressed sensing,\n\n00:10:51.457 --> 00:10:53.019\nmachine learning,\n\n00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:54.610\ngraph analysis,\n\n00:10:54.634 --> 00:10:56.376\nharmonic analysis.\n\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.040\nAnd why not stochastic processes,\n\n00:10:59.064 --> 00:11:00.694\nlinear programming,\n\n00:11:00.718 --> 00:11:02.746\nor fluid simulation?\n\n00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.145\nEach of these fields have\nmonster industrial applications.\n\n00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:08.320\nAnd through them,\n\n00:11:08.344 --> 00:11:10.343\nthere is big money in mathematics.\n\n00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:13.398\nAnd let me concede\n\n00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.899\nthat when it comes to making\nmoney from the math,\n\n00:11:15.923 --> 00:11:19.747\nthe Americans are by a long shot\nthe world champions,\n\n00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:24.390\nwith clever, emblematic billionaires\nand amazing, giant companies,\n\n00:11:24.414 --> 00:11:27.694\nall resting, ultimately,\non good algorithm.\n\n00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:33.021\nNow with all this beauty,\nusefulness and wealth,\n\n00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:35.329\nmathematics does look more sexy.\n\n00:11:36.357 --> 00:11:37.974\nBut don't you think\n\n00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:42.118\nthat the life a mathematical\nresearcher is an easy one.\n\n00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:45.658\nIt is filled with perplexity,\n\n00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:47.455\nfrustration,\n\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.575\na desperate fight for understanding.\n\n00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:54.053\nLet me evoke for you\n\n00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:58.457\none of the most striking days\nin my mathematician's life.\n\n00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.632\nOr should I say,\n\n00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:01.393\none of the most striking nights.\n\n00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:03.822\nAt that time,\n\n00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:06.997\nI was staying at the Institute\nfor Advanced Studies in Princeton --\n\n00:12:07.021 --> 00:12:09.160\nfor many years, the home\nof Albert Einstein\n\n00:12:09.184 --> 00:12:13.612\nand arguably the most holy place\nfor mathematical research in the world.\n\n00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:18.680\nAnd that night I was working\nand working on an elusive proof,\n\n00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.082\nwhich was incomplete.\n\n00:12:21.262 --> 00:12:23.470\nIt was all about understanding\n\n00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:27.317\nthe paradoxical stability\nproperty of plasmas,\n\n00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:29.299\nwhich are a crowd of electrons.\n\n00:12:30.381 --> 00:12:33.117\nIn the perfect world of plasma,\n\n00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:34.919\nthere are no collisions\n\n00:12:34.943 --> 00:12:38.601\nand no friction to provide\nthe stability like we are used to.\n\n00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.501\nBut still,\n\n00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:43.558\nif you slightly perturb\na plasma equilibrium,\n\n00:12:43.582 --> 00:12:46.270\nyou will find that the\nresulting electric field\n\n00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:48.633\nspontaneously vanishes,\n\n00:12:48.657 --> 00:12:50.632\nor damps out,\n\n00:12:50.656 --> 00:12:53.950\nas if by some mysterious friction force.\n\n00:12:54.686 --> 00:12:56.521\nThis paradoxical effect,\n\n00:12:56.545 --> 00:12:58.022\ncalled the Landau damping,\n\n00:12:58.046 --> 00:13:01.035\nis one of the most important\nin plasma physics,\n\n00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:04.061\nand it was discovered\nthrough mathematical ideas.\n\n00:13:04.928 --> 00:13:06.079\nBut still,\n\n00:13:06.103 --> 00:13:10.333\na full mathematical understanding\nof this phenomenon was missing.\n\n00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:15.143\nAnd together with my former student\nand main collaborator Cl\u00e9ment Mouhot,\n\n00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:16.659\nin Paris at the time,\n\n00:13:16.683 --> 00:13:20.769\nwe had been working for months\nand months on such a proof.\n\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.125\nActually,\n\n00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:27.895\nI had already announced by mistake\nthat we could solve it.\n\n00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:29.644\nBut the truth is,\n\n00:13:29.668 --> 00:13:31.815\nthe proof was just not working.\n\n00:13:32.154 --> 00:13:36.503\nIn spite of more than 100 pages\nof complicated, mathematical arguments,\n\n00:13:36.527 --> 00:13:38.217\nand a bunch discoveries,\n\n00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:39.508\nand huge calculation,\n\n00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:40.701\nit was not working.\n\n00:13:41.248 --> 00:13:42.929\nAnd that night in Princeton,\n\n00:13:42.953 --> 00:13:47.254\na certain gap in the chain of arguments\nwas driving me crazy.\n\n00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:52.209\nI was putting in there all my energy\nand experience and tricks,\n\n00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:53.975\nand still nothing was working.\n\n00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:58.393\n1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,\n\n00:13:58.417 --> 00:13:59.725\nnot working.\n\n00:14:00.503 --> 00:14:04.824\nAround 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.\n\n00:14:05.873 --> 00:14:08.333\nThen a few hours later,\n\n00:14:08.357 --> 00:14:09.508\nwaking up and go,\n\n00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:12.889\n\"Ah, it's time to get\nthe kids to school --\"\n\n00:14:12.913 --> 00:14:14.064\nWhat is this?\n\n00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:16.230\nThere was this voice in my head, I swear.\n\n00:14:16.852 --> 00:14:18.765\n\"Take the second term to the other side,\n\n00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:20.708\nFourier transform and invert in L2.\"\n\n00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:22.366\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.092\nDamn it,\n\n00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:26.229\nthat was the start of the solution!\n\n00:14:27.477 --> 00:14:28.628\nYou see,\n\n00:14:28.652 --> 00:14:30.935\nI thought I had taken some rest,\n\n00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:34.347\nbut really my brain had\ncontinued to work on it.\n\n00:14:34.966 --> 00:14:36.563\nIn those moments,\n\n00:14:36.587 --> 00:14:39.188\nyou don't think of your career\nor your colleagues,\n\n00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.902\nit's just a complete battle\nbetween the problem and you.\n\n00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:45.384\nThat being said,\n\n00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:49.357\nit does not harm when you do get\na promotion in reward for your hard work.\n\n00:14:49.766 --> 00:14:54.926\nAnd after we completed our huge\nanalysis of the Landau damping,\n\n00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.565\nI was lucky enough\n\n00:14:56.589 --> 00:14:59.619\nto get the most coveted Fields Medal\n\n00:14:59.643 --> 00:15:02.510\nfrom the hands of the President of India,\n\n00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:06.454\nin Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 --\n\n00:15:07.411 -->

And when we get access to them, we are blown away, we fall in love. But most of the time, the world's population is living without real access to arts and culture. What might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage, the beautiful locations and the art in this world?Before we get started in this presentation, I just want to take care of a few housekeeping points. First, I am no expert in art or culture. I fell into this by mistake, but I'm loving it. Secondly, all of what I'm going to show you belongs to the amazing museums, archives and foundations that we partner with. None of this belongs to Google. And finally, what you see behind me is available right now on your mobile phones, on your laptops.This is our current platform, where you can explore thousands of museums and objects at your fingertips, in extremely high-definition detail. The diversity of the content is what's amazing. If we just had European paintings, if we just had modern art, I think it gets a bit boring. For example, this month, we launched the \"Black History\" channel with 82 curated exhibitions, which talk about arts and culture in that community. We also have some amazing objects from Japan, centered around craftsmanship, called \"Made in Japan.\" And one of my favorite exhibitions, which actually is the idea of my talk, is \u2014 I didn't expect to become a fan of Japanese dolls. But I am, thanks to this exhibition, that has really taught me about the craftsmanship behind the soul of a Japanese doll. Trust me, it's very exciting. Take my word for it.So, moving on swiftly. One quick thing I wanted to showcase in this platform, which you can share with your kids and your friends right now, is you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually, as well. One of our recent ideas was with The Guggenheim Museum in New York, where you can get a taste of what it might feel like to actually be there. You can go to the ground floor and obviously, most of you, I assume, have been there. And you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is. But imagine this accessibility for a kid in Bombay who's studying architecture, who hasn't had a chance to go to The Guggenheim as yet. You can obviously look at objects in the Guggenheim Museum, you can obviously get into them and so on and so forth. There's a lot of information here.But this is not the purpose of my talk today. This exists right now. What we now have are the building blocks to a very exciting future, when it comes to arts and culture and accessibility to arts and culture. So I am joined today onstage by my good friend and artist in residence at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne, who is the professor of interactive design at ECAL University in Lausanne, Switzerland. What Cyril and our team of engineers have been doing is trying to find these connections and visualize a few of these.So I'm going to go quite quick now. This object you see behind me \u2014 oh, just clarification: Always, seeing the real thing is better. In case people think I'm trying to replicate the real thing. So, moving on. This object you see behind me is the Venus of Berekhat Ram. It's one of the oldest objects in the world, found in the Golan Heights around 233,000 years ago, and currently residing at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. It is also one of the oldest objects on our platform.So let's zoom. We start from this one object. What if we zoomed out and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang? What might that look like? This is what we deal with on a daily basis at the Cultural Institute \u2014 over six million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions, to actually make these connections. You can travel through time, you can understand more about our society through these. You can look at it from the perspective of our planet, and try to see how it might look without borders, if we just organized art and culture. We can also then plot it by time, which obviously, for the data geek in me, is very fascinating. You can spend hours looking at every decade and the contributions in that decade and in those years for art, history and cultures. We would love to spend hours showing you each and every decade, but we don't have the time right now. So you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself.(Applause)But if you don't mind and can hold your applause till later, I don't want to run out of time, because I want to show you a lot of cool stuff.So, just very quickly: you can move on from here to another very interesting idea. Beyond the pretty picture, beyond the nice visualization, what is the purpose, how is this useful? This next idea comes from discussions with curators that we've been having at museums, who, by the way, I've fallen in love with, because they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories. One of the curators told me, \"Amit, what would it be like if you could create a virtual curator's table where all these six million objects are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them?\" You can spend a lot of time, trust me, looking at different objects and understanding where they come from. It's a crazy Matrix experience.(Laughter)Just moving on, let's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh, who is very well-represented on this platform. Thanks to the diversity of the institutions we have, we have over 211 high-definition, amazing artworks by this artist, now organized in one beautiful view. And as it resolves, and as Cyril goes deeper, you can see all the self-portraits, you can see still life. But I just wanted to highlight one very quick example, which is very timely: \"The Bedroom.\" This is an artwork where three copies exist \u2014 one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, one at the Orsay in Paris and one at the Art Institute of Chicago, which, actually, currently is hosting a reunion of all three artworks physically, I think only for the second time ever. But, it is united digitally and virtually for anybody to look at in a very different way, and you won't get pushed in the line in the crowd. So let's take you and let's travel through \"The Bedroom\" very quickly, so you can experience what we are doing for every single object. We want the image to speak as much as it can on a digital platform. And all you need is an internet connection and a computer(Applause)And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly. I'm sorry, this is all live, so you have to give Cyril a little bit of \u2014 and this is available for every object: modern art, contemporary art, Renaissance \u2014 you name it, even sculpture.Sometimes, you don't know what can attract you to an artwork or to a museum or to a cultural discovery. So for me, personally, it was quite a challenge because when I decided to make this my full-time job at Google, my mother was not very supportive. I love my mother, but she thought I was wasting my life with this museum stuff. And for her, a museum is what you do when you go on vacation and you tick-mark and it's over, right? And it took around four and a half years for me to convince my lovely Indian mother that actually, this is worthwhile. And the way I did it was, I realized one day that she loves gold. So I started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them. And the first thing my mom asks me is, \"How can we buy these?\"(Laughter)And obviously, my salary is not that high, so I was like, \"We can't actually do that, mom. But you can explore them virtually.\" And so now my mom \u2014 every time I meet her, she asks me, \"Any more gold, any more silver in your project? Can you show me?\" And that's the idea I'm trying to illustrate. It does not matter how you get in, as long as you get in. Once you get in, you're hooked.Moving on from here very quickly, there is kind of a playful idea, actually, to illustrate the point of access, and I'm going to go quite quickly on this one. We all know that seeing the artwork in person is amazing. But we also know that most of us can't do it, and the ones that can afford to do it, it's complicated. So \u2014 Cyril, can we load up our art trip, what do we call it? We don't have a good name for this. But essentially, we have around 1,000 amazing institutions, 68 countries. But let's start with Rembrandt. We might have time for only one example. But thanks to the diversity, we've got around 500 amazing Rembrandt object artworks from 46 institutions and 17 countries. Let's say that on your next vacation, you want to go see every single one of them. That is your itinerary, you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers, visit around, I think, 46 institutions, and just FYI, you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions.(Laughter)But remember, it's art, so you can justify it, perhaps, in some way.Moving on swiftly from here, is something a little bit more technical and more interesting. All that we've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections. But obviously we have something cool nowadays that everyone likes to talk about, which is machine learning. So what we thought is, let's strip out all the metadata, let's look at what machine learning can do based purely on visual recognition of this entire collection. What we ended up with is this very interesting map, these clusters that have no reference point information, but has just used visuals to cluster things together. Each cluster is an art to us by itself of discovery. But one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly is this amazing cluster of portraits that we found from museums around the world. If you could zoom in a little bit more, Cyril. Just to show you, you can just travel through portraits. And essentially, you can do nature, you can do horses and clusters galore.When we saw all these portraits, we were like, \"Hey, can we do something fun for kids, or can we do something playful to get people interested in portraits?\" Because I haven't really seen young kids really excited to go to a portrait gallery. I wanted to try to figure something out. So we created something called the portrait matcher. It's quite self-explanatory, so I'm just going to let Cyril show his beautiful face. And essentially what's happening is, with the movement of his head, we are matching different portraits around the world from museums.(Applause)And I don't know about you, but I've shown it to my nephew and sister, and the reaction is just phenomenal. All they ask me is, \"When can we go see this?\" And by the way, if we're nice, maybe, Cyril, you can smile and find a happy one? Oh, perfect. By the way, this is not rehearsed. Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow. OK, let's move on; otherwise, this will just take the whole time.(Applause)So, art and culture can be fun also, right? For our last quick experiment \u2014 we call all of these \"experiments\" \u2014 our last quick experiment comes back to machine learning. We show you clusters, visual clusters, but what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters? What if it could automatically tag them, using no actual metadata? So what we have is this kind of explorer, where we have managed to match, I think, around 4,000 labels. And we haven't really done anything special here, just fed the collection. And we found interesting categories. We can start with horses, a very straightforward category. You would expect to see that the machine has put images of horses, right? And it has, but you also notice, right over there, that it has a very abstract image that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses. We also have an amazing head in terms of a horse. And each one has the tags as to why it got categorized in this.So let's move to another one which I found very funny and interesting, because I don't understand how this category came up. It's called \"Lady in Waiting.\" If, Cyril, you do it very quickly, you will see that we have these amazing images of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing. I don't really understand it. But I've been trying to ask my museum contacts, you know, \"What is this? What's going on here?\" And it's fascinating.Coming back to gold very quickly, I wanted to search for gold and see how the machine tagged all the gold. But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold. We are living in popular times. It tags it as \"bling-bling.\"(Laughter)I'm being hard on Cyril, because I'm moving too fast. Essentially, here you have all the bling-bling of the world's museums organized for you.And finally, to end this talk and these experiments, what I hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion. And what would we see when we see happiness? If we actually look at all the objects that have been tagged under \"happiness,\" you would expect happiness, I guess. But there was one that came up that was very fascinating and interesting, which was this artwork by Douglas Coupland, our friend and artist in residence as well, called, \"I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain.\" I don't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre-Internet brain and it's been tagged here, but it's a very interesting thought. I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain, but not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online.So take out your phones, take out your computers, go visit museums. And just a quick call-out to all the amazing archivists, historians, curators, who are sitting in museums, preserving all this culture. And the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture for ourselves and our kids.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2519, "subtitle":

let's zoom.\n\n00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.415\nWe start from this one object.\n\n00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.480\nWhat if we zoomed out\n\n00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:03.010\nand actually tried to experience\nour own cultural big bang?\n\n00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.612\nWhat might that look like?\n\n00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:09.089\nThis is what we deal with on a daily basis\nat the Cultural Institute --\n\n00:04:09.113 --> 00:04:14.075\nover six million cultural artifacts\ncurated and given to us by institutions,\n\n00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.045\nto actually make these

organized art and culture.\n\n00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:33.033\nWe can also then plot it by time,\n\n00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:37.137\nwhich obviously, for the data geek\nin me, is very fascinating.\n\n00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:40.547\nYou can spend hours\nlooking at every decade\n\n00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.887\nand the contributions\nin that decade and in those years\n\n00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:46.244\nfor art, history and cultures.\n\n00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:49.647\nWe would love to spend hours\nshowing you each and every decade,\n\n00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:51.532\nbut we don't have the time right now.\n\n00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:54.815\nSo you can go on your phone\nand actually do it yourself.\n\n00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:58.301\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:01.427\nBut if you don't mind\nand can hold your applause till later,\n\n00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:02.999\nI don't want to run out of time,\n\n00:05:03.023 --> 00:05:05.222\nbecause I want to show you\na lot of cool stuff.\n\n00:05:05.246 --> 00:05:06.746\nSo, just very quickly:\n\n00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.756\nyou can move on from here\nto another very interesting idea.\n\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.491\nBeyond the pretty picture,\n\n00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:14.304\nbeyond the nice visualization,\n\n00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:16.655\nwhat is the purpose, how is this useful?\n\n00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:21.408\nThis next idea comes\nfrom discussions with curators\n\n00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:23.067\nthat we've been having at museums,\n\n00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:25.114\nwho, by the way, I've fallen in love with,\n\n00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:28.332\nbecause they dedicate their whole life\nto try to tell these stories.\n\n00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:31.287\nOne of the curators told me,\n\"Amit, what would it be like\n\n00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:33.790\nif you could create\na virtual curator's table\n\n00:05:33.814 --> 00:05:36.117\nwhere all these six million objects\n\n00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:40.544\nare displayed in a way for us\nto look at the connections between them?\"\n\n00:05:40.568 --> 00:05:44.597\nYou can spend a lot of time, trust me,\nlooking at different objects\n\n00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.574\nand understanding where they come from.\n\n00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:48.806\nIt's a crazy Matrix experience.\n\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.844\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.154\nJust moving on,\n\n00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:54.349\nlet's take the world-famous\nVincent Van Gogh,\n\n00:05:54.373 --> 00:05:58.088\nwho is very well-represented\non this platform.\n\n00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:00.888\nThanks to the diversity\nof the institutions we have,\n\n00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:06.616\nwe have over 211 high-definition,\namazing artworks by this artist,\n\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.387\nnow organized in one beautiful view.\n\n00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:13.384\nAnd as it resolves,\nand as Cyril goes deeper,\n\n00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:15.617\nyou can see all the self-portraits,\n\n00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.066\nyou can see still life.\n\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.693\nBut I just wanted to highlight\none very quick example,\n\n00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:21.405\nwhich is very timely:\n\n00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:22.740\n\"The Bedroom.\"\n\n00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:25.065\nThis is an artwork\nwhere three copies exist --\n\n00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:27.419\none at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,\n\n00:06:27.443 --> 00:06:29.430\none at the Orsay in Paris\n\n00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:31.388\nand one at the Art Institute of Chicago,\n\n00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:33.915\nwhich, actually, currently\nis hosting a reunion\n\n00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.714\nof all three artworks physically,\n\n00:06:35.738 --> 00:06:37.875\nI think only for the second time ever.\n\n00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:42.818\nBut, it is united digitally and virtually\nfor anybody to look at\n\n00:06:42.842 --> 00:06:44.763\nin a very different way,\n\n00:06:44.787 --> 00:06:47.820\nand you won't get pushed\nin the line in the crowd.\n\n00:06:47.844 --> 00:06:52.586\nSo let's take you and let's travel\nthrough \"The Bedroom\" very quickly,\n\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.197\nso you can experience what we are doing\nfor every single object.\n\n00:06:56.221 --> 00:06:59.672\nWe want the image to speak\nas much as it can\n\n00:06:59.696 --> 00:07:01.340\non a digital platform.\n\n00:07:01.364 --> 00:07:04.511\nAnd all you need is an internet\nconnection and a computer\n\n00:07:04.535 --> 00:07:08.873\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:08.897 --> 00:07:11.455\nAnd, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.\n\n00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:12.963\nI'm sorry, this is all live,\n\n00:07:12.987 --> 00:07:15.422\nso you have to give Cyril\na little bit of --\n\n00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:18.419\nand this is available for every object:\n\n00:07:18.443 --> 00:07:21.158\nmodern art, contemporary art,\nRenaissance -- you name it,\n\n00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:22.369\neven sculpture.\n\n00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.355\nSometimes, you don't know\nwhat can attract you\n\n00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:32.607\nto an artwork or to a museum\nor to a cultural discovery.\n\n00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:35.373\nSo for me, personally,\nit was quite a challenge\n\n00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:38.619\nbecause when I decided to make this\nmy full-time job at Google,\n\n00:07:38.643 --> 00:07:41.246\nmy mother was not very supportive.\n\n00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.517\nI love my mother,\n\n00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:45.540\nbut she thought I was wasting my life\nwith this museum stuff.\n\n00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.876\nAnd for her, a museum is what\nyou do when you go on vacation\n\n00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.867\nand you tick-mark and it's over, right?\n\n00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:53.422\nAnd it took around four and a half years\n\n00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:55.660\nfor me to convince my lovely Indian mother\n\n00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.337\nthat actually, this is worthwhile.\n\n00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:00.802\nAnd the way I did it was,\nI realized one day that she loves gold.\n\n00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:06.401\nSo I started showing her all objects\nthat have the material gold in them.\n\n00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:09.076\nAnd the first thing my mom asks me is,\n\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.528\n\"How can we buy these?\"\n\n00:08:11.552 --> 00:08:13.370\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:13.394 --> 00:08:16.536\nAnd obviously, my salary is not that high,\n\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.938\nso I was like, \"We can't\nactually do that, mom.\n\n00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:21.073\nBut you can explore them virtually.\"\n\n00:08:21.097 --> 00:08:24.516\nAnd so now my mom -- every time\nI meet her, she asks me,\n\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.006\n\"Any more gold, any more silver\nin your project? Can you show me?\"\n\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.204\nAnd that's the idea\nI'm trying to illustrate.\n\n00:08:30.228 --> 00:08:32.366\nIt does not matter how you get in,\n\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.752\nas long as you get in.\n\n00:08:33.776 --> 00:08:35.386\nOnce you get in, you're hooked.\n\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.759\nMoving on from here very quickly,\n\n00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:40.632\nthere is kind of a playful idea, actually,\n\n00:08:40.656 --> 00:08:42.291\nto illustrate the point of access,\n\n00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:44.737\nand I'm going to go\nquite quickly on this one.\n\n00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:50.168\nWe all know that seeing the artwork\nin person is amazing.\n\n00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:52.775\nBut we also know\nthat most of us can't do it,\n\n00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.557\nand the ones that can afford\nto do it, it's complicated.\n\n00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:59.388\nSo -- Cyril, can we load\nup our art trip, what do we call it?\n\n00:08:59.412 --> 00:09:01.174\nWe don't have a good name for this.\n\n00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:06.169\nBut essentially, we have\naround 1,000 amazing institutions,\n\n00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:07.360\n68 countries.\n\n00:09:07.384 --> 00:09:09.084\nBut let's start with Rembrandt.\n\n00:09:09.108 --> 00:09:11.350\nWe might have time for only one example.\n\n00:09:11.374 --> 00:09:13.603\nBut thanks to the diversity,\n\n00:09:13.627 --> 00:09:17.531\nwe've got around 500 amazing\nRembrandt object artworks\n\n00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:19.824\nfrom 46 institutions and 17 countries.\n\n00:09:19.848 --> 00:09:22.400\nLet's say that on your next vacation,\n\n00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:24.474\nyou want to go see\nevery single one of them.\n\n00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:25.832\nThat is your itinerary,\n\n00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:29.510\nyou will probably travel\n53,000 kilometers,\n\n00:09:29.534 --> 00:09:32.121\nvisit around, I think, 46 institutions,\n\n00:09:32.145 --> 00:09:36.336\nand just FYI, you might release\n10 tons of CO2 emissions.\n\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.823\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:37.847 --> 00:09:39.320\nBut remember, it's art,\n\n00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:42.009\nso you can justify it,\nperhaps, in some way.\n\n00:09:42.795 --> 00:09:44.717\nMoving on swiftly from here,\n\n00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:47.676\nis something a little bit\nmore technical and more interesting.\n\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.637\nAll that we've shown you so far\nuses metadata to make the connections.\n\n00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:54.771\nBut obviously we have\nsomething cool nowadays\n\n00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.707\nthat everyone likes to talk about,\nwhich is machine learning.\n\n00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:00.805\nSo what we thought is,\nlet's strip out all the metadata,\n\n00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:04.441\nlet's look at what machine learning can do\n\n00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:08.788\nbased purely on visual recognition\nof this entire collection.\n\n00:10:08.812 --> 00:10:13.005\nWhat we ended up with\nis this very interesting map,\n\n00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:17.339\nthese clusters that have\nno reference point information,\n\n00:10:17.363 --> 00:10:21.328\nbut has just used visuals\nto cluster things together.\n\n00:10:21.352 --> 00:10:24.934\nEach cluster is an art to us\nby itself of discovery.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.621\nBut one of the clusters we want\nto show you very quickly\n\n00:10:27.645 --> 00:10:30.297\nis this amazing cluster of portraits\n\n00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:32.723\nthat we found from museums\naround the world.\n\n00:10:32.747 --> 00:10:34.930\nIf you could zoom in\na little bit more, Cyril.\n\n00:10:34.954 --> 00:10:38.786\nJust to show you, you can\njust travel through portraits.\n\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.584\nAnd essentially, you can do nature,\nyou can do horses\n\n00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:43.364\nand clusters galore.\n\n00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:45.815\nWhen we saw all these portraits,\n\n00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:49.491\nwe were like, \"Hey, can we do\nsomething fun for kids,\n\n00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.197\nor can we do something playful\n\n00:10:51.221 --> 00:10:53.246\nto get people interested in portraits?\"\n\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.450\nBecause I haven't really seen\n\n00:10:55.474 --> 00:10:58.841\nyoung kids really excited\nto go to a portrait gallery.\n\n00:10:59.315 --> 00:11:01.247\nI wanted to try to figure something out.\n\n00:11:01.271 --> 00:11:03.738\nSo we created something\ncalled the portrait matcher.\n\n00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:05.079\nIt's quite self-explanatory,\n\n00:11:05.103 --> 00:11:07.841\nso I'm just going to let Cyril\nshow his beautiful face.\n\n00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:11.997\nAnd essentially what's happening is,\nwith the movement of his head,\n\n00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:16.188\nwe are matching different portraits\naround the world from museums.\n\n00:11:16.212 --> 00:11:18.408\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:29.403 --> 00:11:31.109\nAnd I don't know about you,\n\n00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:33.149\nbut I've shown it to my nephew and sister,\n\n00:11:33.173 --> 00:11:35.022\nand the reaction is just phenomenal.\n\n00:11:35.046 --> 00:11:37.752\nAll they ask me is,\n\"When can we go see this?\"\n\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.023\nAnd by the way, if we're nice,\n\n00:11:41.047 --> 00:11:43.868\nmaybe, Cyril, you can smile\nand find a happy one?\n\n00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:46.052\nOh, perfect.\n\n00:11:46.076 --> 00:11:48.064\nBy the way, this is not rehearsed.\n\n00:11:48.432 --> 00:11:51.012\nCongrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.\n\n00:11:51.036 --> 00:11:54.512\nOK, let's move on; otherwise,\nthis will just take the whole time.\n\n00:11:54.536 --> 00:11:56.254\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:56.278 --> 00:11:58.858\nSo, art and culture\ncan be fun also, right?\n\n00:11:59.858 --> 00:12:03.255\nFor our last quick experiment --\n\n00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.042\nwe call all of these \"experiments\" --\n\n00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:07.955\nour last quick experiment\ncomes back to machine learning.\n\n00:12:07.979 --> 00:12:10.820\nWe show you clusters, visual clusters,\n\n00:12:10.844 --> 00:12:15.745\nbut what if we could ask the machine\nto also name these clusters?\n\n00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:20.522\nWhat if it could automatically tag\nthem, using no actual metadata?\n\n00:12:20.546 --> 00:12:24.646\nSo what we have is this kind of explorer,\n\n00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.281\nwhere we have managed to match,\nI think, around 4,000 labels.\n\n00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:31.469\nAnd we haven't really\ndone anything special here,\n\n00:12:31.493 --> 00:12:33.151\njust fed the collection.\n\n00:12:33.175 --> 00:12:34.945\nAnd we found interesting categories.\n\n00:12:34.969 --> 00:12:37.874\nWe can start with horses,\na very straightforward category.\n\n00:12:37.898 --> 00:12:40.197\nYou would expect to see\nthat the machine has put\n\n00:12:40.221 --> 00:12:41.962\nimages of horses, right?\n\n00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:45.428\nAnd it has, but you also notice,\nright over there,\n\n00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:47.531\nthat it has a very abstract image\n\n00:12:47.555 --> 00:12:50.750\nthat it has still managed to recognize\nand cluster as horses.\n\n00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:54.464\nWe also have an amazing head\nin terms of a horse.\n\n00:12:54.488 --> 00:12:58.490\nAnd each one has the tags\nas to why it got categorized in this.\n\n00:12:58.514 --> 00:13:02.488\nSo let's move to another one\nwhich I found very funny and interesting,\n\n00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:05.003\nbecause I don't understand\nhow this category came up.\n\n00:13:05.027 --> 00:13:06.777\nIt's called \"Lady in Waiting.\"\n\n00:13:06.801 --> 00:13:09.413\nIf, Cyril, you do it very quickly,\n\n00:13:09.437 --> 00:13:12.979\nyou will see that we have\nthese amazing images\n\n00:13:13.003 --> 00:13:15.764\nof ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.\n\n00:13:15.788 --> 00:13:17.234\nI don't really understand it.\n\n00:13:17.258 --> 00:13:19.498\nBut I've been trying to ask\nmy museum contacts,\n\n00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:21.767\nyou know, \"What is this?\nWhat's going on here?\"\n\n00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:23.403\nAnd it's fascinating.\n\n00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:26.116\nComing back to gold very quickly,\n\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.703\nI wanted to search for gold\n\n00:13:27.727 --> 00:13:29.829\nand see how the machine\ntagged all the gold.\n\n00:13:29.853 --> 00:13:31.933\nBut, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.\n\n00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.793\nWe are living in popular times.\n\n00:13:33.817 --> 00:13:35.920\nIt tags it as \"bling-bling.\"\n\n00:13:35.944 --> 00:13:37.758\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:39.158 --> 00:13:42.079\nI'm being hard on Cyril,\nbecause I'm moving too fast.\n\n00:13:42.103 --> 00:13:44.730\nEssentially, here you have\nall the bling-bling\n\n00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:47.915\nof the world's museums organized for you.\n\n00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:51.455\nAnd finally, to end this talk\nand these experiments,\n\n00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:54.796\nwhat I hope you feel after this talk\nis happiness and emotion.\n\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.259\nAnd what would we see\nwhen we see happiness?\n\n00:13:57.283 --> 00:14:00.442\nIf we actually look at all the objects\n\n00:14:00.466 --> 00:14:02.410\nthat have been tagged under \"happiness,\"\n\n00:14:02.434 --> 00:14:05.498\nyou would expect happiness, I guess.\n\n00:14:05.522 --> 00:14:11.625\nBut there was one that came up\nthat was very fascinating and interesting,\n\n00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:16.024\nwhich was this

"https://www.ted.com/talks/shaolan_the_chinese_zodiac_explained", "transcript": "Have you ever been asked by your Chinese friend, \"What is your zodiac sign?\" Don't think they are making small talk. If you say, \"I'm a Monkey,\" they immediately know you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.(Laughter) Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age.By revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated. Judgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune, your personality, career prospects and how you will do in a given year. If you share you and your partner's animal signs, they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life. Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac. As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it, you'd be wise to do something about that.So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly? Most Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac, the signs divided into 12 months. The Chinese zodiac is different. It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals, starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig, and has no association with constellations. For example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit. Can you see your zodiac sign there? Our Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals. Over thousands of years, this popular culture has affected people's major decisions, such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other. And some of the implications are quite amazing.The Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others. So parents choose specific years to give birth to babies, because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families. We even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations. I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits. Chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies. As a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake. Raise your hand if you are a Snake. Let's have a chat later.(Laughter)We believe some animals are luckier than the others, such as the Dragon. Unlike the Western tradition, the Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth. It's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby. Jack Ma's parents must have been very proud. And they are not the only ones. In 2012, the Year of the Dragon, the birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan increased by five percent. That means another one million more babies. With a traditional preference to baby boys, the boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100. When those Dragon boys grow up, they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets.According to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release, January 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections. Why? That was the last month for the Year of the Horse. It's not because they like horses so much, it's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies.(Laughter)If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad. Those are Goat babies. They don't look like losers to me.(Laughter)Tiger is another undesirable animal, due to its volatile temperament. Many Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate during those years. Perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse, as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition. Maybe they are the lucky ones. I went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world, and it's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger, are at the top of the chart, even higher than the Dragon. So maybe we should consider, maybe it's much better to have less competition.One last but interesting point: many Chinese people make their investment decisions based on the zodiac sign index. Although the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years, the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades. Our ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought, famine, riot, disease and civil war. And finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology to create an ideal life they've always wanted. The collective decision made by 1.3 billion people has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything, from health care and education to property and consumer goods. As China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics, the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world.Are there any Monkeys here? 2016 is the Year of the Monkey.

"transcript": "Today 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy. Too poor to pay their way through college, they now owe lenders more than one trillion US dollars. They do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt that is secured on their person. In America, even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance. But it is nearly impossible for an American to get discharged their student loan debts.Once upon a time in America, going to college did not mean graduating with debt. My friend Paul's father graduated from Colorado State University on the GI Bill. For his generation, higher education was free or almost free, because it was thought of as a public good. Not anymore. When Paul also graduated from Colorado State University, he paid for his English degree by working part-time. 30 years ago, higher education tuition was affordable, reasonable, and what debts you accumulated, you paid off by graduation date. Not anymore. Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps, but with one difference: when she graduated five years ago, it was with a whopping debt.Students like Kate have to take on a loan because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable for many if not most American families. But so what? Getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it. But that's where the rubber meets the road. Even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013.So ... tuition costs up, public funding down, family incomes diminished, personal incomes weak. Is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must cannot make their student loan payments? The worst of times can be the best of times, because certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore. I want to speak of three of them today.1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy. All of us talk about education just as the economists do now, as an investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work. As an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily. The U.S. News & World Report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines. The language is peppered with barbarisms. Teachers are called \"service providers,\" students are called \"consumers.\" Sociology and Shakespeare and soccer and science, all of these are \"content.\"Student debt is profitable. Only not on you. Your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry. The two 800-pound gorillas of which \u2014 Sallie Mae and Navient \u2014 posted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars. And just like home mortgages, student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced, and sold on Wall Street. And colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans profit twice. Once from your tuition, and then again from the interest on debt.With all that money to be made, are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising, in bait and switch ... in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate?Third: diplomas are a brand. Many years ago my teacher wrote, \"When students are treated as consumers, they're made prisoners of addiction and envy.\" Just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone, so also people can be sold more and more education. College is the new high school, we already say that. But why stop there? People can be upsold on certifications and recertifications, master's degrees, doctoral degrees.Higher education is also marketed as a status object. Buy a degree, much like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag, to distinguish yourself from others. So you can be the object of envy of others. Diplomas are a brand.But these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch. There is not a day that goes by without some policy guy on television telling us, \"A college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator to a middle-class life.\" And the usual evidence offered is the college premium: a college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad.Let's look at that number more carefully, because on the face of it, it seems to belie the stories we all hear about college grads working as baristas and cashiers. Of 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education, 45 do not complete it in a timely fashion, for a number of reasons, including financial. Of the 55 that do graduate, two will remain unemployed, and another 18 are underemployed. So, college grads earn more than high school grads, but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college?Now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it. But that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone, for decades now. For decades, workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced. And had they received as they should have, then going to college would have been a bad investment for many. College premium? I think it's a high school discount.Two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job. And the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising \u2014 in fact, it's downright bleak. And it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt. And it is they, curiously and sadly, who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing. That's not just cynical marketing, that's cruel.So what do we do? What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product? Everybody else seems to. Then, like any other consumer product, you would demand to know what you're paying for. When you buy medicines, you get a list of side effects. When you buy a higher educational product, you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose, make informed choices. When you buy a car, it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect. Who knows what to expect from a degree say, in Canadian Studies. There is such a thing, by the way.What if there was an app for that? One that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income. Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT. One of you make this.(Laughter)Discover your reality.(Laughter)There are three advantages, three benefits to Income-Based Tuition. Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major. Such informed users are unlikely to fall victim to the huckster's ploy, to the sales pitch. But also to choose wisely. Why would anybody pay more for college than let's say, 15 percent of the additional income they earn?There's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition. By tying the cost to the income, college administrators would be forced to manage costs better, to find innovative ways to do so. For instance, all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major. That is manifestly unfair, and should change. An engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student. But the philosophy student, as a consequence, is subsidizing the engineering student. Who then, by the way, goes on and earns more money. Why should two people buy the same product, pay the same, but one person receive half or a third of the service. In fact, college grads, some majors, pay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt, while others pay five percent. That kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly.Now of course, all this data \u2014 and one of you is going to do this, right? All this data has to be well designed, maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies. We know about statistics, right?But be that as it may, the third and biggest benefit of Income-Based Tuition, is it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin because they bought a defective product.Perhaps, in time, young and old Americans may rediscover, as the gentleman said earlier, their curiosity, their love of learning \u2014 begin to study what they love, love what they study, follow their passion ... getting stimulated by their intelligence, follow paths of inquiry that they really want to.After all, it was Eric and Kevin, two years ago, just exactly these kinds of young men, who prompted me and worked with me, and still do, in the study of indebted students in America.Thank you for your attention.(Applause)", "id": 2523, "subtitle":

education was free or almost free,\n\n00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.385\nbecause it was thought of\nas a public good.\n\n00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:16.830\nNot anymore.\n\n00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:22.225\nWhen

families.\n\n00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:57.535\nBut so what?\n\n00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:00.623\nGetting into debt to buy\nan expensive education\n\n00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:03.409\nis not all bad if you

00:02:59.654\nthat higher education\nis a consumer product you can buy.\n\n00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:05.059\nAll of us talk about education\njust as the economists do now,\n\n00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:09.564\nas an investment that you make\nto improve the human stock\n\n00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:11.329\nby training them for work.\n\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.493\nAs an investment you make\nto sort and classify people\n\n00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:19.285\nso that employers\ncan hire them more easily.\n\n00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:23.752\nThe U.S. News &amp; World Report\nranks colleges\n\n00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:27.029\njust as the consumer report\nrates washing machines.\n\n00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:30.816\nThe language is peppered with barbarisms.\n\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.221\nTeachers are called \"service providers,\"\n\n00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:35.998\nstudents are called \"consumers.\"\n\n00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:41.348\nSociology and Shakespeare\nand soccer

you.\n\n00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.522\nYour debt fattens the profit\nof the student loan industry.\n\n00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:56.435\nThe two 800-pound gorillas of which --\n\n00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.522\nSallie Mae and Navient --\n\n00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:03.752\nposted last year a combined profit\nof 1.2 billion dollars.\n\n00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:07.098\nAnd just like home mortgages,\n\n00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.308\nstudent loans can be bundled\nand packaged and sliced and diced,\n\n00:04:10.332 --> 00:04:11.582\nand sold on Wall Street.\n\n00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:13.923\nAnd colleges and universities\n\n00:04:13.947 --> 00:04:17.247\nthat invest in these securitized loans\n\n00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:19.279\nprofit twice.\n\n00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.114\nOnce from your tuition,\n\n00:04:21.138 --> 00:04:23.518\nand then again from the interest on debt.\n\n00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.432\nWith all that money to be made,\n\n00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:33.043\nare we surprised that some\nin the higher education business\n\n00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:35.139\nhave begun to engage in false advertising,\n\n00:04:35.163 --> 00:04:36.320\nin bait and switch ...\n\n00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:42.638\nin exploiting the very ignorance\nthat they pretend to educate?\n\n00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:45.252\nThird:\n\n00:04:45.636 --> 00:04:47.025\ndiplomas are a brand.\n\n00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.050\nMany years ago my teacher wrote,\n\n00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:52.615\n\"When students are treated as consumers,\n\n00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.764\nthey're made prisoners\nof addiction and envy.\"\n\n00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:04.293\nJust as consumers can be sold and resold\nupgraded versions of an iPhone,\n\n00:05:04.317 --> 00:05:07.259\nso also people can be sold\nmore and more education.\n\n00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:10.631\nCollege is the new high school,\n\n00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:11.979\nwe already say that.\n\n00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:14.765\nBut why stop there?\n\n00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.266\nPeople can be upsold\non certifications and recertifications,\n\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.646\nmaster's degrees, doctoral degrees.\n\n00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:27.107\nHigher education is also marketed\nas a status object.\n\n00:05:28.592 --> 00:05:29.743\nBuy a degree,\n\n00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:32.954\nmuch like you do a Lexus\nof a Louis Vuitton bag,\n\n00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:34.772\nto distinguish yourself from others.\n\n00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:37.247\nSo you can be the object\nof envy of others.\n\n00:05:38.627 --> 00:05:40.358\nDiplomas are a brand.\n\n00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:47.587\nBut these truths are often times\nhidden by a very noisy sales pitch.\n\n00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:50.129\nThere is not a day that goes by\n\n00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:55.190\nwithout some policy guy\non television telling us,\n\n00:05:55.214 --> 00:05:57.238\n\"A college degree is absolutely essential\n\n00:05:57.262 --> 00:05:59.979\nto get on that up escalator\nto a middle-class life.\"\n\n00:06:00.848 --> 00:06:04.526\nAnd the usual evidence offered\nis the college premium:\n\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.797\na college grad who makes on average\n56 percent more than a high school grad.\n\n00:06:10.383 --> 00:06:12.431\nLet's look at that number more carefully,\n\n00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.781\nbecause on the face of it,\n\n00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:17.149\nit seems to belie the stories we all hear\n\n00:06:17.173 --> 00:06:21.561\nabout college grads\nworking as baristas and cashiers.\n\n00:06:22.503 --> 00:06:27.654\nOf 100 people who enroll\nin any form of post-secondary education,\n\n00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:30.726\n45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,\n\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.816\nfor a number of reasons,\nincluding financial.\n\n00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:36.146\nOf the 55 that do graduate,\n\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.218\ntwo will remain unemployed,\n\n00:06:38.242 --> 00:06:40.972\nand another 18 are underemployed.\n\n00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:45.691\nSo, college grads earn more\nthan high school grads,\n\n00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.708\nbut does it pay for the exorbitant tuition\n\n00:06:48.732 --> 00:06:51.123\nand the lost wages while at college?\n\n00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.215\nNow even economists admit\n\n00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:59.469\ngoing to college pays off\nfor only those who complete it.\n\n00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:04.085\nBut that's only because high school wages\nhave been cut to the bone,\n\n00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:05.549\nfor decades now.\n\n00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.216\nFor decades,\n\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.597\nworkers with a high school degree\n\n00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:15.724\nhave been denied a fair share\nof what they have produced.\n\n00:07:16.438 --> 00:07:19.343\nAnd had they received as they should have,\n\n00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:23.320\nthen going to college would have been\na bad investment for many.\n\n00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:25.470\nCollege premium?\n\n00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.653\nI think it's a high school discount.\n\n00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:33.050\nTwo out of three people who enroll\nare not going to find an adequate job.\n\n00:07:33.714 --> 00:07:36.825\nAnd the future, for them,\ndoesn't look particularly promising --\n\n00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:38.571\nin fact, it's downright bleak.\n\n00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:40.999\nAnd it is they who are going to suffer\n\n00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:45.182\nthe most punishing forms of student debt.\n\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.111\nAnd it is they,\n\n00:07:47.135 --> 00:07:48.516\ncuriously and sadly,\n\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.349\nwho are marketed most loudly\nabout this college premium thing.\n\n00:07:53.944 --> 00:07:56.341\nThat's not just cynical marketing,\n\n00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:57.515\nthat's cruel.\n\n00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:00.385\nSo what do we do?\n\n00:08:01.237 --> 00:08:06.846\nWhat if students and parents treated\nhigher education as a consumer product?\n\n00:08:08.157 --> 00:08:09.696\nEverybody else seems to.\n\n00:08:10.644 --> 00:08:12.906\nThen, like any other consumer product,\n\n00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.429\nyou would demand to know\nwhat you're paying for.\n\n00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:16.668\nWhen you buy medicines,\n\n00:08:16.692 --> 00:08:18.607\nyou get a list of side effects.\n\n00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.743\nWhen you buy a higher educational product,\n\n00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:22.401\nyou should have a warning label\n\n00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:24.617\nthat allows consumers to choose,\n\n00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:26.020\nmake informed choices.\n\n00:08:26.796 --> 00:08:27.988\nWhen you buy a car,\n\n00:08:28.012 --> 00:08:30.623\nit tells you how many\nmiles per gallon to expect.\n\n00:08:31.146 --> 00:08:32.592\nWho knows what to expect\n\n00:08:32.616 --> 00:08:36.330\nfrom a degree say, in Canadian Studies.\n\n00:08:36.764 --> 00:08:38.423\nThere is such a thing, by the way.\n\n00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:43.002\nWhat if there was an app for that?\n\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.228\nOne that linked up the cost of a major\nto the expected income.\n\n00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.532\nLet's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.\n\n00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:56.078\nOne of you make this.\n\n00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:57.641\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:57.665 --> 00:08:59.397\nDiscover your reality.\n\n00:08:59.421 --> 00:09:01.730\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:03.183\nThere are three advantages,\n\n00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:05.888\nthree benefits to Income-Based Tuition.\n\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.079\nAny user can figure out\n\n00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:12.307\nhow much money he or she will make\nfrom a given college and major.\n\n00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:14.405\nSuch informed users\n\n00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:18.374\nare unlikely to fall victim\nto the huckster's ploy,\n\n00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:19.808\nto the sales pitch.\n\n00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:21.538\nBut also to choose wisely.\n\n00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:23.964\nWhy would anybody pay more for college\n\n00:09:23.988 --> 00:09:27.014\nthan let's say, 15 percent\nof the additional income they earn?\n\n00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:31.714\nThere's a second benefit\nto Income-Based Tuition.\n\n00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.698\nBy tying the cost to the income,\n\n00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:39.143\ncollege administrators would be forced\nto manage costs better,\n\n00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:41.507\nto find innovative ways to do so.\n\n00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:42.685\nFor instance,\n\n00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:46.769\nall of you students here pay roughly\nthe same tuition for every major.\n\n00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:51.483\nThat is manifestly unfair,\nand should change.\n\n00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:56.174\nAn engineering student uses more resources\n\n00:09:56.198 --> 00:09:58.607\nand facilities and labs and faculty\n\n00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.309\nthan a

"duration": "485", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/negin_farsad_a_highly_scientific_taxonomy_of_haters", "transcript": "I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female, like all of you. And I'm also a social justice comedian, something that I insist is an actual job.To explain what that is, let me tell you how I got here. I've performed all over the country. And let me tell you, America is majestic, right? It's got breathtaking nature, waffle houses and diabetes as far as the eye can see. It is really something.Now, the American population can be broken up into three main categories: there's mostly wonderful people, haters and Florida.(Laughter)Besides Florida, the most troubling category here are the Haters. They are a minority, but they overcompensate by being extra loud. They have the Napoleon complex of demographics, and yes, some of the men do wear heels.As a social justice comedian, it's my goal to convert these haters, because they hate a lot of things, which leads to negative outcomes, like racism, violence and Ted Nugent. This is not an exhaustive list; I'm probably missing 3-7 items.But the point is, we have to reckon with the haters. But there's variance within this group and it's not efficient to go after all of them, right? So what I've done is created a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters. I basically took all of the haters, I put them in a petri dish, like a scientist, and this is what I found.(Laughter)First off, we have the trolls. These are your garden-variety digital haters. They're the people who quit their jobs so they can post on YouTube videos all day long. There's also the drive-by haters. Now, these people will be at a stoplight, they'll wait for the light to turn green and when it does, they yell, \"Go back to your own country!\" Now back in the day, they would've actually gotten out of their cars and hated you to your face. But they just don't make them like they used to \u2014 which is another sign of the decline in America.(Laughter)The next category is the mission-oriented-bigot- whose-group-affiliation- gives-them-cover-for-hating hater. These guys like to hate via a seemingly nice organization, like a church or a nonprofit, and they oftentimes like to speak in an old-timey voice.But the group I'm most interested in is the swing hater. The swing hater is sister to the swing voter \u2014 they just can't decide! They're like ideological sluts who move from hating to not hating. And they do it because they don't have enough information. This is the group I like to target with social justice comedy. Why comedy? Because on a scale of comedy to brochure, the average American prefers comedy, as you can see from this graph.(Laughter)Comedy is very popular. And by the way, this is a mathematically accurate graph, generated from fake numbers.(Laughter)Now, the question is: Why does social justice comedy work? Because, first off, it makes you laugh. And when you're laughing, you enter into a state of openness. And in that moment of openness, a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information, and if they're really skilled, a rectal exam.(Laughter)Here are some ground rules for social justice comedy: first off, it's not partisan. This isn't political comedy, this is about justice, and no one is against justice. Two, it's inviting and warm, it makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito. Three, it's funny but sneaky, like you could be hearing an interesting treatise on income inequality, that's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke.(Laughter)Here's how I see social justice comedy working. A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch of Muslim-American comedians \u2014 in a non-violent way \u2014(Laughter)And we went around the country to places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia \u2014 places where they love the Muzzies \u2014 and we did stand-up shows. We called the tour \"The Muslims Are Coming!\"(Laughter)We turned this into a movie, and then after the movie came out, a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars on an anti-Muslim poster campaign with the MTA \u2014 that's the New York City subway system. Now, the posters were truly offensive, not to mentioned poorly designed \u2014 I mean, if you're going to be bigoted, you might as well use a better font.(Laughter)But we decided, why not launch our own poster campaign that says nice things about Muslims, while promoting the movie. So myself and fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah decided to launch the fighting-bigotry- with-delightful-posters campaign. We raised the money, worked with the MTA for over 5 months, got the posters approved, and two days after they were supposed to go up, the MTA decided to ban the posters, citing political content.Let's take a look at a couple of those posters. Here's one. Facts about Muslims: Muslims invented the concept of a hospital. OK. Fact: Grown-up Muslims can do more push-ups than baby Muslims.(Laughter)Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.(Laughter)Let's take a look at another one. The ugly truth about Muslims: they have great frittata recipes.Now clearly, frittatas are considered political by the MTA. Either that, or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political \u2014 but it isn't. It's about justice. So we decided to change our fighting-bigortry- with-delightful-posters campaign and turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.(Laughter)So basically, what I'm saying is a couple of dirt-bag comedians took on a major New York City agency and the comedians won.(Applause and cheers)Thank you. Victory was a very weird feeling. I was like, \"Is this what blonde girls feel like all the time? 'Cause this is amazing!\"(Laughter)Here's another example. I'm asked everywhere I go: \"Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?\" We do. But OK, I'll take the bait. So I decided to launch thedailydenouncer.com. It's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week, while taking the weekends off. Let's take a look at an example. They generally appear as single-panel cartoons, \"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce people who never fill the paper tray!\" The point of the website is that it denounces terrorism while recognizing that it's ridiculous that we have to constantly denounce terrorism.But if bigotry isn't your thing, social justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues. For example, myself and fellow comedian Lee Camp went to the Cayman Islands to investigate offshore banking. Now, the United States loses something like 300 billion dollars a year in these offshore tax havens. Not to brag, but at the end of every month, I have something like 5-15 dollars in disposable income. So we walked into these banks in the Cayman Islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and 27 cents.(Laughter)The bank managers would indulge us for 30-45 seconds before calling security. Security would come out, brandish their weapons, and then we would squeal with fear and run away, because \u2014 and this is the last rule of social justice comedy \u2014 sometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants.Most of my work is meant to be fun. It's meant to generate a connection and laughter. But yes, sometimes I get run off the grounds by security. Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail. Sometimes I get voice mails saying that if I continue telling my jokes, they'll kill me and they'll kill my family. And those death threats are definitely not funny.But despite the occasional danger, I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons. I mean, we've tried a lot of approaches to social justice, like war and competitive ice dancing. But still, a lot of things are still kind of awful. So I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2521, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:15.783 -->

00:04:36.791\ndecided to launch the fighting-bigotry-\nwith-delightful-posters campaign.\n\n00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:40.565\nWe raised the money, worked\nwith the MTA for over 5 months,\n\n00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:41.900\ngot the posters approved,\n\n00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:44.803\nand two days after they\nwere supposed to go up,\n\n00:04:44.827 --> 00:04:47.974\nthe MTA decided to ban the posters,\n\n00:04:47.998 --> 00:04:49.834\nciting political content.\n\n00:04:49.858 --> 00:04:52.091\nLet's take a look\nat a couple of those posters.\n\n00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:53.409\nHere's one.\n\n00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:54.647\nFacts about Muslims:\n\n00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:56.768\nMuslims invented\nthe concept of a hospital.\n\n00:04:56.792 --> 00:04:57.943\nOK.\n\n00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:01.974\nFact: Grown-up Muslims can do\nmore push-ups than baby Muslims.\n\n00:05:01.998 --> 00:05:03.537\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:03.561 --> 00:05:06.409\nFact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.\n\n00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:07.512\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:09.418\nLet's take a look at another one.\n\n00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:10.871\nThe ugly truth about Muslims:\n\n00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:13.483\nthey have great frittata recipes.\n\n00:05:13.507 --> 00:05:18.014\nNow clearly, frittatas are considered\npolitical by the MTA.\n\n00:05:18.038 --> 00:05:21.495\nEither that, or the mere mention\nof Muslims in a positive light\n\n00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.543\nwas considered political -- but it isn't.\n\n00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:24.820\nIt's about justice.\n\n00:05:24.844 --> 00:05:26.003\nSo we decided to change\n\n00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:28.635\nour fighting-bigortry-\nwith-delightful-posters campaign\n\n00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.138\nand turn it into the fighting-bigotry-\nwith-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.\n\n00:05:32.182 --> 00:05:33.797\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:36.785\nSo basically, what I'm saying\nis a couple of dirt-bag comedians\n\n00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.340\ntook on a major New York City agency\n\n00:05:39.364 --> 00:05:40.904\nand the comedians won.\n\n00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:43.504\n(Applause and cheers)\n\n00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:44.679\nThank you.\n\n00:05:44.703 --> 00:05:46.426\nVictory was a very weird feeling.\n\n00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.386\nI was like, \"Is this what\nblonde girls feel like all the time?\n\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.729\n'Cause this is amazing!\"\n\n00:05:50.753 --> 00:05:52.753\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.151\nHere's another example.\n\n00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:59.186\nI'm asked everywhere I go:\n\"Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?\"\n\n00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.401\nWe do. But OK, I'll take the bait.\n\n00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:04.071\nSo I decided to launch\nthedailydenouncer.com.\n\n00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:07.055\nIt's a website that denounces\nterrorism every day of the week,\n\n00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.560\nwhile taking the weekends off.\n\n00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:10.942\nLet's take a look at an example.\n\n00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:13.363\nThey generally appear\nas single-panel cartoons,\n\n00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:17.806\n\"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce\npeople who never fill the paper tray!\"\n\n00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.645\nThe point of the website\nis that it denounces terrorism\n\n00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.805\nwhile recognizing that it's ridiculous\n\n00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:25.590\nthat we have to constantly\ndenounce terrorism.\n\n00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:27.865\nBut if bigotry isn't your thing,\n\n00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.280\nsocial justice comedy is useful\nfor all sorts of issues.\n\n00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:34.195\nFor example, myself and fellow\ncomedian Lee Camp\n\n00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.684\nwent to the Cayman Islands\nto investigate offshore banking.\n\n00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:42.613\nNow, the United States loses\nsomething like 300 billion dollars a year\n\n00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:44.462\nin these offshore tax havens.\n\n00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:45.740\nNot to brag,\n\n00:06:45.764 --> 00:06:47.232\nbut at the end of every month,\n\n00:06:47.256 --> 00:06:49.900\nI have something like 5-15 dollars\nin disposable income.\n\n00:06:49.924 --> 00:06:52.396\nSo we walked into these banks\nin the Cayman Islands\n\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.576\nand asked if we could\nopen up a bank account\n\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.646\nwith eight dollars and 27 cents.\n\n00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.473\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:58.497 --> 00:07:03.928\nThe bank managers would indulge us\nfor 30-45 seconds before calling security.\n\n00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:06.524\nSecurity would come out,\nbrandish their weapons,\n\n00:07:06.548 --> 00:07:09.318\nand then we would squeal\nwith fear and run away,\n\n00:07:09.342 --> 00:07:12.371\nbecause -- and this is the last\nrule of social justice comedy --\n\n00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:15.109\nsometimes it makes you want\nto take a dump in your pants.\n\n00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.980\nMost of my work is meant to be fun.\n\n00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:21.091\nIt's meant to generate\na connection and laughter.\n\n00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:24.447\nBut yes, sometimes I get\nrun off the grounds by security.\n\n00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:27.438\nSometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.\n\n00:07:27.462 --> 00:07:32.337\nSometimes I get voice mails saying\nthat if I continue telling my jokes,\n\n00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:35.423\nthey'll kill me\nand they'll kill my family.\n\n00:07:35.447 --> 00:07:39.221\nAnd those death threats\nare definitely not funny.\n\n00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.379\nBut despite the occasional danger,\n\n00:07:41.403 --> 00:07:45.303\nI still think that social justice comedy\nis one of our best weapons.\n\n00:07:45.327 --> 00:07:48.382\nI mean, we've tried\na lot of approaches to social justice,\n\n00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:50.928\nlike war and competitive ice dancing.\n\n00:07:50.952 --> 00:07:54.802\nBut still, a lot of things\nare still kind of awful.\n\n00:07:55.223 --> 00:07:58.465\nSo I think it's time we try and tell\na really good poop joke.\n\n00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:00.142\nThank you.\n\n00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:04.458\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "3 reasons why we can win the fight against poverty", "duration": "794", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_youn_3_reasons_why_we_can_win_the_fight_against_poverty", "transcript": "I've been living in rural East Africa for about 10 years, and I want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty. I believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we've left more than one billion of our members behind. Hungry, extreme poverty: these often seem like gigantic, insurmountable problems, too big to solve. But as a field practitioner, I believe these are actually very solvable problems if we just take the right strategies.Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker, and he taught us that if we lean on the right levers, we can move the world. In the fight against extreme poverty, I believe there are three powerful levers that we can lean on. This talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty a winnable fight in our lifetimes.What is extreme poverty? When I first moved to rural East Africa, I stayed overnight with a farm family. They were wonderful people. They invited me into their home. We sang songs together and ate a simple dinner. They gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor. In the morning, however, there was nothing to eat. And then at lunchtime, I watched with an increasingly sick feeling as the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch. For that meal, every child drank one cup to survive. And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt when they handed one of those cups to me, and I knew I had to accept their hospitality.Children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally. Every day they fail to eat, they lose a little bit of their future. Amongst the extreme poor, one in three children are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough. When that's combined with poor access to health care, one in 10 extremely poor children die before they reach age five. And only one quarter of children complete high school because they lack school fees. Hunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way. We see ourselves as a thinking, feeling and moral human race, but until we solve these problems for all of our members, we fail that standard, because every person on this planet matters. This child matters. These children matter. This girl matters.You know, we see things like this, and we're upset by them, but they seem like such big problems. We don't know how to take effective action. But remember our friend Archimedes. Global poverty has powerful levers. It's a problem like any other. I live and work in the field, and as a practitioner, I believe these are very solvable problems. So for the next 10 minutes, let's not be sad about the state of the world. Let's engage our brains. Let's engage our collective passion for problem-solving and figure out what those levers are.Lever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers. Think about how extraordinary this is. If this picture represents the world's poor, then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income. This gets me really excited. All of these people, one profession. Think how powerful this is. When farmers become more productive, then more than half the world's poor earn more money and climb out of poverty. And it gets better. The product of farming is, of course, food. So when farmers become more productive, they earn more food, and they don't just help themselves, but they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies. And when farmers become more productive, they reduce environmental pressure. We only have two ways we can feed the world: we can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive, or we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland, which would be environmentally disastrous. Farmers are basically a really important leverage point. When farmers become more productive, they earn more income, they climb out of poverty, they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure. Farmers stand at the center of the world.And not a farmer like this one, but rather this lady. Most of the farmers I know are actually women. Look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman. She is physically strong, mentally tough, and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children. If we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands, then I'm really glad it's her.(Applause)There's just one problem: many smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge. Currently, they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year, they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe. These are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age, and it's why many farmers are still very poor.But good news, again. Lever number two: humanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago. Let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming. First, hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together. If you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety together with a drought-resistant variety, you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents. Next, conventional fertilizer, if used responsibly, is environmentally sustainable. If you micro-dose just a pinch of fertilizer to a plant that's taller than I am, you unlock enormous yield gain. These are known as farm inputs. Farm inputs need to be combined with good practice. When you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost, farmers multiply their harvests. These proven tools and practices have more than tripled agricultural productivity in every major region of the world, moving mass numbers of people out of poverty. We just haven't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.So overall, this is amazing news. Humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago, in theory. We just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet. In this century, the reason that people remain poor is because maybe they live in remote places. They lack access to these things. Therefore, ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people. We don't need more genius types right now. The humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime.So these are the three levers, and the most powerful lever is simply delivery. Wherever the world's companies, governments and nonprofits set up delivery networks for life-improving goods, we eliminate poverty.OK, so that sounds really nice in theory, but what about in practice? What do these delivery networks look like? I want to share the concrete example that I know best, my organization, One Acre Fund. We only serve the farmer, and our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed. We start off by delivering farm inputs to really rural places. Now, this may appear initially very challenging, but it's pretty possible. Let me show you. We buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network, and store it in 20 warehouses like this. Then, during input delivery, we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks and send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field. They then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms. It's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers. Importantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, a way to pay. Farmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses. And then we surround all that with training. Our rural field officers deliver practical, hands-on training to farmers in the field every two weeks.Wherever we deliver our services, farmers use these tools to climb out of poverty. This is a farmer in our program, Consolata. Look at the pride on her face. She has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet. Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.(Applause)The key to doing this is scalable delivery. In any given area, we hire a rural field officer who delivers our services to 200 farmers, on average, with more than 1,000 people living in those families. Today, we have 2,000 of these rural field officers growing very quickly. This is our delivery army, and we're just one organization. There are many companies, governments and nonprofits that have delivery armies just like this. And I believe we stand at a moment in time where collectively, we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers.Let me show you how possible this is. This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa, with a map of the United States for scale. I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because this is a huge delivery territory. It's very challenging. But we analyzed every 50-mile by 50-mile block on the continent, and we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions. That's a remarkably small area overall. If you were to lay these boxes next to each other within a map of the United States, they would only cover the Eastern United States. You can order pizza anywhere in this territory and it'll arrive to your house hot, fresh and delicious. If America can deliver pizza to an area of this size, then Africa's companies, governments and non-profits can deliver farm services to all of her farmers. This is possible.I'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming. In every field of human development, humanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty. We just need to deliver them. So again, in every area of human development, super-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive, highly effective tools. Humanity is armed to the teeth with simple, effective solutions to poverty. We just need to deliver these to a pretty small area. Again using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example, remember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas. Urban poverty is even more concentrated, in these green little dots. Again, using a map of the United States for scale, this is what I would call a highly achievable delivery zone. In fact, for the first time in human history, we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us. The world's companies, governments and non-profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this relatively small area. We just lack the will.If we are willing, every one of us has a role to play. We first need more people to pursue careers in human development, especially if you live in a developing nation. We need more front line health workers, teachers, farmer trainers, sales agents for life-improving goods. These are the delivery people that dedicate their careers to improving the lives of others. But we also need a lot of support roles. These are roles available at just my organization alone, and we're just one out of many. This may surprise you, but no matter what your technical specialty, there is a role for you in this fight. And no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty, we need a lot more resources. This is our number one constraint. For private investors, we need a big expansion of venture capital, private equity, working capital, available in emerging markets. But there are also limits to what private business can accomplish. Private businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor, so philanthropy still has a major role to play. Anybody can give, but we need more leadership. We need more visionary philanthropists and global leaders who will take problems in human development and lead humanity to wipe them off the face of the planet. If you're interested in these ideas, check out this website.We need more leaders. Humanity has put people on the moon. We've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets and connect us with anybody on the planet. We've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace. We are an exceptional people. But we've left more than one billion of our members behind. Until every girl like this one has an opportunity to earn her full human potential, we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race. Logistically speaking, it's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty. We just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody. If we have the will, every one of us has a role to play. Let's deploy our time, our careers, our collective wealth. Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty in this lifetime.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2522, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.124 -->

possible way.\n\n00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:17.019\nWe see ourselves as a thinking,\nfeeling and moral human race,\n\n00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:20.078\nbut until we solve these problems\nfor all of our members,\n\n00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:21.787\nwe fail that standard,\n\n00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.632\nbecause every person\non this planet matters.\n\n00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:26.448\nThis child matters.\n\n00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.842\nThese children matter.\n\n00:02:29.596 --> 00:02:31.400\nThis girl matters.\n\n00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:33.856\nYou know, we see things like this,\n\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.457\nand we're upset by them,\n\n00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.283\nbut they seem like such big problems.\n\n00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:40.142\nWe don't know how\nto take effective action.\n\n00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:42.748\nBut remember our friend Archimedes.\n\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.858\nGlobal poverty has powerful levers.\n\n00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:47.471\nIt's a problem like any other.\n\n00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:50.427\nI live and work in the field,\nand as a practitioner,\n\n00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.254\nI believe these are very\nsolvable problems.\n\n00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:54.759\nSo for the next 10 minutes,\n\n00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:56.937\nlet's not be sad\nabout the state of the world.\n\n00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:58.461\nLet's engage our brains.\n\n00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:01.561\nLet's engage our collective passion\nfor problem-solving\n\n00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:03.774\nand figure out what those levers are.\n\n00:03:04.374 --> 00:03:07.527\nLever number one: most\nof the world's poor are farmers.\n\n00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:10.178\nThink about how extraordinary this is.\n\n00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:12.663\nIf this picture represents\nthe world's poor,\n\n00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:15.992\nthen more than half engage in farming\nas a major source of income.\n\n00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:18.253\nThis gets me really excited.\n\n00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:20.629\nAll of these people, one profession.\n\n00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:22.661\nThink how powerful this is.\n\n00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:26.203\nWhen farmers become more productive,\nthen more than half the world's poor\n\n00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:28.631\nearn more money and climb out of poverty.\n\n00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:29.875\nAnd it gets better.\n\n00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:32.154\nThe product of farming\nis, of course, food.\n\n00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:35.783\nSo when farmers become more productive,\nthey earn more food,\n\n00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:37.528\nand they don't just help themselves,\n\n00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:40.778\nbut they help to feed healthy communities\nand thriving economies.\n\n00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:44.759\nAnd when farmers become more productive,\nthey reduce environmental pressure.\n\n00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.683\nWe only have two ways\nwe can feed the world:\n\n00:03:47.707 --> 00:03:51.030\nwe can either make our existing farmland\na lot more productive,\n\n00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:54.334\nor we can clear cut forest and savannah\nto make more farmland,\n\n00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:56.608\nwhich would be environmentally disastrous.\n\n00:03:57.646 --> 00:04:00.958\nFarmers are basically\na really important leverage point.\n\n00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:03.387\nWhen farmers become more productive,\n\n00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:06.022\nthey earn more income,\nthey climb out of poverty,\n\n00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:10.121\nthey feed their communities and they\nreduce environmental land pressure.\n\n00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:12.790\nFarmers stand at the center of the world.\n\n00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:15.964\nAnd not a farmer like this one,\n\n00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.583\nbut rather this lady.\n\n00:04:18.013 --> 00:04:20.169\nMost of the farmers I know\nare actually women.\n\n00:04:20.657 --> 00:04:23.929\nLook at the strength and the will\nradiating from this woman.\n\n00:04:23.953 --> 00:04:26.165\nShe is physically strong, mentally tough,\n\n00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.620\nand she will do whatever it takes\nto earn a better life for her children.\n\n00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.788\nIf we're going to put the future\nof humanity in one person's hands,\n\n00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:34.625\nthen I'm really glad it's her.\n\n00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:40.059\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.339\nThere's just one problem:\n\n00:04:41.363 --> 00:04:46.106\nmany smallholder farmers\nlack access to basic tools and knowledge.\n\n00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:50.394\nCurrently, they take a little bit\nof saved food grain from the prior year,\n\n00:04:50.418 --> 00:04:53.798\nthey plant it in the ground\nand they till it with a manual hand hoe.\n\n00:04:53.822 --> 00:04:56.587\nThese are tools and techniques\nthat date to the Bronze Age,\n\n00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.549\nand it's why many farmers\nare still very poor.\n\n00:05:00.713 --> 00:05:02.095\nBut good news, again.\n\n00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:03.270\nLever number two:\n\n00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:07.660\nhumanity actually solved the problem\nof agricultural poverty a century ago.\n\n00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:11.430\nLet me walk you through the three\nmost basic factors in farming.\n\n00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:16.299\nFirst, hybrid seed is created\nwhen you cross two seeds together.\n\n00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:19.127\nIf you naturally pollinate\na high-yielding variety\n\n00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.462\ntogether with a drought-resistant variety,\n\n00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:25.324\nyou get a hybrid that inherits\npositive traits from both of its parents.\n\n00:05:25.348 --> 00:05:29.045\nNext, conventional fertilizer,\nif used responsibly,\n\n00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.868\nis environmentally sustainable.\n\n00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:34.385\nIf you micro-dose\njust a pinch of fertilizer\n\n00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.493\nto a plant that's taller than I am,\n\n00:05:36.517 --> 00:05:38.691\nyou unlock enormous yield gain.\n\n00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:40.780\nThese are known as farm inputs.\n\n00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.799\nFarm inputs need to be combined\nwith good practice.\n\n00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:47.917\nWhen you space your seeds\nand plant with massive amounts of compost,\n\n00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:50.494\nfarmers multiply their harvests.\n\n00:05:50.904 --> 00:05:53.480\nThese proven tools and practices\nhave more than tripled\n\n00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:56.552\nagricultural productivity\nin every major region of the world,\n\n00:05:56.576 --> 00:05:59.349\nmoving mass numbers of people\nout of poverty.\n\n00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:03.225\nWe just haven't finished delivering\nthese things to everybody just yet,\n\n00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:04.990\nparticularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:06:05.883 --> 00:06:07.605\nSo overall, this is amazing news.\n\n00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.185\nHumanity actually solved\nagricultural poverty a century ago,\n\n00:06:11.635 --> 00:06:12.842\nin theory.\n\n00:06:12.866 --> 00:06:15.790\nWe just haven't delivered these things\nto everybody just yet.\n\n00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:18.699\nIn this century, the reason\nthat people remain poor\n\n00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:20.929\nis because maybe they live\nin remote places.\n\n00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:23.048\nThey lack access to these things.\n\n00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:26.673\nTherefore, ending poverty\nis simply a matter\n\n00:06:26.697 --> 00:06:30.119\nof delivering proven goods\nand services to people.\n\n00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:32.441\nWe don't need more genius types right now.\n\n00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:36.914\nThe humble delivery guy is going\nto end global poverty in our lifetime.\n\n00:06:38.046 --> 00:06:39.534\nSo these are the three levers,\n\n00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:42.211\nand the most powerful lever\nis simply delivery.\n\n00:06:42.991 --> 00:06:46.278\nWherever the world's companies,\ngovernments and nonprofits\n\n00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:49.001\nset up delivery networks\nfor life-improving goods,\n\n00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:51.499\nwe eliminate poverty.\n\n00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:53.974\nOK, so that sounds really nice in theory,\n\n00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:55.288\nbut what about in practice?\n\n00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:57.314\nWhat do these delivery networks look like?\n\n00:06:57.964 --> 00:07:00.499\nI want to share the concrete example\nthat I know best,\n\n00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:02.434\nmy organization, One Acre Fund.\n\n00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:04.518\nWe only serve the farmer,\n\n00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:07.907\nand our job is to provide her\nwith the tools that she needs to succeed.\n\n00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:11.196\nWe start off by delivering farm inputs\nto really rural places.\n\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.486\nNow, this may appear\ninitially very challenging,\n\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.721\nbut it's pretty possible. Let me show you.\n\n00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:18.805\nWe buy farm inputs with the combined power\nof our farmer network,\n\n00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:21.148\nand store it in 20 warehouses like this.\n\n00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:25.572\nThen, during input delivery,\nwe rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks\n\n00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:28.434\nand send them out to where farmers\nare waiting in the field.\n\n00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.349\nThey then get their individual orders\nand walk it home to their farms.\n\n00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:34.840\nIt's kind of like Amazon\nfor rural farmers.\n\n00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:40.470\nImportantly, realistic delivery\nalso includes finance, a way to pay.\n\n00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:44.947\nFarmers pay us little by little over time,\ncovering most of our expenses.\n\n00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:47.682\nAnd then we surround\nall that with training.\n\n00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:51.760\nOur rural field officers\ndeliver practical, hands-on training\n\n00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:53.189\nto farmers in the field\n\n00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:54.758\nevery two weeks.\n\n00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:59.038\nWherever we deliver our services,\nfarmers use these tools\n\n00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.632\nto climb out of poverty.\n\n00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:03.575\nThis is a farmer\nin our program, Consolata.\n\n00:08:03.991 --> 00:08:05.834\nLook at the pride on her face.\n\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.828\nShe has achieved a modest prosperity\nthat I believe is the human right\n\n00:08:09.852 --> 00:08:12.465\nof every hardworking person on the planet.\n\n00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:18.124\nToday, I'm proud to say that we're serving\nabout 400,000 farmers like Consolata.\n\n00:08:18.148 --> 00:08:23.815\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:26.117\nThe key to doing this\nis scalable delivery.\n\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.329\nIn any given area, we hire\na rural field officer\n\n00:08:29.353 --> 00:08:32.509\nwho delivers our services\nto 200 farmers, on average,\n\n00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:35.384\nwith more than 1,000 people\nliving in those families.\n\n00:08:35.763 --> 00:08:39.194\nToday, we have 2,000\nof these rural field officers\n\n00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:40.599\ngrowing very quickly.\n\n00:08:40.623 --> 00:08:42.430\nThis is our delivery army,\n\n00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:44.616\nand we're just one organization.\n\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.804\nThere are many companies,\ngovernments and nonprofits\n\n00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.039\nthat have delivery armies just like this.\n\n00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:52.109\nAnd I believe we stand at a moment in time\n\n00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:57.036\nwhere collectively, we are capable of\ndelivering farm services to all farmers.\n\n00:08:57.713 --> 00:08:59.490\nLet me show you how possible this is.\n\n00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:01.787\nThis is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,\n\n00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:03.916\nwith a map of the United States for scale.\n\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.328\nI chose Sub-Saharan Africa because\nthis is a huge delivery territory.\n\n00:09:07.352 --> 00:09:08.525\nIt's very challenging.\n\n00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:12.859\nBut we analyzed every 50-mile\nby 50-mile block on the continent,\n\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.855\nand we found that half of farmers\nlive in just these shaded regions.\n\n00:09:19.223 --> 00:09:21.555\nThat's a remarkably small area overall.\n\n00:09:22.153 --> 00:09:24.462\nIf you were to lay these boxes\nnext to each other\n\n00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:26.122\nwithin a map of the United States,\n\n00:09:26.146 --> 00:09:28.411\nthey would only cover\nthe Eastern United States.\n\n00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:32.484\nYou can order pizza\nanywhere in this territory\n\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.941\nand it'll arrive to your house\nhot, fresh and delicious.\n\n00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:39.806\nIf America can deliver pizza\nto an area of this size,\n\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.853\nthen Africa's companies,\ngovernments and non-profits\n\n00:09:42.877 --> 00:09:45.900\ncan deliver farm services\nto all of her farmers.\n\n00:09:45.924 --> 00:09:47.207\nThis is possible.\n\n00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:51.706\nI'm going to wrap up by generalizing\nbeyond just farming.\n\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.357\nIn every field of human development,\n\n00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:58.210\nhumanity has already invented\neffective tools to end poverty.\n\n00:09:58.234 --> 00:09:59.645\nWe just need to deliver them.\n\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.521\nSo again, in every area\nof human development,\n\n00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:05.947\nsuper-smart people a long time ago\ninvented inexpensive,\n\n00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.803\nhighly effective tools.\n\n00:10:07.827 --> 00:10:09.759\nHumanity is armed to the teeth\n\n00:10:09.783 --> 00:10:13.121\nwith simple, effective\nsolutions to poverty.\n\n00:10:13.554 --> 00:10:16.326\nWe just need to deliver these\nto a pretty small area.\n\n00:10:17.224 --> 00:10:20.326\nAgain using the map\nof Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,\n\n00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.824\nremember that rural poverty is\nconcentrated in these blue shaded areas.\n\n00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:28.282\nUrban poverty is even more concentrated,\nin these green little dots.\n\n00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.756\nAgain, using a map\nof the United States for scale,\n\n00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:35.834\nthis is what I would call\na highly achievable delivery zone.\n\n00:10:36.304 --> 00:10:38.466\nIn fact, for the first time\nin human history,\n\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.989\nwe have a vast amount of delivery\ninfrastructure available to us.\n\n00:10:42.013 --> 00:10:44.737\nThe world's companies,\ngovernments and non-profits\n\n00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:46.984\nhave delivery armies\nthat are fully capable\n\n00:10:47.008 --> 00:10:49.391\nof covering this relatively small area.\n\n00:10:49.885 --> 00:10:52.010\nWe just lack the will.\n\n00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:54.282\nIf we are willing,\n\n00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:56.114\nevery one of us has a role to play.\n\n00:10:57.878 --> 00:11:01.249\nWe first need more people to pursue\ncareers in human development,\n\n00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:03.421\nespecially if you live\nin a developing nation.\n\n00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:06.931\nWe need more front

I was born in Afghanistan, just six months after the Soviets invaded, and even though I was too young to understand what was happening, I had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me.Those early experiences had a major impact on how I now think about war and conflict. I learned that when people have a fundamental issue at stake, for most of them, giving in is not an option. For these types conflicts \u2014 when people's rights are violated, when their countries are occupied, when they're oppressed and humiliated \u2014 they need a powerful way to resist and to fight back. Which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is, if people see it as their only choice, they will use it. Most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world. But we're not going to end war by telling people that violence is morally wrong. Instead, we must offer them a tool that's at least as powerful and as effective as violence.This is the work I do. For the past 13 years, I've been teaching people in some of the most difficult situations around the world how they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict. Most people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther King. But people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years. In fact, most of the rights that we have today in this country \u2014 as women, as minorities, as workers, as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment \u2014 these rights weren't handed to us. They were won by people who fought for them and who sacrificed for them. But because we haven't learned from this history, nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood.I met recently with a group of Ethiopian activists, and they told me something that I hear a lot. They said they'd already tried nonviolent action, and it hadn't worked. Years ago they held a protest. The government arrested everyone, and that was the end of that. The idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem. Because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change, on their own, they don't actually create change \u2014 at least change that is fundamental.(Laughter)Powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely ... or even not so nicely.(Laughter)Nonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent, not physically, but by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive, and then denying them those sources of power. Nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect. They can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts. And they can challenge government propaganda by creating alternative media.There are a variety of methods that can be used to do this. My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp, has identified 198 methods of nonviolent action. And protest is only one. Let me give you a recent example.Until a few months ago, Guatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials with ties to organized crime. People were generally aware of this, but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it \u2014 until one group of citizens, just 12 regular people, put out a call on Facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza, holding signs with a message: \"Renuncia YA\" \u2014 resign already. To their surprise, 30,000 people showed up. They stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country. At one point, the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings with a message: \"If you don't have the huevos\" \u2014 the balls \u2014 \"to stop corrupt candidates from running for office, you can borrow ours.\"(Laughter)(Applause)President Molina responded by vowing that he would never step down. And the activists realized that they couldn't just keep protesting and ask the president to resign. They needed to leave him no choice. So they organized a general strike, in which people throughout the country refused to work. In Guatemala City alone, over 400 businesses and schools shut their doors. Meanwhile, farmers throughout the country blocked major roads. Within five days, the president, along with dozens of other government officials, resigned already.(Applause)I've been greatly inspired by the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action in nearly every country in the world. For example, recently a group of activists in Uganda released a crate of pigs in the streets. You can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them.(Laughter)The pigs were painted the color of the ruling party. One pig was even wearing a hat, a hat that people recognized.(Laughter)Activists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines, but these isolated actions do very little if they're not part of a larger strategy. A general wouldn't march his troops into battle unless he had a plan to win the war. Yet this is how most of the world's nonviolent movements operate. Nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare, if not more. Its participants must be well-trained and have clear objectives, and its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objectives.The technique of war has been developed over thousands of years with massive resources and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding and improving how it works. Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied, and even though the number is growing, there are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it. This is dangerous, because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict are not adequate for the new challenges that we're facing.The US government recently admitted that it's in a stalemate in its war against ISIS. But what most people don't know is that people have stood up to ISIS using nonviolent action. When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014, they announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum, based on their own extremist ideology. But on the first day of school, not a single child showed up. Parents simply refused to send them. They told journalists they would rather homeschool their children than to have them brainwashed.This is an example of just one act of defiance in just one city. But what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against ISIS? What if the parents' boycott was part of a larger strategy to identify and cut off the resources that ISIS needs to function; the skilled labor needed to produce food; the engineers needed to extract and refine oil; the media infrastructure and communications networks and transportation systems, and the local businesses that ISIS relies on? It may be difficult to imagine defeating ISIS with action that is nonviolent. But it's time we challenge the way we think about conflict and the choices we have in facing it.Here's an idea worth spreading: let's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked and how we can make it more powerful, just like we do with other systems and technologies that are constantly being refined to better meet human needs. It may be that we can improve nonviolent action to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war. Violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned in the same way that bows and arrows were, because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective. With human innovation, we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful than the newest and latest technologies of war. The greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2524, "subtitle":

example,\n\n00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:17.408\nrecently a group of activists in Uganda\n\n00:05:17.432 --> 00:05:19.565\nreleased a crate of pigs in the streets.\n\n00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:23.492\nYou can see here that the police\nare confused about what to do with them.\n\n00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:24.552\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:24.576 --> 00:05:27.192\nThe pigs were painted\nthe color of the ruling party.\n\n00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:29.853\nOne pig was even wearing a hat,\n\n00:05:29.877 --> 00:05:31.757\na hat that people recognized.\n\n00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:33.342\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:34.222 --> 00:05:37.591\nActivists around the world\nare getting better at grabbing headlines,\n\n00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:40.278\nbut these isolated actions do very little\n\n00:05:40.302 --> 00:05:42.485\nif they're not part of a larger strategy.\n\n00:05:42.872 --> 00:05:45.111\nA general wouldn't march\nhis troops into battle\n\n00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:47.266\nunless he had a plan to win the war.\n\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.401\nYet this is how most of the world's\nnonviolent movements operate.\n\n00:05:50.854 --> 00:05:55.174\nNonviolent struggle is just as complex\nas military warfare,\n\n00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:56.396\nif not more.\n\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.615\nIts participants must be well-trained\nand have clear objectives,\n\n00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.471\nand its leaders must have a strategy\nof how to achieve those objectives.\n\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.466\nThe technique of war has been developed\nover thousands of years\n\n00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.037\nwith massive resources\n\n00:06:10.061 --> 00:06:13.307\nand some of our best minds\ndedicated to understanding\n\n00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:15.056\nand improving how it works.\n\n00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:20.148\nMeanwhile, nonviolent struggle\nis rarely systematically studied,\n\n00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:22.182\nand even though the number is growing,\n\n00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:25.991\nthere are still only a few dozen people\nin the world who are teaching it.\n\n00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:28.100\nThis is dangerous,\n\n00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:32.292\nbecause we now know that our old\napproaches of dealing with conflict\n\n00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:35.734\nare not adequate for the new\nchallenges that we're facing.\n\n00:06:35.758 --> 00:06:37.841\nThe US government recently admitted\n\n00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:40.778\nthat it's in a stalemate\nin its war against ISIS.\n\n00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.020\nBut what most people don't know\n\n00:06:43.044 --> 00:06:46.558\nis that people have stood up to ISIS\nusing nonviolent action.\n\n00:06:47.078 --> 00:06:50.888\nWhen ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,\n\n00:06:50.912 --> 00:06:54.643\nthey announced that they were putting\nin place a new public school curriculum,\n\n00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:56.797\nbased on their own extremist ideology.\n\n00:06:57.514 --> 00:06:59.054\nBut on the first day of school,\n\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.316\nnot a single child showed up.\n\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.002\nParents simply refused to send them.\n\n00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:08.218\nThey told journalists they would rather\nhomeschool their children\n\n00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:09.798\nthan to have them brainwashed.\n\n00:07:10.647 --> 00:07:13.656\nThis is an example\nof just one act of defiance\n\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.035\nin just one city.\n\n00:07:15.617 --> 00:07:17.062\nBut what if it was coordinated\n\n00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:19.708\nwith the dozens of other acts\nof nonviolent resistance\n\n00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:21.787\nthat have taken place against ISIS?\n\n00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:25.246\nWhat if the parents' boycott\nwas part of a larger strategy\n\n00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.496\nto identify and cut off the resources\nthat ISIS needs to function;\n\n00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.611\nthe skilled labor needed to produce food;\n\n00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:36.224\nthe engineers needed\nto extract and refine oil;\n\n00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:38.841\nthe media infrastructure\nand communications networks\n\n00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:40.838\nand transportation systems,\n\n00:07:40.862 --> 00:07:43.366\nand the local businesses\nthat ISIS relies on?\n\n00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:46.990\nIt may be difficult\nto imagine defeating ISIS\n\n00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:48.925\nwith action that is nonviolent.\n\n00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.577\nBut it's time we challenge\nthe way we think about conflict\n\n00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:55.016\nand the choices we have in facing it.\n\n00:07:56.152 --> 00:07:58.423\nHere's an idea worth spreading:\n\n00:07:58.447 --> 00:08:01.602\nlet's learn more about where\nnonviolent action has worked\n\n00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:04.143\nand how we can make it more powerful,\n\n00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:07.211\njust like we do with other\nsystems and technologies\n\n00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:10.794\nthat are constantly being refined\nto better meet human needs.\n\n00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:14.863\nIt may be that we can improve\nnonviolent action\n\n00:08:14.887 --> 00:08:18.138\nto a point where it is increasingly\nused in place of war.\n\n00:08:18.796 --> 00:08:22.871\nViolence as a tool of conflict\ncould then be abandoned\n\n00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:25.302\nin the same way that bows and arrows were,\n\n00:08:25.326 --> 00:08:28.670\nbecause we have replaced them\nwith weapons that are more effective.\n\n00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:34.264\nWith human innovation, we can make\nnonviolent struggle more powerful\n\n00:08:34.288 --> 00:08:36.912\nthan the newest and latest\ntechnologies of war.\n\n00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:42.431\nThe greatest hope for humanity\nlies not in condemning violence\n\n00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:44.818\nbut in making violence obsolete.\n\n00:08:46.323 --> 00:08:47.474\nThank you.\n\n00:08:47.498 --> 00:08:55.893\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "This scientist makes ears out of apples", "duration": "425", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_pelling_this_scientist_makes_ears_out_of_apples", "transcript": "I've got a confession. I love looking through people's garbage. Now, it's not some creepy thing. I'm usually just looking for old electronics, stuff I can take to my workshop and hack. I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives. Each one's got three different motors, so now you can build things that move. There's switches so you can turn things on and off. There's even a freaking laser, so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot.Now, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage, and some of these things have even been kind of useful. But here's the thing, for me, garbage is just a chance to play, to be creative and build things to amuse myself. This is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job. I lead a university-based biological research lab, where we value curiosity and exploration above all else. We aren't focused on any particular problem, and we're not trying to solve any particular disease. This is just a place where people can come and ask fascinating questions and find answers. And I realized a long time ago that if I challenge people to build the equipment they need out of the garbage I find, it's a great way to foster creativity. And what happened was that artists and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab. And it's not just because we value unconventional ideas, it's because we test and validate them with scientific rigor.So one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart, and I had this sudden idea: Could I treat biology like hardware? Could I dismantle a biological system, mix and match the parts and then put it back together in some new and creative way? My lab started working on this, and I want to show you the result.Can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is?Audience: Apple!Andrew Pelling: That's right \u2014 it's an apple. Now, I actually want you to notice as well that this is a lot redder than most apples. And that's because we grew human cells into it. We took a totally innocent Macintosh apple, removed all the apple cells and DNA and then implanted human cells. And what we're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold. This is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture. And these little holes that you can see, this is where all the apple cells used to be. So then we come along, we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue. What happens is, these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold.As weird as this is, it's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized. And we found in our pre-clinical work that you can implant these scaffolds into the body, and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive. This is the point when people started asking me, \"Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?\" And I'm like, \"You've come to the right place.\"(Laughter)I actually brought this up with my wife. She's a musical instrument maker, and she does a lot of wood carving for a living. So I asked her, \"Could you, like, literally carve some ears out of an apple for us?\" And she did. So I took her ears to the lab. We then started preparing them. Yeah, I know.(Laughter)It's a good lab, man.(Laughter)And then we grew cells on them. And this is the result.Listen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business. People have actually been working on this for decades. Here's the issue: commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic, because they're sourced from proprietary products, animals or cadavers. We used an apple and it cost pennies.What's also really cool here is it's not that hard to make these things. The equipment you need can be built from garbage, and the key processing step only requires soap and water. So what we did was put all the instructions online as open source. And then we founded a mission-driven company, and we're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home. What I'm really curious about is if one day, it will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kitchen.Speaking of kitchens, here's some asparagus. They're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny.(Laughter)Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus, what you can see are all these tiny little vessels. And when we image them in the lab, you can see how the cellulose forms these structures. This image reminds me of two things: our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.So here's the question: Can we grow axons and neurons down these channels? Because if we can, then maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves. Or maybe even a spinal cord. Don't get me wrong \u2014 this is exceptionally challenging and really hard work to do, and we are not the only ones working on this. But we are the only ones using asparagus.(Laughter)Right now, we've got really promising pilot data. And we're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons to find out what's actually possible.So listen, all of the work I've shown you, the stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage and the other projects my lab is involved in are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage. Play \u2014 play is a key part of my scientific practice. It's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative and to decide to make human apple ears.So, the next time any of you are looking at some old, broken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology, I want you to think of me. Because I want it.(Laughter)Seriously, please find any way to get in touch with me, and let's see what we can build.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2502, "subtitle":

00:03:45.331\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:47.073\nIt's a good lab, man.\n\n00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:48.558\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:50.289\nAnd then we grew cells on them.\n\n00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:52.351\nAnd this is the result.\n\n00:03:53.874 --> 00:03:58.307\nListen, my lab is not\nin the ear-manufacturing business.\n\n00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:03.072\nPeople have actually been working\non this for decades.\n\n00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:04.744\nHere's the issue:\n\n00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:09.174\ncommercial scaffolds can be\nreally expensive and problematic,\n\n00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:11.799\nbecause they're sourced\nfrom proprietary products,\n\n00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:13.926\nanimals or cadavers.\n\n00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.093\nWe used an apple and it cost pennies.\n\n00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:24.868\nWhat's also really cool here\n\n00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:27.037\nis it's not that hard\nto make these things.\n\n00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:29.993\nThe equipment you need\ncan be built from garbage,\n\n00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:34.200\nand the key processing step\nonly requires soap and water.\n\n00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:38.666\nSo what we did was put all\nthe instructions online as open source.\n\n00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:41.487\nAnd then we founded\na mission-driven company,\n\n00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:43.889\nand we're developing kits\nto make it easier\n\n00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:46.484\nfor anyone with a sink\nand a soldering iron\n\n00:04:46.508 --> 00:04:48.066\nto make these things at home.\n\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.163\nWhat I'm really curious\nabout is if one day,\n\n00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:57.438\nit will be possible to repair, rebuild\nand augment our own bodies\n\n00:04:57.462 --> 00:04:59.458\nwith stuff we make in the kitchen.\n\n00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.376\nSpeaking of kitchens,\n\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.336\nhere's some asparagus.\n\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.043\nThey're tasty, and they make\nyour pee smell funny.\n\n00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:09.320\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:11.967\nNow, I was in my kitchen,\nand I was noticing\n\n00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.577\nthat when you look down\nthe stalks of these asparagus,\n\n00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:17.592\nwhat you can see\nare all these tiny little vessels.\n\n00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.265\nAnd when we image them in the lab,\n\n00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.278\nyou can see how the cellulose\nforms these structures.\n\n00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.063\nThis image reminds me of two things:\n\n00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.541\nour blood vessels\n\n00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:31.313\nand the structure and organization\nof our nerves and spinal cord.\n\n00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:33.109\nSo here's the question:\n\n00:05:33.818 --> 00:05:37.998\nCan we grow axons and neurons\ndown these channels?\n\n00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:39.648\nBecause if we can,\n\n00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:43.939\nthen maybe we can use asparagus\nto form new connections\n\n00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:46.820\nbetween the ends of damaged\nand severed nerves.\n\n00:05:47.585 --> 00:05:49.388\nOr maybe even a spinal cord.\n\n00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:51.370\nDon't get me wrong --\n\n00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:53.398\nthis is exceptionally challenging\n\n00:05:53.422 --> 00:05:55.017\nand really hard work to do,\n\n00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:57.659\nand we are not the only ones\nworking on this.\n\n00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:01.014\nBut we are the only ones using asparagus.\n\n00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:03.545\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:04.018 --> 00:06:07.136\nRight now, we've got\nreally promising pilot data.\n\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.043\nAnd we're working with tissue engineers\n\n00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:10.233\nand neurosurgeons\n\n00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.153\nto find out what's actually possible.\n\n00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:15.305\nSo listen, all of the work I've shown you,\n\n00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:18.522\nthe stuff that I've built\nthat's all around me on this stage\n\n00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:21.216\nand the other projects\nmy lab is involved in\n\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.327\nare all a direct result\nof me playing with your garbage.\n\n00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:31.388\nPlay -- play is a key part\nof my scientific practice.\n\n00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:35.396\nIt's how I train my mind\nto be unconventional and to be creative\n\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.425\nand to decide to make human apple ears.\n\n00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:43.100\nSo, the next time any of you\nare looking at some old,\n\n00:06:43.124 --> 00:06:47.703\nbroken-down, malfunctioning,\npiece-of-crap technology,\n\n00:06:47.727 --> 00:06:49.324\nI want you to think of me.\n\n00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:51.315\nBecause I want it.\n\n00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:52.490\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:52.514 --> 00:06:56.521\nSeriously, please find any way\nto get in touch with me,\n\n00:06:56.545 --> 00:06:58.486\nand let's see what we can build.\n\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.661\nThank you.\n\n00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:04.228\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The birth of virtual reality as an art form", "duration": "1054", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_milk_the_birth_of_virtual_reality_as_an_art_form", "transcript": "When I was a kid, I experienced something so powerful, I spent the rest of my life searching for it, and in all the wrong places. What I experienced wasn't virtual reality. It was music. And this is where the story begins.That's me, listening to the Beatles' \"White Album.\" And the look on my face is the feeling that I've been searching for ever since. Music goes straight to the emotional vein, into your bloodstream and right into your heart. It deepens every experience. Fellas?(Music)This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert and Joshua Roman. Music \u2014(Applause)Yeah.Music makes everything have more emotional resonance. Let's see how it does for this talk. The right piece of music at the right time fuses with us on a cellular level. When I hear that one song from that one summer with that one girl, I'm instantly transported back there again. Hey, Stacey.Here's a part of the story, though, where I got a little greedy. I thought if I added more layers on top of the music, I could make the feelings even more powerful. So I got into directing music videos. This is what they looked like. That's my brother, Jeff. Sorry about this, Jeff.(Laughter)Here's me, just so we're even. Incredible moves. Should've been a dancer.(Laughter)These experiments grew, and in time, started to look more like this. In both, I'm searching for the same thing, though, to capture that lightning in a bottle. Except, I'm not. Adding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension, yes, but never quite equated the power that just raw music had for me on its own. This is not a great thing to realize when you've devoted your life and professional career to becoming a music video director. I kept asking myself, did I take the wrong path? So I started thinking: if I could involve you, the audience, more, I might be able to make you feel something more as well.So Aaron Koblin and I began auditioning new technologies that could put more of you inside of the work, like your childhood home in \"The Wilderness Downtown,\" your hand-drawn portraits, in \"The Johnny Cash Project,\" and your interactive dreams in \"3 Dreams of Black.\" We were pushing beyond the screen, trying to connect more deeply to people's hearts and imaginations. But it wasn't quite enough. It still didn't have the raw experiential power of pure music for me.So I started chasing a new technology that I only had read about in science fiction. And after years of searching, I found a prototype. It was a project from Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a in Mark Bolas's lab in USC. And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it. I could taste the lightning. It was called virtual reality. This was it five years ago when I ran into it. This is what it looks like now.I quickly started building things in this new medium, and through that process we realized something: that VR is going to play an incredibly important role in the history of mediums. In fact, it's going to be the last one. I mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our internalization of an author's expression of an experience, to our experiencing it firsthand. You look confused. I'll explain. Don't worry.(Laughter)If we go back to the origins of mediums, by all best guesses, it starts around a fire, with a good story. Our clan leader is telling us about how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day. We hear his words and translate them into our own internal truths. The same thing happens when we look at the cave painting version of the story, the book about the mammoth hunt, the play, the radio broadcast, the television show or the movie. All of these mediums require what we call \"suspension of disbelief,\" because there's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpreting the story into our reality. I'm using the word \"consciousness\" as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us.Virtual reality bridges that gap. Now, you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader. Or you are the clan leader. Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.(Laughter)So here's what special about VR. In all other mediums, your consciousness interprets the medium. In VR, your consciousness is the medium. So the potential for VR is enormous. But where are we now? What is the current state of the art? Well, we are here. We are the equivalent of year one of cinema. This is the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers film that allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them. Similar to this early stage of this medium, in VR, we also have to move past the spectacle and into the storytelling. It took this medium decades to figure out its preferred language of storytelling, in the form of a feature film. In VR today, we're more learning grammar than writing language.We've made 15 films in the last year at our VR company, Vrse, and we've learned a few things. We found that we have a unique, direct path into your senses, your emotions, even your body.So let me show you some things. For the purpose of this demo, we're going to take every direction that you could possibly look, and stretch it into this giant rectangle. OK, here we go.So, first: camera movement is tricky in VR. Done wrong, it can actually make you sick. We found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line, you can actually get away with it, though. The first day in film school, they told me you have to learn every single rule before you can break one. We have not learned every single rule. We've barely learned any at all, but we're already trying to break them to see what kind of creative things we can accomplish. In this shot here, where we're moving up off the ground, I added acceleration. I did that because I wanted to give you a physical sensation of moving up off the ground. In VR, I can give that to you.(Music)Not surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium as well. It guides us how to feel. In this project we made with the New York Times, Zach Richter and our friend, JR, we take you up in a helicopter, and even though you're flying 2,000 feet above Manhattan, you don't feel afraid. You feel triumphant for JR's character. The music guides you there.(Music)Contrary to popular belief, there is composition in virtual reality, but it's completely different than in film, where you have a rectangular frame. Composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you. In this film, \"Waves of Grace,\" which was a collaboration between Vrse, the United Nations, Gabo Arora, and Imraan Ismail, we also see the changing role of the close-up in virtual reality. A close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone. It brings that character inside of your personal space, a space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love. And you feel an emotional closeness to the character because of what you feel to be a physical closeness.Directing VR is not like directing for the rectangle. It's more of a choreography of the viewer's attention. One tool we can use to guide your attention is called \"spatialized sound.\" I can put a sound anywhere in front of you, to left or right, even behind you, and when you turn your head, the sound will rotate accordingly. So I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see. Next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder, it might be Bono.(Laughter)VR makes us feel like we are part of something. For most of human history, we lived in small family units. We started in caves, then moved to clans and tribes, then villages and towns, and now we're all global citizens. But I believe that we are still hardwired to care the most about the things that are local to us. And VR makes anywhere and anyone feel local. That's why it works as an empathy machine. Our film \"Clouds Over Sidra\" takes you to a Syrian refugee camp, and instead of watching a story about people over there, it's now a story about us here.But where do we go from here? The tricky thing is that with all previous mediums, the format is fixed at its birth. Film has been a sequence of rectangles, from Muybridge and his horses to now. The format has never changed. But VR as a format, as a medium, isn't complete yet. It's not using physical celluloid or paper or TV signals. It actually employs what we use to make sense of the world. We're using your senses as the paints on the canvas, but only two right now. Eventually, we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed, and we will have agency to live the story in any path we choose. And we call it virtual reality right now, but what happens when we move past simulated realities? What do we call it then? What if instead of verbally telling you about a dream, I could let you live inside that dream? What if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth, you could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole, or create galaxies from scratch, or communicate with each other not using words but using our raw thoughts? That's not a virtual reality anymore. And honestly I don't know what that's called. But I hope you see where we're going.But here I am, intellectualizing a medium I'm saying is experiential. So let's experience it. In your hands, you hopefully hold a piece of cardboard. Let's open the flap. Tap on the power button to unlock the phone. For the people watching at home, we're going to put up a card right now to show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself, and even get a Google cardboard of your own to try it with. We played in cardboard boxes as kids, and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning by sticking our head in one again. You're about to participate in the largest collective VR viewing in history. And in that classic old-timey style of yesteryear, we're all going to watch something at the exact same time, together. Let's hope it works. What's the countdown look like? I can't see.Audience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1(Birds singing)(Train engine)Audience: (Shreiks)(Video) JR: Let me tell you how I shot the cover of the New York Times Magazine, \"Walking New York.\" I just got strapped on outside the helicopter, and I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it. And when I was perfectly above \u2014 you know, with the wind, we had to redo it a few times \u2014 then I kept shooting.(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord, protect us from evil, for you are the Lord, the light. You who gave us life took it away. Let your will be done. Please bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones. Help us to live again.(Music)(Video) (Children's voices)Child's voice: There are more kids in Zaatari than adults right now. Sometimes I think we are the ones in charge.Chris Milk: How was it?(Applause)That was a cheap way of getting you to do a standing ovation. I just made you all stand. I knew you'd applaud at the end.(Applause)I believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience what you just experienced. That way we can collectively start to shape this, not as a tech platform but as a humanity platform. And to that end, in November of last year, the New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called \"The Displaced.\" It launched with one million Google Cardboards sent out to every Sunday subscriber with their newspaper. But a funny thing happened that Sunday morning. A lot of people got them that were not the intended recipients on the mailing label. And we started seeing this all over Instagram. Look familiar?Music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the unattainable for a very long time. Now, millions of kids just had the same formative experience in their childhood that I had in mine. Only I think this one surpasses it. Let's see where this leads them.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2527, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:15.251\nWhen I was a

00:02:41.095\nI kept asking myself,\ndid I take the wrong path?\n\n00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:46.162\nSo I started thinking: if I could\ninvolve you, the audience, more,\n\n00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:49.188\nI might be able to make you\nfeel something more as well.\n\n00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.044\nSo Aaron Koblin and I began\nauditioning new technologies\n\n00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:56.206\nthat could put more of you\ninside of the work,\n\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.864\nlike your childhood home\nin \"The Wilderness Downtown,\"\n\n00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:04.468\nyour hand-drawn portraits,\nin \"The Johnny Cash Project,\"\n\n00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.939\nand your interactive dreams\n\n00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.446\nin \"3 Dreams of Black.\"\n\n00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:13.384\nWe were pushing beyond the screen,\n\n00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:15.389\ntrying to connect more deeply\n\n00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:17.790\nto people's hearts and imaginations.\n\n00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:20.049\nBut it wasn't quite enough.\n\n00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:26.015\nIt still didn't have the raw\nexperiential power of pure music for me.\n\n00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.462\nSo I started chasing a new technology\n\n00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:32.185\nthat I only had read about\nin science fiction.\n\n00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:35.193\nAnd after years of searching,\nI found a prototype.\n\n00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.053\nIt was a project from Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a\nin Mark Bolas's lab in USC.\n\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.128\nAnd when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.\n\n00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:46.545\nI could taste the lightning.\n\n00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:48.942\nIt was called virtual reality.\n\n00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:52.261\nThis was it five years ago\nwhen I ran into it.\n\n00:03:53.488 --> 00:03:55.550\nThis is what it looks like now.\n\n00:03:56.804 --> 00:04:00.709\nI quickly started building things\nin this new medium,\n\n00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:02.950\nand through that process\nwe realized something:\n\n00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:07.039\nthat VR is going to play\nan incredibly important role\n\n00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:08.778\nin the history of mediums.\n\n00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.356\nIn fact, it's going to be the last one.\n\n00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:16.963\nI mean this because it's the first medium\nthat actually makes the jump\n\n00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:20.275\nfrom our internalization\nof an author's expression\n\n00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.969\nof an experience,\n\n00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:24.645\nto our experiencing it firsthand.\n\n00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.813\nYou look confused.\nI'll explain. Don't worry.\n\n00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:29.231\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:32.978\nIf we go back to the origins of mediums,\n\n00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.366\nby all best guesses,\n\n00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.356\nit starts around a fire,\nwith a good story.\n\n00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.409\nOur clan leader is telling us\n\n00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:43.062\nabout how he hunted the woolly mammoth\non the tundra that day.\n\n00:04:44.027 --> 00:04:45.366\nWe hear his words\n\n00:04:46.048 --> 00:04:49.321\nand translate them\ninto our own internal truths.\n\n00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:51.962\nThe same thing happens\n\n00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:54.628\nwhen we look at the cave painting\nversion of the story,\n\n00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.782\nthe book about the mammoth hunt,\n\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.664\nthe play,\n\n00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:01.253\nthe radio broadcast,\n\n00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:02.872\nthe television show\n\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.695\nor the movie.\n\n00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.222\nAll of these mediums require\nwhat we call \"suspension of disbelief,\"\n\n00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:13.304\nbecause there's a translation gap\nbetween the reality of the story\n\n00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:16.750\nand our consciousness\ninterpreting the story\n\n00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:18.042\ninto our reality.\n\n00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.115\nI'm using the word \"consciousness\"\nas a feeling of reality that we get\n\n00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.475\nfrom our senses experiencing\nthe world around us.\n\n00:05:28.538 --> 00:05:31.335\nVirtual reality bridges that gap.\n\n00:05:31.943 --> 00:05:36.156\nNow, you are on the tundra\nhunting with the clan leader.\n\n00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.534\nOr you are the clan leader.\n\n00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:41.260\nOr maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.\n\n00:05:41.284 --> 00:05:42.919\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:47.788\nSo here's what special about VR.\n\n00:05:48.684 --> 00:05:50.263\nIn all other mediums,\n\n00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:52.557\nyour consciousness interprets the medium.\n\n00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:57.172\nIn VR, your consciousness is the medium.\n\n00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.791\nSo the potential for VR is enormous.\n\n00:06:00.815 --> 00:06:02.489\nBut where are we now?\n\n00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:05.099\nWhat is the current state of the art?\n\n00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:07.426\nWell,\n\n00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:09.893\nwe are here.\n\n00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:13.830\nWe are the equivalent\nof year one of cinema.\n\n00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:15.480\nThis is the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers film\n\n00:06:15.504 --> 00:06:18.863\nthat allegedly sent a theater full\nof people running for their lives\n\n00:06:18.887 --> 00:06:21.180\nas they thought a train\nwas coming toward them.\n\n00:06:22.094 --> 00:06:25.370\nSimilar to this early stage\nof this medium,\n\n00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:28.935\nin VR, we also have to move\npast the spectacle\n\n00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:30.845\nand into the storytelling.\n\n00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.616\nIt took this medium decades\n\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.298\nto figure out its preferred\nlanguage of storytelling,\n\n00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:37.098\nin the form of a feature film.\n\n00:06:37.122 --> 00:06:40.476\nIn VR today, we're more learning grammar\n\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.791\nthan writing language.\n\n00:06:42.838 --> 00:06:46.389\nWe've made 15 films in the last year\nat our VR company, Vrse,\n\n00:06:46.413 --> 00:06:48.030\nand we've learned a few things.\n\n00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.074\nWe found that we have a unique,\ndirect path into your senses,\n\n00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:54.907\nyour emotions, even your body.\n\n00:06:55.855 --> 00:06:57.530\nSo let me show you some things.\n\n00:06:57.554 --> 00:06:58.952\nFor the purpose of this demo,\n\n00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:02.041\nwe're going to take every direction\nthat you could possibly look,\n\n00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:04.278\nand stretch it into this giant rectangle.\n\n00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:06.991\nOK, here we go.\n\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.881\nSo, first: camera movement\nis tricky in VR.\n\n00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:16.007\nDone wrong, it can actually make you sick.\n\n00:07:16.888 --> 00:07:21.387\nWe found if you move the camera\nat a constant speed in a straight line,\n\n00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:23.628\nyou can actually get away with it, though.\n\n00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.379\nThe first day in film school,\n\n00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.990\nthey told me you have to learn\nevery single rule\n\n00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:29.772\nbefore you can break one.\n\n00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:31.970\nWe have not learned every single rule.\n\n00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:33.522\nWe've barely learned any at all,\n\n00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:35.363\nbut we're already trying to break them\n\n00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:37.916\nto see what kind of creative things\nwe can accomplish.\n\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.652\nIn this shot here, where we're moving up\noff the ground, I added acceleration.\n\n00:07:41.676 --> 00:07:44.509\nI did that because I wanted\nto give you a physical sensation\n\n00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:45.916\nof moving up off the ground.\n\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.433\nIn VR, I can give that to you.\n\n00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:53.829\n(Music)\n\n00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.387\nNot surprisingly, music matters a lot\nin this medium as well.\n\n00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.674\nIt guides us how to feel.\n\n00:08:02.312 --> 00:08:05.633\nIn this project we made\nwith the New York Times, Zach Richter\n\n00:08:05.657 --> 00:08:07.412\nand our friend, JR,\n\n00:08:07.436 --> 00:08:09.321\nwe take you up in a helicopter,\n\n00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:13.283\nand even though you're flying\n2,000 feet above Manhattan,\n\n00:08:13.307 --> 00:08:14.895\nyou don't feel afraid.\n\n00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:17.827\nYou feel triumphant for JR's character.\n\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.459\nThe music guides you there.\n\n00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:22.483\n(Music)\n\n00:08:29.322 --> 00:08:30.929\nContrary to popular belief,\n\n00:08:30.953 --> 00:08:33.619\nthere is composition in virtual reality,\n\n00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:35.704\nbut it's completely\ndifferent than in film,\n\n00:08:35.728 --> 00:08:37.453\nwhere you have a rectangular frame.\n\n00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:39.989\nComposition is now\nwhere your consciousness exists\n\n00:08:40.013 --> 00:08:41.960\nand how the world moves around you.\n\n00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:46.249\nIn this film, \"Waves of Grace,\"\nwhich was a collaboration between Vrse,\n\n00:08:46.273 --> 00:08:49.182\nthe United Nations, Gabo Arora,\nand Imraan Ismail,\n\n00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:52.448\nwe also see the changing role\nof the close-up in virtual reality.\n\n00:08:53.097 --> 00:08:57.310\nA close-up in VR means\nyou're actually close up to someone.\n\n00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.555\nIt brings that character inside\nof your personal space,\n\n00:09:00.579 --> 00:09:04.424\na space that we'd usually reserve\nfor the people that we love.\n\n00:09:04.448 --> 00:09:07.618\nAnd you feel an emotional\ncloseness to the character\n\n00:09:07.642 --> 00:09:10.350\nbecause of what you feel\nto be a physical closeness.\n\n00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:20.936\nDirecting VR is not like\ndirecting for the rectangle.\n\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.044\nIt's more of a choreography\nof the viewer's attention.\n\n00:09:24.822 --> 00:09:27.416\nOne tool we can use\nto guide your attention\n\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.873\nis called \"spatialized sound.\"\n\n00:09:28.897 --> 00:09:31.865\nI can put a sound anywhere\nin front of you, to left or right,\n\n00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:33.268\neven behind you,\n\n00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:36.288\nand when you turn your head,\nthe sound will rotate accordingly.\n\n00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:39.814\nSo I can use that to direct your attention\nto where I want you to see.\n\n00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:42.844\nNext time you hear someone\nsinging over your shoulder,\n\n00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:44.129\nit might be Bono.\n\n00:09:44.153 --> 00:09:45.360\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:50.497 --> 00:09:53.252\nVR makes us feel\nlike we are part of something.\n\n00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:57.926\nFor most of human history,\nwe lived in small family units.\n\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.461\nWe started in caves,\n\n00:09:59.485 --> 00:10:02.918\nthen moved to clans and tribes,\nthen villages and towns,\n\n00:10:02.942 --> 00:10:05.634\nand now we're all global citizens.\n\n00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:09.969\nBut I believe that we are still\nhardwired to care the most\n\n00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.490\nabout the things that are local to us.\n\n00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:18.241\nAnd VR makes anywhere\nand anyone feel local.\n\n00:10:18.265 --> 00:10:20.773\nThat's why it works as an empathy machine.\n\n00:10:20.797 --> 00:10:24.021\nOur film \"Clouds Over Sidra\"\ntakes you to a Syrian refugee camp,\n\n00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:28.596\nand instead of watching a story\nabout people over there,\n\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.443\nit's now a story about us here.\n\n00:10:34.344 --> 00:10:35.854\nBut where do we go from here?\n\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.847\nThe tricky thing is that\nwith all previous mediums,\n\n00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:41.241\nthe format is fixed at its birth.\n\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.029\nFilm has been a sequence of rectangles,\n\n00:10:44.053 --> 00:10:46.892\nfrom Muybridge and his horses to now.\n\n00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:48.885\nThe format has never changed.\n\n00:10:49.612 --> 00:10:53.059\nBut VR as a format, as a medium,\n\n00:10:54.328 --> 00:10:55.577\nisn't complete yet.\n\n00:10:56.725 --> 00:10:59.924\nIt's not using physical celluloid\nor paper or TV signals.\n\n00:10:59.948 --> 00:11:03.767\nIt actually employs what we use\nto make sense of the world.\n\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.503\nWe're using your senses\nas the paints on the canvas,\n\n00:11:08.527 --> 00:11:09.849\nbut only two right now.\n\n00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:15.451\nEventually, we can see if we will have\nall of our human senses employed,\n\n00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:19.670\nand we will have agency to live\nthe story in any path we choose.\n\n00:11:20.533 --> 00:11:22.989\nAnd we call it virtual reality right now,\n\n00:11:23.013 --> 00:11:25.807\nbut what happens when we move\npast simulated realities?\n\n00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:28.733\nWhat do we call it then?\n\n00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:32.297\nWhat if instead of verbally\ntelling you about a dream,\n\n00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:35.095\nI could let you live inside that dream?\n\n00:11:35.818 --> 00:11:39.445\nWhat if instead of just experiencing\nvisiting some reality on Earth,\n\n00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:43.895\nyou could surf gravitational waves\non the edge of a black hole,\n\n00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:46.695\nor create galaxies from scratch,\n\n00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:49.803\nor communicate with each other\nnot using words\n\n00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:51.730\nbut using our raw thoughts?\n\n00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.293\nThat's not a virtual reality anymore.\n\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.356\nAnd honestly I don't know\nwhat that's called.\n\n00:11:58.842 --> 00:12:01.174\nBut I hope you see where we're going.\n\n00:12:02.587 --> 00:12:06.309\nBut here I am, intellectualizing\na medium I'm saying is experiential.\n\n00:12:06.797 --> 00:12:08.223\nSo let's experience it.\n\n00:12:08.803 --> 00:12:11.998\nIn your hands, you hopefully hold\na piece of cardboard.\n\n00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:14.734\nLet's open the flap.\n\n00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:17.291\nTap on the power

I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time. Probably too much \u2014 I probably obsess over it. My friends think I do. But I feel like I kind of have to, because these days, it feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me, and when that happens, it feels like parts of my life are slipping away.Specifically, it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this, like technology \u2014 I check things. I'll give you an example. If this email shows up \u2014 how many of you have gotten an email like this, right? I've been tagged in a photo. When this appears, I can't help but click on it right now. Right? Because, like, what if it's a bad photo? So I have to click it right now. But I'm not just going to click \"See photo,\" what I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes.(Laughter)But the worst part is that I know this is what's going to happen, and even knowing that's what's going to happen doesn't stop me from doing it again the next time. Or I find myself in a situation like this, where I check my email and I pull down to refresh, But the thing is that 60 seconds later, I'll pull down to refresh again. Why am I doing this? This doesn't make any sense.But I'll give you a hint why this is happening. What do you think makes more money in the United States than movies, game parks and baseball combined? Slot machines. How can slot machines make all this money when we play with such small amounts of money? We play with coins. How is this possible? Well, the thing is ... my phone is a slot machine. Every time I check my phone, I'm playing the slot machine to see, what am I going to get? What am I going to get? Every time I check my email, I'm playing the slot machine, saying, \"What am I going to get?\" Every time I scroll a news feed, I'm playing the slot machine to see, what am I going to get next? And the thing is that, again, knowing exactly how this works \u2014 and I'm a designer, I know exactly how the psychology of this works, I know exactly what's going on \u2014 but it doesn't leave me with any choice, I still just get sucked into it.So what are we going to do? Because it leaves us with this all-or-nothing relationship with technology, right? You're either on, and you're connected and distracted all the time, or you're off, but then you're wondering, am I missing something important? In other words, you're either distracted or you have fear of missing out. Right?So we need to restore choice. We want to have a relationship with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it, and we're going to need help from designers, because knowing this stuff doesn't help. We're going to need design help. So what would that look like?So let's take an example that we all face: chat \u2014 text messaging. So let's say there's two people. Nancy's on the left and she's working on a document, and John's on the right. And John suddenly remembers, \"I need to ask Nancy for that document before I forget.\" So when he sends her that message, it blows away her attention.That's what we're doing all the time, bulldozing each other's attention, left and right. And there's serious cost to this, because every time we interrupt each other, it takes us about 23 minutes, on average, to refocus our attention. We actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing. This is Gloria Mark's research combined with Microsoft research, that showed this. And her research also shows that it actually trains bad habits. The more interruptions we get externally, it's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves. We actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes.This is crazy. So how do we fix this? Because Nancy and John are in this all-or-nothing relationship. Nancy might want to disconnect, but then she'd be worried: What if I'm missing something important?Design can fix this problem. Let's say you have Nancy again on the left, John on the right. And John remembers, \"I need to send Nancy that document.\" Except this time, Nancy can mark that she's focused. Let's say she drags a slider and says, \"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,\" so \u2014 bam \u2014 she's focused. Now when John wants to message her, he can get the thought off of his mind \u2014 because he has a need, he has this thought, and he needs to dump it out before he forgets. Except this time, it holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus, but John can get the thought off of his mind.But this only works if one last thing is true, which is that Nancy needs to know that if something is truly important, John can still interrupt. But instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions, we're now only creating conscious interruptions,So we're doing two things here. We're creating a new choice for both Nancy and John, But there's a second, subtle thing we're doing here, too. And it's that we're changing the question we're answering. Instead of the goal of chat being: \"Let's design it so it's easy to send a message\" \u2014 that's the goal of chat, it should be really easy to send a message to someone \u2014 we change the goal to something deeper and a human value, which is: \"Let's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship between two people. So we upgraded the goal.Now, do designers actually care about this? Do we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are? Well, I'll tell you one story. A little over a year ago, I got to help organize a meeting between some of technology's leading designers and Thich Nhat Hanh. Thich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation. And it was the most amazing meeting. You have to imagine \u2014 picture a room \u2014 on one side of the room, you have a bunch of tech geeks; on the other side of the room, you have a bunch of long brown robes, shaved heads, Buddhist monks. And the questions were about the deepest human values, like what does the future of technology look like when you're designing for the deepest questions and the deepest human values? And our conversation centered on listening more deeply to what those values might be. He joked in our conversation that what if, instead of a spell check, you had a compassion check, meaning, you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive \u2014 perceived as abrasive by someone else.So does this kind of conversation happen in the real world, not just in these design meetings? Well, the answer is yes, and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing. If you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay with a free couch, from someone who's trying to offer it.So, great service \u2014 what would their design goal be? What are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing? Well, you would think it's to match guests with hosts. Right? That's a pretty good goal. But that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before, where we're just trying to deliver a message.So what's the deeper, human goal? Well, they set their goal as the need to create lasting, positive experiences and relationships between people who've never met before. And the most amazing thing about this was in 2007, they introduced a way to measure this, which is incredible. I'll tell you how it works. For every design goal you have, you have to have a corresponding measurement to know how you're doing \u2014 a way of measuring success. So what they do is, let's say you take two people who meet up, and they take the number of days those two people spent together, and then they estimate how many hours were in those days \u2014 how many hours did those two people spend together? And then after they spend that time together, they ask both of them: How positive was your experience? Did you have a good experience with this person that you met? And they subtract from those positive hours the amount of time people spent on the website, because that's a cost to people's lives. Why should we value that as success? And what you were left with is something they refer to as \"net orchestrated conviviality,\" or, really, just a net \"Good Times\" created. The net hours that would have never existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.Can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day and measure your success in the actual net new contribution of hours in people's lives that are positive, that would have never existed if you didn't do what you were about to do at work today? Can you imagine a whole world that worked this way?Can you imagine a social network that \u2014 let's say you care about cooking, and it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized and the cooking articles that you were glad you read, and subtracted from that the articles you weren't glad you read or the time you spent scrolling that you didn't like? Imagine a professional social network that, instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created or messages sent, instead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get. And subtracted the amount of time people spent on the website. Or imagine dating services, like maybe Tinder or something, where instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did, which is how they measure success today, instead measured the deep, romantic, fulfilling connections people created. Whatever that was for them, by the way.But can you imagine a whole world that worked this way, that was helping you spend your time well? Now to do this you also need a new system, because you're probably thinking, today's Internet economy \u2014 today's economy in general \u2014 is measured in time spent. The more users you have, the more usage you have, the more time people spend, that's how we measure success.But we've solved this problem before. We solved it with organic, when we said we need to value things a different way. We said this is a different kind of food. So we can't compare it just based on price; this is a different category of food. We solved it with Leed Certification, where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustainability.What if we had something like that for technology? What if we had something whose entire purpose and goal was to help create net new positive contributions to human life? And what if we could value it a different way, so it would actually work? Imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores. Imagine you had web browsers that helped route you to these kinds of design products. Can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world?We can create this world today. Company leaders, all you have to do \u2014 only you can prioritize a new metric, which is your metric for net positive contribution to human life. And have an honest conversation about that. Maybe you're not doing so well to start with, but let's start that conversation.Designers, you can redefine success; you can redefine design. Arguably, you have more power than many people in your organization to create the choices that all of us live by. Maybe like in medicine, where we have a Hippocratic oath to recognize the responsibility and this higher value that we have to treat patients. What if designers had something like that, in terms of this new kind of design?And users, for all of us \u2014 we can demand technology that works this way. Now it may seem hard, but McDonald's didn't have salads until the consumer demand was there. Walmart didn't have organic food until the consumer demand was there. We have to demand this new kind of technology. And we can do that. And doing that would amount to shifting from a world that's driven and run entirely on time spent, to world that's driven by time well spent.I want to live in this world, and I want this conversation to happen. Let's start that conversation now.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2525, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:17.511\nWhat does it mean to spend our time well?\n\n00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:21.940\nI spend a lot of my time\n\n00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.574\nthinking about how to spend my time.\n\n00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:29.159\nProbably too much --\nI probably obsess over it.\n\n00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:30.628\nMy friends think I do.\n\n00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:35.139\nBut I feel like I kind of have to,\nbecause these days,\n\n00:00:35.163 --> 00:00:39.044\nit feels like little bits of my time\nkind of slip away from me,\n\n00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:43.586\nand when that happens, it feels like\nparts of my life are slipping away.\n\n00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.195\nSpecifically,\n\n00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.068\nit feels like little bits\nof my time get slipped away\n\n00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:50.696\nto various things like this,\n\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.687\nlike technology -- I check things.\n\n00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:54.762\nI'll give you an example.\n\n00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:57.535\nIf this email shows up --\n\n00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.244\nhow many of you have gotten\nan email like this, right?\n\n00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.566\nI've been tagged in a photo.\n\n00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:05.445\nWhen this appears,\n\n00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:08.880\nI can't help but click on it right now.\n\n00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:11.445\nRight?

get next?\n\n00:02:58.304 --> 00:02:59.455\nAnd the thing is that,\n\n00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.571\nagain, knowing exactly\nhow this works -- and I'm a designer,\n\n00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:04.872\nI know exactly how\nthe psychology of this works,\n\n00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:06.751\nI know exactly what's going on --\n\n00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:09.017\nbut it doesn't leave me with any choice,\n\n00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.092\nI still just get sucked into it.\n\n00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:13.941\nSo what are we going to do?\n\n00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.970\nBecause it leaves us\nwith this all-or-nothing relationship\n\n00:03:17.994 --> 00:03:19.474\nwith technology, right?\n\n00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:21.974\nYou're either on,\n\n00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.843\nand you're connected\nand distracted all the time,\n\n00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:26.717\nor you're off,\n\n00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:27.995\nbut then you're wondering,\n\n00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.644\nam I missing something important?\n\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.564\nIn other words, you're either distracted\n\n00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:35.462\nor you have fear of missing out.\n\n00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:37.478\nRight?\n\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.882\nSo we need to restore choice.\n\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.420\nWe want to have\na relationship with technology\n\n00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:50.650\nthat gives us back choice\nabout how we spend time with it,\n\n00:03:50.674 --> 00:03:53.731\nand we're going to need\nhelp from designers,\n\n00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.425\nbecause knowing this stuff doesn't help.\n\n00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.501\nWe're going to need design help.\n\n00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:01.452\nSo what would that look like?\n\n00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:05.421\nSo let's take an example that we all face:\n\n00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.491\nchat -- text messaging.\n\n00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.624\nSo let's say there's two people.\n\n00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:12.804\nNancy's on the left\nand she's working on a document,\n\n00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:14.035\nand John's on the right.\n\n00:04:14.627 --> 00:04:16.264\nAnd John suddenly remembers,\n\n00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:19.891\n\"I need to ask Nancy\nfor that document before I forget.\"\n\n00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:23.916\nSo when he sends her that message,\n\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.026\nit blows away her attention.\n\n00:04:27.394 --> 00:04:30.802\nThat's what we're doing all the time,\nbulldozing each other's attention,\n\n00:04:30.826 --> 00:04:32.240\nleft and right.\n\n00:04:32.264 --> 00:04:34.030\nAnd there's serious cost to this,\n\n00:04:34.492 --> 00:04:37.123\nbecause every time\nwe interrupt each other,\n\n00:04:38.687 --> 00:04:41.934\nit takes us about 23 minutes, on average,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.798\nto refocus our attention.\n\n00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:47.170\nWe actually cycle through\ntwo different projects\n\n00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:49.903\nbefore we come back\nto the original thing we were doing.\n\n00:04:50.764 --> 00:04:55.105\nThis is Gloria Mark's research\ncombined with Microsoft research,\n\n00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.487\nthat showed this.\n\n00:04:56.511 --> 00:05:00.466\nAnd her research also shows\nthat it actually trains bad habits.\n\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.935\nThe more interruptions we get externally,\n\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.720\nit's conditioning and training us\nto interrupt ourselves.\n\n00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.841\nWe actually self-interrupt\nevery three-and-a-half minutes.\n\n00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:14.285\nThis is crazy.\n\n00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:15.610\nSo how do we fix this?\n\n00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:18.884\nBecause Nancy and John are in this\nall-or-nothing relationship.\n\n00:05:18.908 --> 00:05:20.409\nNancy might want to disconnect,\n\n00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:21.786\nbut then she'd be worried:\n\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.861\nWhat if I'm missing something important?\n\n00:05:24.254 --> 00:05:26.217\nDesign can fix this problem.\n\n00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:29.302\nLet's say you have\nNancy again on the left,\n\n00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:30.498\nJohn on the right.\n\n00:05:30.522 --> 00:05:33.213\nAnd John remembers,\n\"I need to send Nancy that document.\"\n\n00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:34.466\nExcept this time,\n\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.427\nNancy can mark that she's focused.\n\n00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.419\nLet's say she drags a slider and says,\n\n00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:40.366\n\"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,\"\n\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.825\nso -- bam -- she's focused.\n\n00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.349\nNow when John wants to message her,\n\n00:05:45.373 --> 00:05:47.500\nhe can get the thought off of his mind --\n\n00:05:47.524 --> 00:05:49.597\nbecause he has a need,\nhe has this thought,\n\n00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:52.048\nand he needs to dump it out\nbefore he forgets.\n\n00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:54.224\nExcept this time,\n\n00:05:54.248 --> 00:05:58.552\nit holds the messages\nso that Nancy can still focus,\n\n00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:01.119\nbut John can get the thought\noff of his mind.\n\n00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:06.032\nBut this only works\nif one last thing is true,\n\n00:06:06.056 --> 00:06:10.542\nwhich is that Nancy needs to know\nthat if something is truly important,\n\n00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:13.200\nJohn can still interrupt.\n\n00:06:16.116 --> 00:06:20.229\nBut instead of having constant\naccidental or mindless interruptions,\n\n00:06:20.253 --> 00:06:22.935\nwe're now only creating\nconscious interruptions,\n\n00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:26.464\nSo we're doing two things here.\n\n00:06:26.488 --> 00:06:29.590\nWe're creating a new choice\nfor both Nancy and John,\n\n00:06:30.394 --> 00:06:33.200\nBut there's a second, subtle thing\nwe're doing here, too.\n\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.109\nAnd it's that we're changing\nthe question we're answering.\n\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.868\nInstead of the goal of chat being:\n\n00:06:42.014 --> 00:06:45.211\n\"Let's design it so it's easy\nto send a message\" --\n\n00:06:45.235 --> 00:06:46.665\nthat's the goal of chat,\n\n00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.384\nit should be really easy to send\na message to someone --\n\n00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:52.846\nwe change the goal to something\ndeeper and a human value,\n\n00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.074\nwhich is: \"Let's create the highest\npossible quality communication\n\n00:06:57.098 --> 00:06:59.581\nin a relationship between two people.\n\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.985\nSo we upgraded the goal.\n\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.601\nNow, do designers\nactually care about this?\n\n00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:11.654\nDo we want to have conversations\nabout what these deeper human goals are?\n\n00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:14.255\nWell, I'll tell you one story.\n\n00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:17.349\nA little over a year ago,\n\n00:07:17.373 --> 00:07:20.453\nI got to help organize a meeting\n\n00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:25.349\nbetween some of technology's leading\ndesigners and Thich Nhat Hanh.\n\n00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:31.092\nThich Nhat Hanh is an international\nspokesperson for mindfulness meditation.\n\n00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:32.867\nAnd it was the most amazing meeting.\n\n00:07:32.891 --> 00:07:34.911\nYou have to imagine -- picture a room --\n\n00:07:34.935 --> 00:07:38.788\non one side of the room,\nyou have a bunch of tech geeks;\n\n00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:40.308\non the other side of the room,\n\n00:07:40.332 --> 00:07:45.313\nyou have a bunch of long brown robes,\nshaved heads, Buddhist monks.\n\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.631\nAnd the questions were about\nthe deepest human values,\n\n00:07:49.655 --> 00:07:51.973\nlike what does the future\nof technology look like\n\n00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:54.212\nwhen you're designing\nfor the deepest questions\n\n00:07:54.236 --> 00:07:55.719\nand the deepest human values?\n\n00:07:56.403 --> 00:08:00.093\nAnd our conversation centered\non listening more deeply\n\n00:08:00.117 --> 00:08:02.045\nto what those values might be.\n\n00:08:02.887 --> 00:08:04.594\nHe joked in our conversation\n\n00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:06.566\nthat what if, instead of a spell check,\n\n00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:09.540\nyou had a compassion check,\n\n00:08:09.564 --> 00:08:13.927\nmeaning, you might highlight a word\nthat might be accidentally abrasive --\n\n00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:15.865\nperceived as abrasive by someone else.\n\n00:08:16.802 --> 00:08:20.773\nSo does this kind of conversation\nhappen in the real world,\n\n00:08:20.797 --> 00:08:22.919\nnot just in these design meetings?\n\n00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:25.050\nWell, the answer is yes,\n\n00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:27.371\nand one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.\n\n00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:30.824\nIf you didn't know,\nCouchsurfing is a website\n\n00:08:30.848 --> 00:08:34.733\nthat matches people\nwho are looking for a place to stay\n\n00:08:34.757 --> 00:08:37.628\nwith a free couch, from someone\nwho's trying to offer it.\n\n00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.686\nSo, great service --\n\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.374\nwhat would their design goal be?\n\n00:08:41.398 --> 00:08:44.145\nWhat are you designing\nfor if you work at Couchsurfing?\n\n00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.693\nWell, you would think\nit's to match guests with hosts.\n\n00:08:49.547 --> 00:08:50.697\nRight?\n\n00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:51.976\nThat's a pretty good goal.\n\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.919\nBut that would kind of be like\nour goal with messaging before,\n\n00:08:54.943 --> 00:08:57.308\nwhere we're just trying\nto deliver a message.\n\n00:08:57.332 --> 00:08:59.474\nSo what's the deeper, human goal?\n\n00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:02.078\nWell, they set their goal\n\n00:09:02.102 --> 00:09:07.756\nas the need to create lasting,\npositive experiences and relationships\n\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.939\nbetween people who've never met before.\n\n00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.884\nAnd the most amazing thing\nabout this was in 2007,\n\n00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:16.549\nthey introduced a way to measure this,\n\n00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:18.024\nwhich is incredible.\n\n00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:19.355\nI'll tell you how it works.\n\n00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:20.926\nFor every design goal you have,\n\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.018\nyou have to have\na corresponding measurement\n\n00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:24.591\nto know how you're doing --\n\n00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:25.950\na way of measuring success.\n\n00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:27.270\nSo what they do is,\n\n00:09:27.294 --> 00:09:29.737\nlet's say you take two people who meet up,\n\n00:09:32.078 --> 00:09:35.723\nand they take the number of days\nthose two people spent together,\n\n00:09:36.968 --> 00:09:40.438\nand then they estimate how many\nhours were in those days --\n\n00:09:41.094 --> 00:09:43.911\nhow many hours did\nthose two people spend together?\n\n00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:46.070\nAnd then after they spend\nthat time together,\n\n00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:47.284\nthey ask both of them:\n\n00:09:47.308 --> 00:09:49.266\nHow positive was your experience?\n\n00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.339\nDid you have a good experience\nwith this person that you met?\n\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.280\nAnd they subtract\nfrom those positive hours\n\n00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.621\nthe amount of time\npeople spent on the website,\n\n00:10:00.383 --> 00:10:03.097\nbecause that's a cost to people's lives.\n\n00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:05.384\nWhy should we value that as success?\n\n00:10:06.024 --> 00:10:07.480\nAnd what you were left with\n\n00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:12.245\nis something they refer to as \"net\norchestrated conviviality,\"\n\n00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:14.951\nor, really, just a net\n\"Good Times\" created.\n\n00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:20.007\nThe net hours that would have never\nexisted, had Couchsurfing not existed.\n\n00:10:20.757 --> 00:10:24.717\nCan you imagine how inspiring it would be\nto come to work every day\n\n00:10:24.741 --> 00:10:26.234\nand measure your success\n\n00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:31.287\nin the actual net new contribution\nof hours in people's lives\n\n00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:33.912\nthat are positive,\nthat would have never existed\n\n00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:36.746\nif you didn't do what you were\nabout to do at work today?\n\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.630\nCan you imagine a whole world\nthat worked this way?\n\n00:10:43.522 --> 00:10:46.277\nCan you imagine a social network that --\n\n00:10:46.301 --> 00:10:47.884\nlet's say you care about cooking,\n\n00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:50.939\nand it measured its success\nin terms of cooking nights organized\n\n00:10:50.963 --> 00:10:53.928\nand the cooking articles\nthat you were glad you read,\n\n00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:56.929\nand subtracted from that the articles\nyou weren't glad you read\n\n00:10:56.953 --> 00:10:59.516\nor the time you spent scrolling\nthat you didn't like?\n\n00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:03.463\nImagine a professional social network\n\n00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:07.402\nthat, instead of measuring its success\nin terms of connections created\n\n00:11:07.426 --> 00:11:09.015\nor messages sent,\n\n00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:13.351\ninstead measured its success in terms\nof the job offers that people got\n\n00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:15.204\nthat they were excited to get.\n\n00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:19.877\nAnd subtracted the amount of time\npeople spent on the website.\n\n00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:23.636\nOr imagine dating services,\n\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.398\nlike maybe Tinder or something,\n\n00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:28.900\nwhere instead of measuring the number\nof swipes left and right people did,\n\n00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:31.008\nwhich is how they measure success today,\n\n00:11:31.032 --> 00:11:37.177\ninstead measured the deep, romantic,\nfulfilling connections people created.\n\n00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:40.630\nWhatever that was for them, by the way.\n\n00:11:43.844 --> 00:11:47.072\nBut can you imagine a whole world\nthat worked this way,\n\n00:11:47.096 --> 00:11:49.348\nthat was helping you spend your time well?\n\n00:11:50.967 --> 00:11:52.996\nNow to do this you also need a new system,\n\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.698\nbecause you're probably thinking,\n\n00:11:54.722 --> 00:11:56.277\ntoday's Internet economy --\n\n00:11:56.301 --> 00:11:57.734\ntoday's economy in general --\n\n00:11:57.758 --> 00:11:59.028\nis measured in time spent.\n\n00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.099\nThe more users you have,\n\n00:12:01.123 --> 00:12:02.501\nthe more usage you have,\n\n00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:03.843\nthe more time people spend,\n\n00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:05.525\nthat's how we measure success.\n\n00:12:06.377 --> 00:12:08.309\nBut we've solved this problem before.\n\n00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:11.859\nWe solved it with organic,\n\n00:12:11.883 --> 00:12:14.817\nwhen we said we need\nto value things a different way.\n\n00:12:14.841 --> 00:12:17.777\nWe said this is a different kind of food.\n\n00:12:19.025 --> 00:12:21.074\nSo we can't compare it\njust based on price;\n\n00:12:21.098 --> 00:12:22.938\nthis is a different category of food.\n\n00:12:22.962 --> 00:12:25.695\nWe solved it with Leed Certification,\n\n00:12:25.719 --> 00:12:29.166\nwhere we said this\nis a different kind of building\n\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.337\nthat stood for different values\nof environmental sustainability.\n\n00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:38.506\nWhat if we had something\nlike that for technology?\n\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.927\nWhat if we had something\nwhose entire purpose and goal\n\n00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:49.224\nwas to help create net new positive\ncontributions to human life?\n\n00:12:50.929 --> 00:12:54.284\nAnd what if we could\nvalue it a different way,\n\n00:12:54.308 --> 00:12:55.806\nso it would actually work?\n\n00:12:56.592 --> 00:13:00.523\nImagine you gave this different\npremium shelf space on app stores.\n\n00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:02.882\nImagine you had web browsers\nthat helped route you\n\n00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:05.380\nto these kinds of design products.\n\n00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:11.931\nCan you imagine how exciting it would be\nto live and create that world?\n\n00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:15.890\nWe can create this world today.\n\n00:13:16.936 --> 00:13:19.708\nCompany leaders, all you have to do --\n\n00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.620\nonly you can prioritize a new metric,\n\n00:13:23.104 --> 00:13:27.507\nwhich is your metric for net positive\ncontribution to human life.\n\n00:13:27.531 --> 00:13:29.582\nAnd have an honest\nconversation about that.\n\n00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:31.767\nMaybe you're not\ndoing so well to start with,\n\n00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:33.482\nbut let's start that conversation.\n\n00:13:34.993 --> 00:13:40.688\nDesigners, you can redefine success;\nyou can redefine design.\n\n00:13:40.712 --> 00:13:44.645\nArguably, you have more power\nthan many people in your organization\n\n00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:47.592\nto create the choices\nthat all of us live by.\n\n00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:49.670\nMaybe like in medicine,\n\n00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:51.552\nwhere we have a Hippocratic oath\n\n00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:55.698\nto recognize the responsibility\nand this higher value\n\n00:13:55.722 --> 00:13:57.289\nthat we have to treat patients.\n\n00:13:57.313 --> 00:13:59.353\nWhat if designers had something like that,\n\n00:13:59.377 --> 00:14:01.209\nin terms of this new kind of design?\n\n00:14:02.626 --> 00:14:04.631\nAnd users, for all of us --\n\n00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:08.158\nwe can demand technology\nthat works this way.\n\n00:14:09.134 --> 00:14:10.801\nNow it may seem hard,\n\n00:14:10.825 --> 00:14:15.222\nbut McDonald's didn't have salads\nuntil the consumer demand was there.\n\n00:14:16.487 --> 00:14:20.680\nWalmart didn't have organic food\nuntil the consumer demand was there.\n\n00:14:20.704 --> 00:14:25.449\nWe have to demand\nthis new kind of technology.\n\n00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:27.433\nAnd we can do that.\n\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.562\nAnd doing that\n\n00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:33.103\nwould amount to shifting\nfrom a world that's driven and run\n\n00:14:33.127 --> 00:14:35.697\nentirely on time spent,\n\n00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:41.144\nto world that's driven by time well spent.\n\n00:14:43.527 --> 00:14:45.614\nI want to live in this world,\n\n00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:47.726\nand I want this conversation to happen.\n\n00:14:48.544 --> 00:14:50.394\nLet's start that conversation now.\n\n00:14:51.665 --> 00:14:52.816\nThank you.\n\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.735\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "I survived a terrorist attack. Here's what I learned", "duration": "637", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/gill_hicks_i_survived_a_terrorist_attack_here_s_what_i_learned", "transcript": "I could never have imagined that a 19-year-old suicide bomber would actually teach me a valuable lesson. But he did. He taught me to never presume anything about anyone you don't know.On a Thursday morning in July 2005, the bomber and I, unknowingly, boarded the same train carriage at the same time, standing, apparently, just feet apart. I didn't see him. Actually, I didn't see anyone. You know not to look at anyone on the Tube, but I guess he saw me. I guess he looked at all of us, as his hand hovered over the detonation switch. I've often wondered: What was he thinking? Especially in those final seconds.I know it wasn't personal. He didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks. I mean \u2014 he didn't know me. No. Instead, he gave me an unwarranted and an unwanted label. I had become the enemy. To him, I was the \"other,\" the \"them,\" as opposed to \"us.\" The label \"enemy\" allowed him to dehumanize us. It allowed him to push that button. And he wasn't selective. Twenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone, and I was almost one of them.In the time it takes to draw a breath, we were plunged into a darkness so immense that it was almost tangible; what I imagine wading through tar might be like. We didn't know we were the enemy. We were just a bunch of commuters who, minutes earlier, had followed the Tube etiquette: no direct eye contact, no talking and absolutely no conversation.But in the lifting of the darkness, we were reaching out. We were helping each other. We were calling out our names, a little bit like a roll call, waiting for responses.\"I'm Gill. I'm here. I'm alive. OK.\"\"I'm Gill. Here. Alive. OK.\"I didn't know Alison. But I listened for her check-ins every few minutes. I didn't know Richard. But it mattered to me that he survived.All I shared with them was my first name. They didn't know that I was a head of a department at the Design Council. And here is my beloved briefcase, also rescued from that morning. They didn't know that I published architecture and design journals, that I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, that I wore black \u2014 still do \u2014 that I smoked cigarillos. I don't smoke cigarillos anymore. I drank gin and I watched TED Talks, of course, never dreaming that one day I would be standing, balancing on prosthetic legs, giving a talk.I was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London. And I wasn't ready for that all to end. I was so determined to survive that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs, and I just shut everything and everyone out, to focus, to listen to myself, to be guided by instinct alone. I lowered my breathing rate. I elevated my thighs. I held myself upright and I fought the urge to close my eyes.I held on for almost an hour, an hour to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point. Perhaps I should have done more. Perhaps I could have lived more, seen more. Maybe I should have gone running, dancing, taken up yoga. But my priority and my focus was always my work. I lived to work. Who I was on my business card mattered to me. But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.By the time I felt that first touch from one of my rescuers, I was unable to speak, unable to say even a small word, like \"Gill.\" I surrendered my body to them. I had done all I possibly could, and now I was in their hands.I understood just who and what humanity really is, when I first saw the ID tag that was given to me when I was admitted to hospital. And it read: \"One unknown estimated female.\" One unknown estimated female. Those four words were my gift. What they told me very clearly was that my life was saved, purely because I was a human being. Difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go to save my life, to save as many unknowns as they could, and putting their own lives at risk. To them, it didn't matter if I was rich or poor, the color of my skin, whether I was male or female, my sexual orientation, who I voted for, whether I was educated, if I had a faith or no faith at all. Nothing mattered other than I was a precious human life.I see myself as a living fact. I am proof that unconditional love and respect can not only save, but it can transform lives. Here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I taken just last year. Ten years after the event, and here we are, arm in arm.Throughout all the chaos, my hand was held tightly. My face was stroked gently. What did I feel? I felt loved. What's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution, what's given me the courage to say: this ends with me is love. I was loved.I believe the potential for widespread positive change is absolutely enormous because I know what we're capable of. I know the brilliance of humanity. So this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder and some questions for us all to consider: Is what unites us not far greater than what can ever divide? Does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species, as human beings? And when will we embrace the wisdom of our era to rise above mere tolerance and move to an acceptance for all who are only a label until we know them?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2535, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:15.465\nI could never have imagined\n\n00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:19.441\nthat a 19-year-old suicide bomber\n\n00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:23.146\nwould actually teach me a valuable lesson.\n\n00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:25.765\nBut he did.\n\n00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:31.217\nHe taught me to never presume anything\n\n00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:34.381\nabout anyone you don't know.\n\n00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:40.501\nOn a Thursday morning in July 2005,\n\n00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.583\nthe bomber and I, unknowingly,\n\n00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:48.154\nboarded the same train carriage\nat the same time,\n\n00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:52.641\nstanding, apparently, just feet apart.\n\n00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:55.453\nI didn't see him.\n\n00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.934\nActually, I didn't see anyone.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.545\nYou know not to look\nat anyone on the Tube,\n\n00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.870\nbut I guess he saw me.\n\n00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:07.915\nI guess he looked at all of us,\n\n00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:12.859\nas his hand hovered\nover the detonation switch.\n\n00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:18.842\nI've often wondered: What was he thinking?\n\n00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:22.223\nEspecially in those final seconds.\n\n00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:26.332\nI know it wasn't personal.\n\n00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:30.952\nHe didn't set out to kill\nor maim me, Gill Hicks.\n\n00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:32.729\nI mean -- he didn't know me.\n\n00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:34.890\nNo.\n\n00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:38.570\nInstead, he gave me\n\n00:01:38.594 --> 00:01:43.199\nan unwarranted and an unwanted label.\n\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.610\nI had become the enemy.\n\n00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:52.924\nTo him, I was the \"other,\"\n\n00:01:52.948 --> 00:01:55.645\nthe \"them,\" as opposed to \"us.\"\n\n00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.813\nThe label \"enemy\" allowed him\nto dehumanize us.\n\n00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:06.059\nIt allowed him to push that button.\n\n00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:09.464\nAnd he wasn't selective.\n\n00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:16.016\nTwenty-six precious lives were taken\nin my carriage alone,\n\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.928\nand I was almost one of them.\n\n00:02:20.813 --> 00:02:23.554\nIn the time it takes to draw a breath,\n\n00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:27.248\nwe were plunged into a darkness so immense\n\n00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.654\nthat it was almost tangible;\n\n00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:34.037\nwhat I imagine wading\nthrough tar might be like.\n\n00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:37.406\nWe didn't know we were the enemy.\n\n00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:42.337\nWe were just a bunch of commuters\nwho, minutes earlier,\n\n00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.845\nhad followed the Tube etiquette:\n\n00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.075\nno direct eye contact,\n\n00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.249\nno talking\n\n00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.724\nand absolutely no conversation.\n\n00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.859\nBut in the lifting of the darkness,\n\n00:02:57.734 --> 00:02:59.359\nwe were reaching out.\n\n00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:01.649\nWe were helping each other.\n\n00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.227\nWe were calling out our names,\n\n00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.402\na little bit like a roll call,\n\n00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:10.624\nwaiting for responses.\n\n00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:15.180\n\"I'm Gill.

"transcript": "As a little Hawaiian, my mom and auntie always told me stories about Kalaupapa \u2014 the Hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world \u2014 and Father Damien, the Belgian missionary who gave his life for the Hawaiian community. As a young nurse, my aunt trained the nuns caring for the remaining lepers almost a 100 years after Father Damien died of leprosy. I remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule, while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to Kalaupapa.You see, as a youngster, I was always curious about a few things. First was why a Belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation in Kalaupapa, knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy from the community of people he sought to help. And secondly, where did the leprosy bacteria come from? And why were K\u0101naka Maoli, the indigenous people of Hawaii, so susceptible to developing leprosy, or \"mai Pake?\"This got my curious about what makes us unique as Hawaiians \u2014 namely, our genetic makeup. But it wasn't until high school, through the Human Genome Project, that I realized I wasn't alone in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry to our potential health, wellness and illness. You see, the 2.7 billion-dollar project promised an era of predictive and preventative medicine based on our unique genetic makeup. So to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream, we would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people to obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet. That's why 10 years later, it continues to shock me, knowing that 96 percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused exclusively on individuals of European ancestry.Now you don't need a PhD to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity. And in my own searching, I've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities, like myself. So that begs the question: Who is the Human Genome Project actually for? Just like we have different colored eyes and hair, we metabolize drugs differently based on the variation in our genomes. So how many of you would be shocked to learn that 95 percent of clinical trials have also exclusively featured individuals of European ancestry?This bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust. For example, in 1989, researchers from Arizona State University obtained blood samples from Arizona's Havasupai tribe, promising to alleviate the burden of type 2 diabetes that was plaguing their community, only to turn around and use those exact same samples \u2014 without the Havasupai's consent \u2014 to study rates of schizophrenia, inbreeding, and challenge the Havasupai's origin story. When the Havasupai found out, they sued successfully for $700,000, and they banned ASU from conducting research on their reservation. This culminated in a sort of domino effect with local tribes in the Southwest \u2014 including the Navajo Nation, one of the largest tribes in the country \u2014 putting a moratorium on genetic research.Now despite this history of distrust, I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research. And if we don't do something soon, the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen. Hawaii, for example, has the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the US, yet native Hawaiians like myself die a full decade before our non-native counterparts, because we have some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and the number one and number two killers in the US: cardiovascular disease and cancer.So how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benefit? My vision is to make genetic research more native, to indigenize genome sequencing technology.Traditionally, genomes are sequenced in laboratories. Here's an image of your classic genome sequencer. It's huge. It's the size of a refrigerator. There's this obvious physical limitation. But what if you could sequence genomes on the fly? What if you could fit a genome sequencer in your pocket? This nanopore-based sequencer is one 10,000th the size of your traditional genome sequencer. It doesn't have the same physical limitations, in that it's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords, large vats of chemicals or computer monitors. It allows us to de-black box genome sequencing technology development in a way that's immersive and collaborative, activating and empowering indigenous communities ... as citizen scientists.100 years later in Kalaupapa, we now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time, using mobile genome sequencers, remote access to the Internet and cloud computation. But only if that's what Hawaiian people want. In our space, on our terms.IndiGenomics is about science for the people by the people. We'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource, focused on educating indigenous communities on the potential use and misuse of genetic information. Eventually we'd like to have our own IndiGenomics research institute to conduct our own experiments and educate the next generation of indigenous scientists.In the end, indigenous people need to be partners in and not subjects of genetic research. And for those on the outside, just as Father Damien did, the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying.Mahalo.(Applause)", "id": 2528, "subtitle":

For example, some of us tend to think that it's very difficult to transform failing government systems. When we think of government systems, we tend to think that they're archaic, set in their ways, and perhaps, the leadership is just too bureaucratic to be able to change things. Well, today, I want to challenge that theory. I want to tell you a story of a very large government system that has not only put itself on the path of reform but has also shown fairly spectacular results in less than three years.This is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like. There are 1 million such schools in India. And even for me, who's lived in India all her life, walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking. By the time kids are 11, 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover. 11-year-olds cannot do simple addition, they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence. These are things that you and I would expect an 8-year-old to be able to do. By the time kids are 13 or 14, they tend to drop out of schools. In India, public schools not only offer free education \u2014 they offer free textbooks, free workbooks, free meals, sometimes even cash scholarships. And yet, 40 percent of the parents today are choosing to pull their children out of public schools and pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools. As a comparison, in a far richer country, the US, that number is only 10 percent. That's a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is.So it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 2013 from an absolutely brilliant lady called Surina Rajan. She was, at that time, the head of the Department of School Education in a state called Haryana in India. So she said to us, \"Look, I've been heading this department for the last two years. I've tried a number of things, and nothing seems to work. Can you possibly help?\"Let me describe Haryana a little bit to you. Haryana is a state which has 30 million people. It has 15,000 public schools and 2 million plus children in those public schools. So basically, with that phone call, I promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself. As I started this project, I was very painfully aware of two things. One, that I had never done anything like this before. And two, many others had, perhaps without too much success. As my colleagues and I looked across the country and across the world, we couldn't find another example that we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana. We knew that we had to craft our own journey.But anyway, we jumped right in and as we jumped in, all sorts of ideas started flying at us. People said, \"Let's change the way we recruit teachers, let's hire new principals and train them and send them on international learning tours, let's put technology inside classrooms.\" By the end of week one, we had 50 ideas on the table, all amazing, all sounded right. There was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things.So I said, \"Hang on, stop. Let's first at least decide what is it we're trying to achieve.\" So with a lot of push and pull and debate, Haryana set itself a goal which said: by 2020, we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge. Now the specifics of the goal don't matter here, but what matters is how specific the goal is. Because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to implement. Does this idea support this goal? If yes, let's keep it. But if it doesn't or we're not sure, then let's put it aside. As simple as it sounds, having a very specific goal right up front has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused in our transformation journey. And looking back over the last two and a half years, that has been a huge positive for us.So we had the goal, and now we needed to figure out what are the issues, what is broken. Before we went into schools, a lot of people told us that education quality is poor because either the teachers are lazy, they don't come into schools, or they're incapable, they actually don't know how to teach. Well, when we went inside schools, we found something completely different. On most days, most teachers were actually inside schools. And when you spoke with them, you realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes. But they were not teaching. I went to a school where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom and a toilet supervised. I went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids' accounts. At lunchtime, most teachers were spending all of their time getting the midday meal cooking, supervised and served to the students.So we asked the teachers, \"What's going on, why are you not teaching?\" And they said, \"This is what's expected of us. When a supervisor comes to visit us, these are exactly the things that he checks. Has the toilet been made, has the meal been served. When my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters, these are exactly the things which are discussed.\"You see, what had happened was, over the last two decades, India had been fighting the challenge of access, having enough schools, and enrollment, bringing children into the schools. So the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges, and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs. Not explicitly, but implicitly. And now, what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attendance but to tell them that what is most important is for them to go back inside classrooms and teach. They needed to be monitored and measured and awarded on the quality of teaching and not on all sorts of other things.So as we went through the education system, as we delved into it deeper, we found a few such core root causes which were determining, which were shaping how people behaved in the system. And we realized that unless we change those specific things, we could do a number of other things. We could train, we could put technology into schools, but the system wouldn't change. And addressing these non-obvious core issues became a key part of the program.So, we had the goal and we had the issues, and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were. We obviously did not want to recreate the wheel, so we said, \"Let's look around and see what we can find.\" And we found these beautiful, small pilot experiments all over the country and all over the world. Small things being done by NGOs, being done by foundations. But what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled. All of them were limited to 50, 100 or 500 schools. And here, we were looking for a solution for 15,000 schools.So we looked into why, if these things actually work, why don't they actually scale? What happens is that when a typical NGO comes in, they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources. So they might bring in money, they might bring in people, they might bring in technology. And in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in, those additional resources actually create a difference. But now imagine that the head of this NGO goes to the head of the School Education Department and says, \"Hey, now let's do this for 15,000 schools.\" Where is that guy or girl going to find the money to actually scale this up to 15,000 schools? He doesn't have the additional money, he doesn't have the resources. And hence, innovations don't scale. So right at the beginning of the project, what we said was, \"Whatever we have to do has to be scalable, it has to work in all 15,000 schools.\" And hence, it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has. Much easier said than done. (Laughter)I think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me. We spent a lot of long hours in office, in caf\u00e9s, sometimes even in bars, scratching out heads and saying, \"Where are the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem?\"In the end, I think we did find solutions to many of the issues. I'll give you an example. In the context of effective learning, one of the things people talk about is hands-on learning. Children shouldn't memorize things from books, they should do activities, and that's a more effective way to learn. Which basically means giving students things like beads, learning rods, abacuses. But we did not have the budgets to give that to 15,000 schools, 2 million children. We needed another solution. We couldn't think of anything. One day, one of our team members went to a school and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students. That was a huge eureka moment for us. So what happens now in the textbooks in Haryana is that after every concept, we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say, \"To teach this concept, here's an activity that you can do. And by the way, in order to actually do this activity, here are things that you can use from your immediate environment, whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside, which can be used as learning aids for kids.\" And we see teachers all over Haryana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students. So in this way, whatever we designed, we were actually able to implement it across all 15,000 schools from day one.Now, this brings me to my last point. How do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers? The department used to have a process which is very interesting. I like to call it \"The Chain of Hope.\" They would write a letter from the headquarters and send it to the next level, which was the district offices. They would hope that in each of these district offices, an officer would get the letter, would open it, read it and then forward it to the next level, which was the block offices. And then you would hope that at the block office, somebody else got the letter, opened it, read it and forwarded it eventually to the 15,000 principals. And then one would hope that the principals got the letter, received it, understood it and started implementing it. It was a little bit ridiculous. Now, we knew technology was the answer, but we also knew that most of these schools don't have a computer or email. However, what the teachers do have are smartphones. They're constantly on SMS, on Facebook and on WhatsApp.So what now happens in Haryana is, all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups and anytime something needs to be communicated, it's just posted across all WhatsApp groups. It spreads like wildfire. You can immediately check who has received it, who has read it. Teachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously. And what's interesting is, it's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions. Another teacher from a completely different part of the state will stand up and answer the question. Everybody's acting as everybody's peer group, and things are getting implemented. So today, when you go to a school in Haryana, things look different. The teachers are back inside classrooms, they're teaching. Often with innovative techniques. When a supervisor comes to visit the classroom, he or she not only checks the construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teaching. Once a quarter, all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded. And schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult conversations. Of course, they also get additional support to be able to do better in the future. In the context of education, it's very difficult to see results quickly.When people talk about systemic, large-scale change, they talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years. But not in Haryana. In the last one year, there have been three independent studies, all measuring student learning outcomes, which indicate that something fundamental, something unique is happening in Haryana. Learning levels of children have stopped declining, and they have started going up. Haryana is one of the few states in the country which is showing an improvement, and certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement. These are still early signs, there's a long way to go, but this gives us a lot of hope for the future. I recently went to a school, and as I was leaving, I ran into a lady, her name was Parvati, she was the mother of a child, and she was smiling. And I said, \"Why are you smiling, what's going on?\" And she said, \"I don't know what's going on, but what I do know is that my children are learning, they're having fun, and for the time being, I'll stop my search for a private school to send them to.\"So I go back to where I started: Can government systems transform? I certainly believe so. I think if you give them the right levers, they can move mountains.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2526, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.717 -->

goal,\n\n00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:36.040\nand now we needed to figure out\nwhat are the issues, what is broken.\n\n00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.686\nBefore we went into schools,\na lot of people told us\n\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.776\nthat education quality is poor\n\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.674\nbecause either the teachers are lazy,\nthey don't come into schools,\n\n00:04:45.698 --> 00:04:48.932\nor they're incapable,\nthey actually don't know how to teach.\n\n00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:53.668\nWell, when we went inside schools,\nwe found something completely different.\n\n00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:57.275\nOn most days, most teachers\nwere actually inside schools.\n\n00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.308\nAnd when you spoke with them,\n\n00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:03.143\nyou realized they were perfectly capable\nof teaching elementary classes.\n\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.714\nBut they were not teaching.\n\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.059\nI went to a school\n\n00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:11.167\nwhere the teachers were getting\nthe construction of a classroom\n\n00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:13.269\nand a toilet supervised.\n\n00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:15.245\nI went to another school\n\n00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:18.160\nwhere two of the teachers\nhad gone to a nearby bank branch\n\n00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:20.926\nto deposit scholarship money\ninto kids' accounts.\n\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.701\nAt lunchtime, most teachers\nwere spending all of their time\n\n00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:29.826\ngetting the midday meal cooking,\nsupervised and served to the students.\n\n00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.069\nSo we asked the teachers,\n\n00:05:32.093 --> 00:05:34.841\n\"What's going on,\nwhy are you not teaching?\"\n\n00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:37.341\nAnd they said, \"This is\nwhat's expected of us.\n\n00:05:38.458 --> 00:05:40.769\nWhen a supervisor comes to visit us,\n\n00:05:40.793 --> 00:05:43.182\nthese are exactly the things\nthat he checks.\n\n00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:45.886\nHas the toilet been made,\nhas the meal been served.\n\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.020\nWhen my principal\ngoes to a meeting at headquarters,\n\n00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:51.431\nthese are exactly the things\nwhich are discussed.\"\n\n00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.463\nYou see, what had happened was,\nover the last two decades,\n\n00:05:56.487 --> 00:06:00.317\nIndia had been fighting the challenge\nof access, having enough schools,\n\n00:06:00.341 --> 00:06:03.112\nand enrollment, bringing children\ninto the schools.\n\n00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:06.566\nSo the government\nlaunched a whole host of programs\n\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.449\nto address these challenges,\n\n00:06:08.473 --> 00:06:13.230\nand the teachers became\nthe implicit executors of these programs.\n\n00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:15.402\nNot explicitly, but implicitly.\n\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.626\nAnd now, what was actually needed\nwas not to actually train teachers further\n\n00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.549\nor to monitor their attendance\n\n00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:27.444\nbut to tell them\nthat what is most important\n\n00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:30.068\nis for them to go back\ninside classrooms and teach.\n\n00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:33.946\nThey needed to be monitored\nand measured and awarded\n\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.318\non the quality of teaching\n\n00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:37.185\nand not on all sorts of other things.\n\n00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:40.436\nSo as we went through\nthe education system,\n\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.720\nas we delved into it deeper,\nwe found a few such core root causes\n\n00:06:45.744 --> 00:06:49.876\nwhich were determining, which were\nshaping how people behaved in the system.\n\n00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.583\nAnd we realized that unless we change\nthose specific things,\n\n00:06:53.607 --> 00:06:55.560\nwe could do a number of other things.\n\n00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:58.427\nWe could train, we could put\ntechnology into schools,\n\n00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.431\nbut the system wouldn't change.\n\n00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:03.512\nAnd addressing these non-obvious\ncore issues\n\n00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:05.345\nbecame a key part of the program.\n\n00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:09.588\nSo, we had the goal and we had the issues,\n\n00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:12.361\nand now we needed to figure out\nwhat the solutions were.\n\n00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.284\nWe obviously did not want\nto recreate the wheel,\n\n00:07:15.308 --> 00:07:18.058\nso we said, \"Let's look around\nand see what we can find.\"\n\n00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:23.345\nAnd we found these beautiful,\nsmall pilot experiments\n\n00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:25.540\nall over the country\nand all over the world.\n\n00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:30.072\nSmall things being done by NGOs,\nbeing done by foundations.\n\n00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:34.053\nBut what was also interesting\nwas that none of them actually scaled.\n\n00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:37.615\nAll of them were limited\nto 50, 100 or 500 schools.\n\n00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:40.679\nAnd here, we were looking\nfor a solution for 15,000 schools.\n\n00:07:41.138 --> 00:07:42.842\nSo we looked into why,\n\n00:07:42.866 --> 00:07:45.981\nif these things actually work,\nwhy don't they actually scale?\n\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.765\nWhat happens is that\nwhen a typical NGO comes in,\n\n00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.202\nthey not only bring in their expertise\n\n00:07:52.226 --> 00:07:54.741\nbut they also bring in\nadditional resources.\n\n00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:56.522\nSo they might bring in money,\n\n00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:57.867\nthey might bring in people,\n\n00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:59.585\nthey might bring in technology.\n\n00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:03.998\nAnd in the 50 or 100 schools\nthat they actually operate in,\n\n00:08:04.022 --> 00:08:06.882\nthose additional resources\nactually create a difference.\n\n00:08:07.434 --> 00:08:09.966\nBut now imagine that the head of this NGO\n\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.745\ngoes to the head\nof the School Education Department\n\n00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:16.034\nand says, \"Hey, now let's do this\nfor 15,000 schools.\"\n\n00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:19.511\nWhere is that guy or girl\ngoing to find the money\n\n00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:22.239\nto actually scale this up\nto 15,000 schools?\n\n00:08:22.263 --> 00:08:24.025\nHe doesn't have the additional money,\n\n00:08:24.049 --> 00:08:25.646\nhe doesn't have the resources.\n\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.021\nAnd hence, innovations don't scale.\n\n00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:32.299\nSo right at the beginning\nof the project, what we said was,\n\n00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:34.969\n\"Whatever we have to do\nhas to be scalable,\n\n00:08:34.993 --> 00:08:38.280\nit has to work in all 15,000 schools.\"\n\n00:08:38.304 --> 00:08:42.096\nAnd hence, it has to work\nwithin the existing budgets\n\n00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.651\nand resources that the state actually has.\n\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.385\nMuch easier said than done.\n\n00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:48.798\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:50.978\nI think this was definitely\nthe point in time\n\n00:08:51.002 --> 00:08:52.846\nwhen my team hated me.\n\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:58.048\nWe spent a lot of long hours\nin office, in caf\u00e9s,\n\n00:08:58.072 --> 00:08:59.367\nsometimes even in bars,\n\n00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:01.054\nscratching out heads and saying,\n\n00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:04.344\n\"Where are the solutions,\nhow are we going to solve this problem?\"\n\n00:09:04.368 --> 00:09:08.148\nIn the end, I think we did\nfind solutions to many of the issues.\n\n00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:10.045\nI'll give you an example.\n\n00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:12.011\nIn the context of effective learning,\n\n00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:15.320\none of the things people talk about\nis hands-on learning.\n\n00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:17.612\nChildren shouldn't memorize\nthings from books,\n\n00:09:17.636 --> 00:09:19.225\nthey should do activities,\n\n00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:21.248\nand that's a more effective way to learn.\n\n00:09:21.272 --> 00:09:23.570\nWhich basically means\ngiving students things\n\n00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:27.016\nlike beads, learning rods, abacuses.\n\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.494\nBut we did not have\nthe budgets to give that\n\n00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:32.133\nto 15,000 schools, 2 million children.\n\n00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:33.860\nWe needed another solution.\n\n00:09:34.404 --> 00:09:35.950\nWe couldn't think of anything.\n\n00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:39.155\nOne day, one of our team members\nwent to a school\n\n00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:43.545\nand saw a teacher pick up sticks\nand stones from the garden outside\n\n00:09:43.569 --> 00:09:45.390\nand take them into the classroom\n\n00:09:45.414 --> 00:09:46.926\nand give them to the students.\n\n00:09:47.684 --> 00:09:50.591\nThat was a huge eureka moment for us.\n\n00:09:51.575 --> 00:09:54.458\nSo what happens now\nin the textbooks in Haryana\n\n00:09:54.482 --> 00:09:57.224\nis that after every concept,\nwe have a little box\n\n00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:59.636\nwhich are instructions\nfor the teachers which say,\n\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.816\n\"To teach this concept,\nhere's an activity that you can do.\n\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.927\nAnd by the way, in order\nto actually do this activity,\n\n00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:10.130\nhere are things that you can use\nfrom your immediate environment,\n\n00:10:10.154 --> 00:10:13.175\nwhether it be the garden outside\nor the classroom inside,\n\n00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:15.644\nwhich can be used\nas learning aids for kids.\"\n\n00:10:16.152 --> 00:10:18.598\nAnd we see teachers all over Haryana\n\n00:10:18.622 --> 00:10:21.872\nusing lots of innovative things\nto be able to teach students.\n\n00:10:22.575 --> 00:10:26.160\nSo in this way, whatever we designed,\n\n00:10:26.184 --> 00:10:28.262\nwe were actually able to implement it\n\n00:10:28.286 --> 00:10:31.090\nacross all 15,000 schools from day one.\n\n00:10:32.262 --> 00:10:34.448\nNow, this brings me to my last point.\n\n00:10:34.472 --> 00:10:37.745\nHow do you implement something\nacross 15,000 schools\n\n00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:39.526\nand 100,000 teachers?\n\n00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:42.337\nThe department used to have a process\n\n00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:43.635\nwhich is very interesting.\n\n00:10:43.659 --> 00:10:46.360\nI like to call it \"The Chain of Hope.\"\n\n00:10:48.198 --> 00:10:50.558\nThey would write a letter\nfrom the headquarters\n\n00:10:50.582 --> 00:10:52.207\nand send it to the next level,\n\n00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:53.714\nwhich was the district offices.\n\n00:10:54.144 --> 00:10:56.801\nThey would hope that in each\nof these district offices,\n\n00:10:56.825 --> 00:11:00.800\nan officer would get the letter,\nwould open it, read it\n\n00:11:00.824 --> 00:11:02.918\nand then forward it to the next level,\n\n00:11:02.942 --> 00:11:04.949\nwhich was the block offices.\n\n00:11:04.973 --> 00:11:08.738\nAnd then you would hope\nthat at the block office,\n\n00:11:08.762 --> 00:11:10.245\nsomebody else got the letter,\n\n00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:14.288\nopened it, read it and forwarded it\neventually to the 15,000 principals.\n\n00:11:14.312 --> 00:11:16.971\nAnd then one would hope\nthat the principals\n\n00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:19.642\ngot the letter, received it,\nunderstood it\n\n00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:21.596\nand started implementing it.\n\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.267\nIt was a little bit ridiculous.\n\n00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.103\nNow, we knew technology was the answer,\n\n00:11:27.127 --> 00:11:29.268\nbut we also knew\nthat most of these schools\n\n00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:31.369\ndon't have a computer or email.\n\n00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:35.538\nHowever, what the teachers do have\nare smartphones.\n\n00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:40.241\nThey're constantly on SMS,\non Facebook and on WhatsApp.\n\n00:11:40.608 --> 00:11:42.853\nSo what now happens in Haryana is,\n\n00:11:42.877 --> 00:11:47.497\nall principals and teachers are divided\ninto hundreds of WhatsApp groups\n\n00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:50.343\nand anytime something needs\nto be communicated,\n\n00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:52.788\nit's just posted across\nall WhatsApp groups.\n\n00:11:53.444 --> 00:11:55.645\nIt spreads like wildfire.\n\n00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:58.662\nYou can immediately check\nwho has received it,\n\n00:11:58.686 --> 00:11:59.976\nwho has read it.\n\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.860\nTeachers can ask clarification\nquestions instantaneously.\n\n00:12:03.884 --> 00:12:05.125\nAnd what's interesting is,\n\n00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:08.507\nit's not just the headquarters\nwho are answering these questions.\n\n00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:11.420\nAnother teacher from\na completely different part of the state\n\n00:12:11.444 --> 00:12:13.837\nwill stand up and answer the question.\n\n00:12:13.861 --> 00:12:16.541\nEverybody's acting\nas everybody's peer group,\n\n00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:18.359\nand things are getting implemented.\n\n00:12:19.742 --> 00:12:22.025\nSo today, when you go\nto a school in Haryana,\n\n00:12:22.049 --> 00:12:23.636\nthings look different.\n\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.090\nThe teachers are back inside classrooms,\n\n00:12:26.114 --> 00:12:27.418\nthey're teaching.\n\n00:12:27.442 --> 00:12:29.300\nOften with innovative techniques.\n\n00:12:29.698 --> 00:12:32.800\nWhen a supervisor\ncomes to visit the classroom,\n\n00:12:32.824 --> 00:12:36.691\nhe or she not only checks\nthe construction of the toilet\n\n00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.058\nbut also what is the quality of teaching.\n\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.166\nOnce a quarter,\nall students across the state\n\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.355\nare assessed on their learning outcomes\n\n00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:48.237\nand schools which are\ndoing well are rewarded.\n\n00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:50.730\nAnd schools which are not doing so well\n\n00:12:50.754 --> 00:12:53.159\nfind themselves having\ndifficult conversations.\n\n00:12:53.526 --> 00:12:55.605\nOf course, they also get\nadditional support\n\n00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:57.565\nto be able to do better in the future.\n\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.814\nIn the context of education,\n\n00:13:00.838 --> 00:13:03.205\nit's very difficult\nto see results quickly.\n\n00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:06.563\nWhen people talk about systemic,\nlarge-scale change,\n\n00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:10.166\nthey talk about periods\nof 7 years and 10 years.\n\n00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.455\nBut not in Haryana.\n\n00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:16.063\nIn the last one year, there have been\nthree independent studies,\n\n00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.666\nall measuring student learning outcomes,\n\n00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.997\nwhich indicate that something fundamental,\n\n00:13:21.021 --> 00:13:23.111\nsomething unique is happening in Haryana.\n\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.588\nLearning levels of children\nhave stopped declining,\n\n00:13:26.612 --> 00:13:28.415\nand they have started going up.\n\n00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:31.649\nHaryana is one of the few\nstates in the country\n\n00:13:31.673 --> 00:13:33.252\nwhich is showing an improvement,\n\n00:13:33.276 --> 00:13:36.979\nand certainly the one that is showing\nthe fastest rate of improvement.\n\n00:13:37.963 --> 00:13:39.331\nThese are still early signs,\n\n00:13:39.355 --> 00:13:40.549\nthere's a long way to go,\n\n00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:43.064\nbut this gives us a lot of hope\nfor the future.\n\n00:13:44.817 --> 00:13:46.380\nI recently went to a school,\n\n00:13:46.404 --> 00:13:48.347\nand as I was leaving,\n\n00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:49.522\nI ran into a

--> 00:13:56.695\nAnd I said, \"Why are you smiling,\nwhat's going on?\"\n\n00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:59.465\nAnd she said, \"I don't know\nwhat's going on,\n\n00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:02.576\nbut what I

The puzzle of personality", "duration": "915", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/brian_little_who_are_you_really_the_puzzle_of_personality", "transcript": "What an intriguing group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist.(Laughter)I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today.(Laughter)And I thought you might like to know who you are.(Laughter)But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us \u2014 each of you \u2014 is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person.Now, already you may be saying of yourself, \"I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere.\" Or you may say of yourself, \"I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit.\"(Laughter)But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent \"twitiness\" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so.One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, \"O\" stands for \"open to experience,\" versus those who are more closed. \"C\" stands for \"conscientiousness,\" in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life. \"E\" \u2014 \"extroversion,\" in contrast to more introverted people. \"A\" \u2014 \"agreeable individuals,\" in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable. And \"N\" \u2014 \"neurotic individuals,\" in contrast to those who are more stable.All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow.(Laughter)Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried, but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them.(Laughter)Those are the extroverts.Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature \u2014 our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you individually you \u2014 idiosyncratic \u2014 what I call your \"idiogenic\" nature.Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED \u2014 you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation \u2014 and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation.Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, \"I really need a cup of coffee,\" they're not kidding \u2014 they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in \u2014 and they've had some coffee \u2014 if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual.So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to \u2014 yes, you would? OK.(Laughter)There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute \u2014 oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study \u2014(Laughter)How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 \u2014 almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later \u2014 they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well.(Laughter)(Applause)We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes \"Charlie,\" and then \"Chuck,\" and then \"Chuckles Baby.\"(Laughter)Whereas for introverts, it remains \"Charles,\" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer \u2014 and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine \u2014 we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences \u2014(Laughter)More or less.(Laughter)As it were.(Laughter)Not to put too fine a point upon it \u2014 like that.When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't.(Laughter)Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be.(Laughter)And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening.We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me, \"What do you make of Michael?\" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic \"extrovert-ese.\" And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, \"Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for.\"(Laughter)Tom rolled his eyes and he said, \"Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!\"(Laughter)(Applause)Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain \"assholic\" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.(Laughter)But the extrovert says, \"If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one.\" And we go past each other.Now is this something that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're a certain type of person.I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have in our life \u2014 the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid \u2014 you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child.What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, \"What are your core projects in your life?\" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project, which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study.But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her \"Quiet\" book, in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts.(Laughter)I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came in beside me \u2014 not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over \u2014 and I could hear various evacuatory noises, which we hate \u2014 even our own, that's why we flush during as well as after.(Laughter)And then I heard this gravelly voice saying, \"Hey, is that Dr. Little?\"(Laughter)If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john.(Laughter)That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2530, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.262\nWhat an intriguing\ngroup of individuals you

body.\n\n00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:52.043\nCaffeine, for example, works much better\nwith extroverts than it does introverts.\n\n00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:55.246\nWhen extroverts come into the office\nat nine o'clock in the morning\n\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.155\nand say, \"I really need a cup of coffee,\"\n\n00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:59.330\nthey're not kidding --\n\n00:05:59.354 --> 00:06:00.527\nthey really do.\n\n00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:03.295\nIntroverts do not do as well,\n\n00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.836\nparticularly if the tasks\nthey're engaged in --\n\n00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:08.416\nand they've had some coffee --\n\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.578\nif those tasks are speeded,\n\n00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:12.481\nand if they're quantitative,\n\n00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:16.899\nintroverts may give the appearance\nof not being particularly quantitative.\n\n00:06:17.538 --> 00:06:19.178\nBut it's a misconstrual.\n\n00:06:19.202 --> 00:06:22.246\nSo here are the consequences\nthat are really quite intriguing:\n\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.353\nwe're not always what seem to be,\n\n00:06:24.377 --> 00:06:27.661\nand that takes me to my next point.\n\n00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.710\nI should say, before getting to this,\n\n00:06:30.734 --> 00:06:33.414\nsomething about sexual intercourse,\n\n00:06:33.438 --> 00:06:35.539\nalthough I may not have time.\n\n00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:38.435\nAnd so, if you would like me to --\n\n00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:39.610\nyes, you would?\n\n00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:40.785\nOK.\n\n00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:41.894\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:43.078\nThere are studies done\n\n00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:48.427\non the frequency with which\nindividuals engage in the conjugal act,\n\n00:06:49.364 --> 00:06:52.603\nas broken down by male, female;\nintrovert, extrovert.\n\n00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:54.209\nSo I ask you:\n\n00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:56.305\nHow many times per minute --\n\n00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.004\noh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study --\n\n00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:01.035\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:03.911\nHow many times per month\n\n00:07:06.673 --> 00:07:09.932\ndo introverted men engage in the act?\n\n00:07:10.444 --> 00:07:11.834\n3.0.\n\n00:07:11.858 --> 00:07:13.490\nExtroverted men?\n\n00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.124\nMore or less?\n\n00:07:15.574 --> 00:07:17.202\nYes, more.\n\n00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:19.932\n5.5 -- almost twice as much.\n\n00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:23.790\nIntroverted women: 3.1.\n\n00:07:23.814 --> 00:07:25.410\nExtroverted women?\n\n00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:28.780\nFrankly, speaking as an introverted male,\n\n00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:30.541\nwhich I will explain later --\n\n00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:32.146\nthey are heroic.\n\n00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:34.706\n7.5.\n\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.092\nThey not only handle\nall the male extroverts,\n\n00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:40.209\nthey pick up a few introverts as well.\n\n00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:42.129\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:42.153 --> 00:07:44.473\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:48.754 --> 00:07:53.055\nWe communicate differently,\nextroverts and introverts.\n\n00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:56.040\nExtroverts, when they interact,\n\n00:07:56.064 --> 00:08:00.529\nwant to have lots of social encounter\npunctuated by closeness.\n\n00:08:00.553 --> 00:08:03.544\nThey'd like to stand close\nfor comfortable communication.\n\n00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:06.704\nThey like to have a lot of eye contact,\n\n00:08:06.728 --> 00:08:08.072\nor mutual gaze.\n\n00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.406\nWe found in some research\n\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.428\nthat they use more diminutive terms\nwhen they meet somebody.\n\n00:08:13.831 --> 00:08:16.544\nSo when an extrovert meets a Charles,\n\n00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:19.453\nit rapidly becomes \"Charlie,\"\nand then \"Chuck,\"\n\n00:08:19.477 --> 00:08:21.156\nand then \"Chuckles Baby.\"\n\n00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.672\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.395\nWhereas for introverts,\n\n00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:29.324\nit remains \"Charles,\" until he's given\na pass to be more intimate\n\n00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:31.568\nby the person he's talking to.\n\n00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:34.787\nWe speak differently.\n\n00:08:36.892 --> 00:08:42.129\nExtroverts prefer black-and-white,\nconcrete, simple language.\n\n00:08:43.812 --> 00:08:47.606\nIntroverts prefer --\nand I must again tell you\n\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.987\nthat I am as extreme an introvert\nas you could possibly imagine --\n\n00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:54.528\nwe speak differently.\n\n00:08:54.552 --> 00:08:58.547\nWe prefer contextually complex,\n\n00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.503\ncontingent,\n\n00:09:00.527 --> 00:09:02.543\nweasel-word sentences --\n\n00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:03.590\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:04.976\nMore or less.\n\n00:09:05.343 --> 00:09:06.779\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:06.803 --> 00:09:08.003\nAs it were.\n\n00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:09.042\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:11.066\nNot to put too fine a point upon it --\n\n00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:12.979\nlike that.\n\n00:09:13.913 --> 00:09:15.315\nWhen we talk,\n\n00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:17.081\nwe sometimes talk past each other.\n\n00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.310\nI had a consulting contract\nI shared with a colleague\n\n00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:23.338\nwho's as different from me\nas two people can possibly be.\n\n00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:25.476\nFirst, his name is Tom.\n\n00:09:26.457 --> 00:09:27.671\nMine isn't.\n\n00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:28.966\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.921\nSecondly, he's six foot five.\n\n00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.897\nI have a tendency not to be.\n\n00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:33.964\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:33.988 --> 00:09:37.711\nAnd thirdly, he's as extroverted\na person as you could find.\n\n00:09:37.735 --> 00:09:40.115\nI am seriously introverted.\n\n00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:42.323\nI overload so much,\n\n00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:47.161\nI can't even have a cup of coffee\nafter three in the afternoon\n\n00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:49.473\nand expect to sleep in the evening.\n\n00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:54.088\nWe had seconded to this project\na fellow called Michael.\n\n00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:59.450\nAnd Michael almost brought\nthe project to a crashing halt.\n\n00:10:00.486 --> 00:10:04.282\nSo the person who seconded him\nasked Tom and me,\n\n00:10:05.202 --> 00:10:06.661\n\"What do you make of Michael?\"\n\n00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:08.955\nWell, I'll tell you\nwhat Tom said in a minute.\n\n00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:11.295\nHe spoke in classic \"extrovert-ese.\"\n\n00:10:11.913 --> 00:10:15.488\nAnd here is how extroverted ears\nheard what I said,\n\n00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:17.465\nwhich is actually pretty accurate.\n\n00:10:17.489 --> 00:10:21.749\nI said, \"Well Michael does have\na tendency at times\n\n00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:25.629\nof behaving in a way\nthat some of us might see\n\n00:10:26.447 --> 00:10:30.582\nas perhaps more assertive\nthan is normally called for.\"\n\n00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:33.209\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:33.569 --> 00:10:35.346\nTom rolled his eyes and he said,\n\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.899\n\"Brian, that's what I said:\n\n00:10:38.587 --> 00:10:39.987\nhe's an asshole!\"\n\n00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:42.188\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:42.212 --> 00:10:44.033\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:46.734\nNow, as an introvert,\n\n00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:51.939\nI might gently allude to certain\n\"assholic\" qualities\n\n00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:53.258\nin this man's behavior,\n\n00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:56.086\nbut I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.\n\n00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.886\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:59.186 --> 00:11:00.452\nBut the extrovert says,\n\n00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:03.350\n\"If he walks like one, if he talks\nlike one, I call him one.\"\n\n00:11:03.374 --> 00:11:04.786\nAnd we go past each other.\n\n00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:09.422\nNow is this something\nthat we should be heedful of?\n\n00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:10.612\nOf course.\n\n00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.220\nIt's important that we know this.\n\n00:11:12.244 --> 00:11:13.783\nIs that all we are?\n\n00:11:14.628 --> 00:11:16.669\nAre we just a bunch of traits?\n\n00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:18.783\nNo, we're not.\n\n00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:22.330\nRemember, you're like some other people\n\n00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.933\nand like no other person.\n\n00:11:25.445 --> 00:11:27.880\nHow about that idiosyncratic you?\n\n00:11:28.443 --> 00:11:31.694\nAs Elizabeth or as George,\n\n00:11:31.718 --> 00:11:34.598\nyou may share your extroversion\nor your neuroticism.\n\n00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:40.216\nBut are there some distinctively\nElizabethan features of your behavior,\n\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.437\nor Georgian of yours,\n\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.540\nthat make us understand you\nbetter than just a bunch of traits?\n\n00:11:48.198 --> 00:11:50.601\nThat make us love you?\n\n00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.413\nNot just because you're\na certain type of person.\n\n00:11:55.146 --> 00:11:57.770\nI'm uncomfortable putting\npeople in pigeonholes.\n\n00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:01.630\nI don't even think pigeons\nbelong in pigeonholes.\n\n00:12:03.193 --> 00:12:05.262\nSo what is it that makes us different?\n\n00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:10.859\nIt's the doings that we have\nin our life -- the personal projects.\n\n00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:13.182\nYou have a personal project right now,\n\n00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:16.292\nbut nobody may know it here.\n\n00:12:17.462 --> 00:12:19.270\nIt relates to your kid --\n\n00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:21.494\nyou've been back three times\nto the hospital,\n\n00:12:21.518 --> 00:12:23.414\nand they still don't know what's wrong.\n\n00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:26.655\nOr it could be your mom.\n\n00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.152\nAnd you'd been acting out of character.\n\n00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:31.738\nThese are free traits.\n\n00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:36.559\nYou're very agreeable,\nbut you act disagreeably\n\n00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:40.456\nin order to break down those barriers\nof administrative torpor\n\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.631\nin the hospital,\n\n00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:44.281\nto get something\nfor your mom or your child.\n\n00:12:45.772 --> 00:12:47.279\nWhat are these free traits?\n\n00:12:47.303 --> 00:12:49.873\nThey're where we enact a script\n\n00:12:49.897 --> 00:12:52.550\nin order to advance\na core project in our lives.\n\n00:12:53.702 --> 00:12:55.760\nAnd they are what matters.\n\n00:12:55.784 --> 00:12:58.056\nDon't ask people what type you are;\n\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.454\nask them, \"What are your core\nprojects in your life?\"\n\n00:13:01.478 --> 00:13:03.262\nAnd we enact those free traits.\n\n00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:04.601\nI'm an introvert,\n\n00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:09.211\nbut I have a core project,\nwhich is to profess.\n\n00:13:09.598 --> 00:13:10.806\nI'm a professor.\n\n00:13:11.756 --> 00:13:13.613\nAnd I adore my students,\n\n00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:16.625\nand I adore my field.\n\n00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:22.427\nAnd I can't wait to tell them\nabout what's new, what's exciting,\n\n00:13:23.324 --> 00:13:25.576\nwhat I can't wait to tell them about.\n\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.420\nAnd so I act in an extroverted way,\n\n00:13:27.444 --> 00:13:28.972\nbecause at eight in the morning,\n\n00:13:28.996 --> 00:13:31.340\nthe students need a little bit of humor,\n\n00:13:31.364 --> 00:13:34.086\na little bit of engagement\nto keep them going\n\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.561\nin arduous days of study.\n\n00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:37.672\nBut we need to be very careful\n\n00:13:38.414 --> 00:13:41.370\nwhen we act protractedly out of character.\n\n00:13:42.637 --> 00:13:47.369\nSometimes we may find\nthat we don't take care of ourselves.\n\n00:13:49.267 --> 00:13:53.881\nI find, for example, after a period\nof pseudo-extroverted behavior,\n\n00:13:53.905 --> 00:13:56.205\nI need to repair somewhere on my own.\n\n00:13:57.874 --> 00:14:00.993\nAs Susan Cain said in her \"Quiet\" book,\n\n00:14:01.017 --> 00:14:03.989\nin a chapter that featured\nthe strange Canadian professor\n\n00:14:04.013 --> 00:14:06.008\nwho was teaching at the time at Harvard,\n\n00:14:07.103 --> 00:14:08.763\nI sometimes go to the men's room\n\n00:14:08.787 --> 00:14:12.483\nto escape the slings and arrows\nof outrageous extroverts.\n\n00:14:13.027 --> 00:14:14.111\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:20.507\nI remember one particular day\nwhen I was retired to a cubicle,\n\n00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:22.456\ntrying to avoid overstimulation.\n\n00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:28.322\nAnd a real extrovert came\nin beside me -- not right in my cubicle,\n\n00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:30.301\nbut in the next cubicle over --\n\n00:14:30.325 --> 00:14:32.648\nand I could hear various\nevacuatory noises,\n\n00:14:32.672 --> 00:14:34.941\nwhich we hate -- even our own,\n\n00:14:34.965 --> 00:14:37.695\nthat's why we flush\nduring as well as after.\n\n00:14:37.719 --> 00:14:39.451\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:44.908\nAnd then I heard\nthis gravelly voice saying,\n\n00:14:44.932 --> 00:14:47.367\n\"Hey, is that Dr. Little?\"\n\n00:14:47.391 --> 00:14:49.320\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:50.622 --> 00:14:56.989\nIf anything is guaranteed\nto constipate an introvert for six months,\n\n00:14:57.013 --> 00:14:58.774\nit's talking on the john.\n\n00:14:58.798 -->

we're designing new products, services or businesses, the only time you'll know if they're any good, if the designs are good, is to see how they're used in the real world, in context.I'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields in north London. It's absolutely beautiful. There's a big open green space. There's Georgian buildings around the side. But then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle. People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge. Instead, they want to take the shortcut, and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.Now, this shortcut is called a desire path, and it's often the path of least resistance. I find them fascinating, because they're often the point where design and user experience diverge.Now at this point, I should apologize, because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere. But today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services. The first is in the capital city of Brazil \u2014 Brasilia. And it reminds me that sometimes, you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low friction. Now, Brasilia is fascinating. It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s. It was the golden age of flying, so he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there. Slightly worryingly, he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit. But if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia, just where the point is there, you see it's littered with desire paths. They're absolutely everywhere.Now, they thought that they had future-proofed this design. They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere \u2014 we'd be able to drive \u2014 so there was little need for walkways or pavements. But as you can see, there's a real need. These are very dangerous desire paths. If we just pick one, in the middle, you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic. It won't surprise you guys that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city. People are resourceful. They'll always find the low-friction route to save money, save time.Not all these desire paths are dangerous, I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow. Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty-free. It was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left, and just cut through to the right, cut through the desire path.The question that's interesting is: What do designers think when they see our behavior here? Do they think we're stupid? Do they think we're lazy? Or do they accept that this is the only truth? This is their product. We're effectively co-designing their product. So our job is to design for real needs at low friction, because if you don't, the customer will, anyway.The second desire path I wanted to share is at the University of California. And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it. Now, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths. I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart. So they're dashing to lectures. They'll always find the shortcut. And the designers here knew that. So they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form. They then paved them. (Laughter) Incredibly smart approach. In fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want.For example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant. But where should it be? What should the menu be? He launched a service, in this case a food truck, and he changed the location each day. He'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker to figure out what people wanted. He now has a chain of restaurants. So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths.The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you is the UNIH. It reminds me that the world's in flux, and we have to respond to those changes. So as you'll guess, this is a hospital. I've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department. The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right. This was a patient-centered organization, so they laid on cars for their patients. But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars. They were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels. This desire path that you see diagonally, formed. The patients even called it \"The Chemo Trail.\" Now, when the hospital saw this originally, they tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it. But after a while, they realized it was an important need they were meeting for their patients, so they paved it.And I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths. If we look back at the one in North London again, that desire path hasn't always been there. The reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium on game days, from the Underground station you see on the bottom right. So you see the desire path. If we just wind the clock back a few years, when the stadium was being constructed, there is no desire path.So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging, and, where appropriate, pave them, as someone did here. Someone installed a barrier, people started walking across and round the bottom as you see, and they paved it.(Laughter)But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well, that, actually, the world is in flux. It's constantly changing, because if you look at the top of this image, there's another desire path forming.So these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs. I think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success. Design for real needs and design them in low friction, because if you don't offer them in low friction, someone else will, often the customer.Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service. The answer is rarely inside the building. Get out there and see what people really want.And finally, in part because of technology, the world is incredibly flux at the moment. It's changing constantly. These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever. Our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2531, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.729 -->

"transcript": "Once there was a star. Like everything else, she was born; grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time. Exactly how long, people cannot really tell. Just like everything in life, she reached the end of her regular star days when her heart, the core of her life, exhausted its fuel. But that was no end.She transformed into a supernova, and in the process releasing a tremendous amount of energy, outshining the rest of the galaxy and emitting, in one second, the same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days. And she evolved into another role in our galaxy.Supernova explosions are very extreme. But the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme. In the process of becoming a supernova, the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster, like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body. In that way, it starts rotating very fast and it increases, powerfully, its magnetic field. The matter around the star is dragged around, and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further. In that way, our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy in brightness and gamma ray emission.My star, the one in my story, became what is known as a magnetar. And just for your information, the magnetic field of a magnetar is 1,000 trillion times the magnetic field of Earth. The most energetic events ever measured by astronomers carry the name gamma-ray bursts because we observe them as bursts most or explosions, most strongly measured as gamma-ray light. Our star, like the one in our story that became a magnetar, is detected as a gamma-ray burst during the most energetic portion of the explosion. Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts are the strongest events ever measured by astronomers, we cannot see them with our naked eye. We depend, we rely on other methods in order to study this gamma-ray light. We cannot see them with our naked eye. We can only see an itty bitty, tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light. And beyond that, we rely on other methods.Yet as astronomers, we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods to do that. On the screen, it may look like this. You're seeing a plot. That is a light curve. It's a plot of intensity of light over time. It is a gamma-ray light curve. Sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time. On the left, you will be seeing the light intensity without a burst, and on the right, you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst.Early during my career, I could also see this kind of plot. But then, I lost my sight. I completely lost my sight because of extended illness, and with it, I lost the opportunity to see this plot and the opportunity to do my physics. It was a very strong transition for me in many ways. And professionally, it left me without a way to do my science. I longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light and figure out the astrophysical cause. I wanted to experience the spacious wonder, the excitement, the joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event.I thought long and hard about it, when I suddenly realized that all a light curve is, is a table of numbers converted into a visual plot. So along with my collaborators, we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound. I achieved access to the data, and today I'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer, using sound. And what people have been able to do, mainly visually, for hundreds of years, now I do it using sound.(Applause) Listening to this gamma-ray burst that you're seeing on the \u2014 (Applause continues)Thank you.Listening to this burst that you're seeing on the screen brought something to the ear beyond the obvious burst. Now I'm going to play the burst for you. It's not music, it's sound.(Digital beeping sounds)This is scientific data converted into sound, and it's mapped in pitch. The process is called sonification.So listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst. When I examine the very strong low-frequency regions, or bass line \u2014 I'm zooming into the bass line now. We noted resonances characteristic of electrically charged gasses like the solar wind. And I want you to hear what I heard. You will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume. And because you're sighted, I'm giving you a red line indicating what intensity of light is being converted into sound.(Digital hum and whistling sound)The (Whistles) is frogs at home, don't pay attention to that.(Laughter)(Digital hum and whistling sound)I think you heard it, right?So what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances, which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited, that depend on the volume. You may remember that I said that the matter around the star is dragged around? It transmits power with frequency and field distribution determined by the dimensions. You may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar. If this is the case, then outflows from the exploding star may be associated with this gamma-ray burst.What does that mean? That star formation may be a very important part of these supernova explosions. Listening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display may also support sighted astronomers in the search for more information in the data. Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes, and my experiments demonstrated that when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display, astronomers can find more information in this now more accessible data set. This ability to transform data into sound gives astronomy a tremendous power of transformation. And the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved in order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens is a spirit-lifter.When I lost my sight, I noticed that I didn't have access to the same amount and quality of information a sighted astronomer had. It was not until we innovated with the sonification process that I regained the hope to be a productive member of the field that I had worked so hard to be part of.Yet, information access is not the only area in astronomy where this is important. The situation is systemic and scientific fields are not keeping up. The body is something changeable \u2014 anyone may develop a disability at any point. Let's think about, for example, scientists that are already at the top of their careers. What happens to them if they develop a disability? Will they feel excommunicated as I did? Information access empowers us to flourish. It gives us equal opportunities to display our talents and choose what we want to do with our lives, based on interest and not based on potential barriers. When we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits, that will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life. And I think that the use of sound in astronomy is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.While other countries told me that the study of perception techniques in order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy because there are no blind astronomers in the field, South Africa said, \"We want people with disabilities to contribute to the field.\" Right now, I'm working at the South African Astronomical Observatory, at the Office of Astronomy for Development. There, we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods to impact the students of the Athlone School for the Blind. These students will be learning radio astronomy, and they will be learning the sonification methods in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy from the sun, known as coronal mass ejections. What we learn with these students \u2014 these students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies that will be accommodated \u2014 what we learn with these students will directly impact the way things are being done at the professional level. I humbly call this development. And this is happening right now.I think that science is for everyone. It belongs to the people, and it has to be available to everyone, because we are all natural explorers. I think that if we limit people with disabilities from participating in science, we'll sever our links with history and with society. I dream of a level scientific playing field, where people encourage respect and respect each other, where people exchange strategies and discover together. If people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field, an explosion, a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place, I am sure.(Digital beeping sounds)That is the titanic burst.Thank you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2534, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:15.387\nOnce there was a star.\n\n00:00:16.040 -->

engineering discipline of making computers and devices able to do some of the things that brains do. And this makes us interested in real brains and neuroscience as well, and especially interested in the things that our brains do that are still far superior to the performance of computers.Historically, one of those areas has been perception, the process by which things out there in the world \u2014 sounds and images \u2014 can turn into concepts in the mind. This is essential for our own brains, and it's also pretty useful on a computer. The machine perception algorithms, for example, that our team makes, are what enable your pictures on Google Photos to become searchable, based on what's in them. The flip side of perception is creativity: turning a concept into something out there into the world. So over the past year, our work on machine perception has also unexpectedly connected with the world of machine creativity and machine art.I think Michelangelo had a penetrating insight into to this dual relationship between perception and creativity. This is a famous quote of his: \"Every block of stone has a statue inside of it, and the job of the sculptor is to discover it.\" So I think that what Michelangelo was getting at is that we create by perceiving, and that perception itself is an act of imagination and is the stuff of creativity.The organ that does all the thinking and perceiving and imagining, of course, is the brain. And I'd like to begin with a brief bit of history about what we know about brains. Because unlike, say, the heart or the intestines, you really can't say very much about a brain by just looking at it, at least with the naked eye. The early anatomists who looked at brains gave the superficial structures of this thing all kinds of fanciful names, like hippocampus, meaning \"little shrimp.\" But of course that sort of thing doesn't tell us very much about what's actually going on inside.The first person who, I think, really developed some kind of insight into what was going on in the brain was the great Spanish neuroanatomist, Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, in the 19th century, who used microscopy and special stains that could selectively fill in or render in very high contrast the individual cells in the brain, in order to start to understand their morphologies. And these are the kinds of drawings that he made of neurons in the 19th century.This is from a bird brain. And you see this incredible variety of different sorts of cells, even the cellular theory itself was quite new at this point. And these structures, these cells that have these arborizations, these branches that can go very, very long distances \u2014 this was very novel at the time. They're reminiscent, of course, of wires. That might have been obvious to some people in the 19th century; the revolutions of wiring and electricity were just getting underway. But in many ways, these microanatomical drawings of Ram\u00f3n y Cajal's, like this one, they're still in some ways unsurpassed.We're still more than a century later, trying to finish the job that Ram\u00f3n y Cajal started. These are raw data from our collaborators at the Max Planck Institute of Neuroscience. And what our collaborators have done is to image little pieces of brain tissue. The entire sample here is about one cubic millimeter in size, and I'm showing you a very, very small piece of it here. That bar on the left is about one micron. The structures you see are mitochondria that are the size of bacteria. And these are consecutive slices through this very, very tiny block of tissue. Just for comparison's sake, the diameter of an average strand of hair is about 100 microns. So we're looking at something much, much smaller than a single strand of hair.And from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices, one can start to make reconstructions in 3D of neurons that look like these. So these are sort of in the same style as Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. Only a few neurons lit up, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to see anything here. It would be so crowded, so full of structure, of wiring all connecting one neuron to another.So Ram\u00f3n y Cajal was a little bit ahead of his time, and progress on understanding the brain proceeded slowly over the next few decades. But we knew that neurons used electricity, and by World War II, our technology was advanced enough to start doing real electrical experiments on live neurons to better understand how they worked. This was the very same time when computers were being invented, very much based on the idea of modeling the brain \u2014 of \"intelligent machinery,\" as Alan Turing called it, one of the fathers of computer science.Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts looked at Ram\u00f3n y Cajal's drawing of visual cortex, which I'm showing here. This is the cortex that processes imagery that comes from the eye. And for them, this looked like a circuit diagram. So there are a lot of details in McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram that are not quite right. But this basic idea that visual cortex works like a series of computational elements that pass information one to the next in a cascade, is essentially correct.Let's talk for a moment about what a model for processing visual information would need to do. The basic task of perception is to take an image like this one and say, \"That's a bird,\" which is a very simple thing for us to do with our brains. But you should all understand that for a computer, this was pretty much impossible just a few years ago. The classical computing paradigm is not one in which this task is easy to do.So what's going on between the pixels, between the image of the bird and the word \"bird,\" is essentially a set of neurons connected to each other in a neural network, as I'm diagramming here. This neural network could be biological, inside our visual cortices, or, nowadays, we start to have the capability to model such neural networks on the computer. And I'll show you what that actually looks like.So the pixels you can think about as a first layer of neurons, and that's, in fact, how it works in the eye \u2014 that's the neurons in the retina. And those feed forward into one layer after another layer, after another layer of neurons, all connected by synapses of different weights. The behavior of this network is characterized by the strengths of all of those synapses. Those characterize the computational properties of this network. And at the end of the day, you have a neuron or a small group of neurons that light up, saying, \"bird.\"Now I'm going to represent those three things \u2014 the input pixels and the synapses in the neural network, and bird, the output \u2014 by three variables: x, w and y. There are maybe a million or so x's \u2014 a million pixels in that image. There are billions or trillions of w's, which represent the weights of all these synapses in the neural network. And there's a very small number of y's, of outputs that that network has. \"Bird\" is only four letters, right? So let's pretend that this is just a simple formula, x \"x\" w = y. I'm putting the times in scare quotes because what's really going on there, of course, is a very complicated series of mathematical operations.That's one equation. There are three variables. And we all know that if you have one equation, you can solve one variable by knowing the other two things. So the problem of inference, that is, figuring out that the picture of a bird is a bird, is this one: it's where y is the unknown and w and x are known. You know the neural network, you know the pixels. As you can see, that's actually a relatively straightforward problem. You multiply two times three and you're done. I'll show you an artificial neural network that we've built recently, doing exactly that.This is running in real time on a mobile phone, and that's, of course, amazing in its own right, that mobile phones can do so many billions and trillions of operations per second. What you're looking at is a phone looking at one after another picture of a bird, and actually not only saying, \"Yes, it's a bird,\" but identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort. So in that picture, the x and the w are known, and the y is the unknown. I'm glossing over the very difficult part, of course, which is how on earth do we figure out the w, the brain that can do such a thing? How would we ever learn such a model?So this process of learning, of solving for w, if we were doing this with the simple equation in which we think about these as numbers, we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w, well, we divide by two and we're done. The problem is with this operator. So, division \u2014 we've used division because it's the inverse to multiplication, but as I've just said, the multiplication is a bit of a lie here. This is a very, very complicated, very non-linear operation; it has no inverse. So we have to figure out a way to solve the equation without a division operator. And the way to do that is fairly straightforward. You just say, let's play a little algebra trick, and move the six over to the right-hand side of the equation. Now, we're still using multiplication. And that zero \u2014 let's think about it as an error. In other words, if we've solved for w the right way, then the error will be zero. And if we haven't gotten it quite right, the error will be greater than zero.So now we can just take guesses to minimize the error, and that's the sort of thing computers are very good at. So you've taken an initial guess: what if w = 0? Well, then the error is 6. What if w = 1? The error is 4. And then the computer can sort of play Marco Polo, and drive down the error close to zero. As it does that, it's getting successive approximations to w. Typically, it never quite gets there, but after about a dozen steps, we're up to w = 2.999, which is close enough. And this is the learning process.So remember that what's been going on here is that we've been taking a lot of known x's and known y's and solving for the w in the middle through an iterative process. It's exactly the same way that we do our own learning. We have many, many images as babies and we get told, \"This is a bird; this is not a bird.\" And over time, through iteration, we solve for w, we solve for those neural connections.So now, we've held x and w fixed to solve for y; that's everyday, fast perception. We figure out how we can solve for w, that's learning, which is a lot harder, because we need to do error minimization, using a lot of training examples.And about a year ago, Alex Mordvintsev, on our team, decided to experiment with what happens if we try solving for x, given a known w and a known y. In other words, you know that it's a bird, and you already have your neural network that you've trained on birds, but what is the picture of a bird? It turns out that by using exactly the same error-minimization procedure, one can do that with the network trained to recognize birds, and the result turns out to be ... a picture of birds. So this is a picture of birds generated entirely by a neural network that was trained to recognize birds, just by solving for x rather than solving for y, and doing that iteratively.Here's another fun example. This was a work made by Mike Tyka in our group, which he calls \"Animal Parade.\" It reminds me a little bit of William Kentridge's artworks, in which he makes sketches, rubs them out, makes sketches, rubs them out, and creates a movie this way. In this case, what Mike is doing is varying y over the space of different animals, in a network designed to recognize and distinguish different animals from each other. And you get this strange, Escher-like morph from one animal to another.Here he and Alex together have tried reducing the y's to a space of only two dimensions, thereby making a map out of the space of all things recognized by this network. Doing this kind of synthesis or generation of imagery over that entire surface, varying y over the surface, you make a kind of map \u2014 a visual map of all the things the network knows how to recognize. The animals are all here; \"armadillo\" is right in that spot.You can do this with other kinds of networks as well. This is a network designed to recognize faces, to distinguish one face from another. And here, we're putting in a y that says, \"me,\" my own face parameters. And when this thing solves for x, it generates this rather crazy, kind of cubist, surreal, psychedelic picture of me from multiple points of view at once. The reason it looks like multiple points of view at once is because that network is designed to get rid of the ambiguity of a face being in one pose or another pose, being looked at with one kind of lighting, another kind of lighting. So when you do this sort of reconstruction, if you don't use some sort of guide image or guide statistics, then you'll get a sort of confusion of different points of view, because it's ambiguous. This is what happens if Alex uses his own face as a guide image during that optimization process to reconstruct my own face. So you can see it's not perfect. There's still quite a lot of work to do on how we optimize that optimization process. But you start to get something more like a coherent face, rendered using my own face as a guide.You don't have to start with a blank canvas or with white noise. When you're solving for x, you can begin with an x, that is itself already some other image. That's what this little demonstration is. This is a network that is designed to categorize all sorts of different objects \u2014 man-made structures, animals ... Here we're starting with just a picture of clouds, and as we optimize, basically, this network is figuring out what it sees in the clouds. And the more time you spend looking at this, the more things you also will see in the clouds. You could also use the face network to hallucinate into this, and you get some pretty crazy stuff.(Laughter)Or, Mike has done some other experiments in which he takes that cloud image, hallucinates, zooms, hallucinates, zooms hallucinates, zooms. And in this way, you can get a sort of fugue state of the network, I suppose, or a sort of free association, in which the network is eating its own tail. So every image is now the basis for, \"What do I think I see next? What do I think I see next? What do I think I see next?\"I showed this for the first time in public to a group at a lecture in Seattle called \"Higher Education\" \u2014 this was right after marijuana was legalized.(Laughter)So I'd like to finish up quickly by just noting that this technology is not constrained. I've shown you purely visual examples because they're really fun to look at. It's not a purely visual technology. Our artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin, has done experiments involving a camera that takes a picture, and then a computer in his backpack writes a poem using neural networks, based on the contents of the image. And that poetry neural network has been trained on a large corpus of 20th-century poetry. And the poetry is, you know, I think, kind of not bad, actually.(Laughter)In closing, I think that per Michelangelo, I think he was right; perception and creativity are very intimately connected. What we've just seen are neural networks that are entirely trained to discriminate, or to recognize different things in the world, able to be run in reverse, to generate. One of the things that suggests to me is not only that Michelangelo really did see the sculpture in the blocks of stone, but that any creature, any being, any alien that is able to do perceptual acts of that sort is also able to create because it's exactly the same machinery that's used in both cases.Also, I think that perception and creativity are by no means uniquely human. We start to have computer models that can do exactly these sorts of things. And that ought to be unsurprising; the brain is computational.And finally, computing began as an exercise in designing intelligent machinery. It was very much modeled after the idea of how could we make machines intelligent. And we finally are starting to fulfill now some of the promises of those early pioneers, of Turing and von Neumann and McCulloch and Pitts. And I think that computing is not just about accounting or playing Candy Crush or something. From the beginning, we modeled them after our minds. And they give us both the ability to understand our own minds better and to extend them.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2533, "subtitle":

creativity\n\n00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:19.753\nand machine art.\n\n00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:23.798\nI think Michelangelo\nhad a penetrating insight\n\n00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:27.478\ninto to this dual relationship\nbetween perception and creativity.\n\n00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:29.987\nThis is a famous quote of his:\n\n00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:33.334\n\"Every block of stone\nhas a statue inside of it,\n\n00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:36.996\nand the job of the sculptor\nis to discover it.\"\n\n00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:41.203\nSo I think that what\nMichelangelo was getting at\n\n00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:44.407\nis that we create by perceiving,\n\n00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:47.454\nand that perception itself\nis an act of imagination\n\n00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:49.939\nand is the stuff of creativity.\n\n00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.574\nThe organ that does all the thinking\nand perceiving and imagining,\n\n00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:56.186\nof course, is the brain.\n\n00:01:57.047 --> 00:01:59.592\nAnd I'd like to begin\nwith a brief bit of history\n\n00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:01.918\nabout what we know about brains.\n\n00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.900\nBecause unlike, say,\nthe heart or the intestines,\n\n00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:08.068\nyou really can't say very much\nabout a brain by just looking at it,\n\n00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:09.504\nat least with the naked eye.\n\n00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:12.357\nThe early anatomists who looked at brains\n\n00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:16.188\ngave the superficial structures\nof this thing all kinds of fanciful names,\n\n00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:18.645\nlike hippocampus, meaning \"little shrimp.\"\n\n00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.433\nBut of course that sort of thing\ndoesn't tell us very much\n\n00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:23.775\nabout what's actually going on inside.\n\n00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:28.351\nThe first person who, I think, really\ndeveloped some kind of insight\n\n00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.305\ninto what was going on in the brain\n\n00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.249\nwas the great Spanish neuroanatomist,\nSantiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal,\n\n00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:35.817\nin the 19th century,\n\n00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:39.596\nwho used microscopy and special stains\n\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.790\nthat could selectively fill in\nor render in very high contrast\n\n00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:45.822\nthe individual cells in the brain,\n\n00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:49.000\nin order to start to understand\ntheir morphologies.\n\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.821\nAnd these are the kinds of drawings\nthat he made of neurons\n\n00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:54.054\nin the 19th century.\n\n00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:55.962\nThis is from a bird brain.\n\n00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:59.043\nAnd you see this incredible variety\nof different sorts of cells,\n\n00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:02.502\neven the cellular theory itself\nwas quite new at this point.\n\n00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:03.804\nAnd these structures,\n\n00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:06.087\nthese cells that have these arborizations,\n\n00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:08.719\nthese branches that can go\nvery, very long distances --\n\n00:03:08.743 --> 00:03:10.359\nthis was very novel at the time.\n\n00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:13.640\nThey're reminiscent, of course, of wires.\n\n00:03:13.664 --> 00:03:17.121\nThat might have been obvious\nto some people in the 19th century;\n\n00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:21.459\nthe revolutions of wiring and electricity\nwere just getting underway.\n\n00:03:21.922 --> 00:03:23.100\nBut in many ways,\n\n00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:26.437\nthese microanatomical drawings\nof Ram\u00f3n y Cajal's, like this one,\n\n00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:28.793\nthey're still in some ways unsurpassed.\n\n00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:30.671\nWe're still more than a century later,\n\n00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:33.520\ntrying to finish the job\nthat Ram\u00f3n y Cajal started.\n\n00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:36.678\nThese are raw data from our collaborators\n\n00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:39.583\nat the Max Planck Institute\nof Neuroscience.\n\n00:03:39.607 --> 00:03:41.397\nAnd what our collaborators have done\n\n00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:46.422\nis to image little pieces of brain tissue.\n\n00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:49.772\nThe entire sample here\nis about one cubic millimeter in size,\n\n00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.417\nand I'm showing you a very,\nvery small piece of it here.\n\n00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.787\nThat bar on the left is about one micron.\n\n00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:57.220\nThe structures you see are mitochondria\n\n00:03:57.244 --> 00:03:59.288\nthat are the size of bacteria.\n\n00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:00.863\nAnd these are consecutive slices\n\n00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:04.035\nthrough this very, very\ntiny block of tissue.\n\n00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.462\nJust for comparison's sake,\n\n00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:10.278\nthe diameter of an average strand\nof hair is about 100 microns.\n\n00:04:10.302 --> 00:04:12.576\nSo we're looking at something\nmuch, much smaller\n\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.998\nthan a single strand of hair.\n\n00:04:14.022 --> 00:04:18.053\nAnd from these kinds of serial\nelectron microscopy slices,\n\n00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:23.085\none can start to make reconstructions\nin 3D of neurons that look like these.\n\n00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:26.266\nSo these are sort of in the same\nstyle as Ram\u00f3n y Cajal.\n\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.782\nOnly a few neurons lit up,\n\n00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:30.587\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't\nbe able to see anything here.\n\n00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.923\nIt would be so crowded,\n\n00:04:31.947 --> 00:04:33.277\nso full of structure,\n\n00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:36.025\nof wiring all connecting\none neuron to another.\n\n00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:40.055\nSo Ram\u00f3n y Cajal was a little bit\nahead of his time,\n\n00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.634\nand progress on understanding the brain\n\n00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:44.929\nproceeded slowly\nover the next few decades.\n\n00:04:45.413 --> 00:04:48.266\nBut we knew that neurons used electricity,\n\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.226\nand by World War II, our technology\nwas advanced enough\n\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.056\nto start doing real electrical\nexperiments on live neurons\n\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.186\nto better understand how they worked.\n\n00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:00.945\nThis was the very same time\nwhen computers were being invented,\n\n00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.069\nvery much based on the idea\nof modeling the brain --\n\n00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:07.178\nof \"intelligent machinery,\"\nas Alan Turing called it,\n\n00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:09.193\none of the fathers of computer science.\n\n00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:14.513\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts\nlooked at Ram\u00f3n y Cajal's drawing\n\n00:05:14.537 --> 00:05:15.854\nof visual cortex,\n\n00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:17.440\nwhich I'm showing here.\n\n00:05:17.464 --> 00:05:21.906\nThis is the cortex that processes\nimagery that comes from the eye.\n\n00:05:22.382 --> 00:05:25.890\nAnd for them, this looked\nlike a circuit diagram.\n\n00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:30.146\nSo there are a lot of details\nin McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram\n\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.522\nthat are not quite right.\n\n00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:32.781\nBut this basic idea\n\n00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:36.797\nthat visual cortex works like a series\nof computational elements\n\n00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.567\nthat pass information\none to the next in a cascade,\n\n00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.193\nis essentially correct.\n\n00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:43.567\nLet's talk for a moment\n\n00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:47.623\nabout what a model for processing\nvisual information would need to do.\n\n00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:50.927\nThe basic task of perception\n\n00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:55.145\nis to take an image like this one and say,\n\n00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.345\n\"That's a bird,\"\n\n00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:59.243\nwhich is a very simple thing\nfor us to do with our brains.\n\n00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:02.688\nBut you should all understand\nthat for a computer,\n\n00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:05.799\nthis was pretty much impossible\njust a few years ago.\n\n00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.739\nThe classical computing paradigm\n\n00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:10.270\nis not one in which\nthis task is easy to do.\n\n00:06:11.324 --> 00:06:13.876\nSo what's going on between the pixels,\n\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.928\nbetween the image of the bird\nand the word \"bird,\"\n\n00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:20.766\nis essentially a set of neurons\nconnected to each other\n\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.945\nin a neural network,\n\n00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.192\nas I'm diagramming here.\n\n00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.488\nThis neural network could be biological,\ninside our visual cortices,\n\n00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:28.674\nor, nowadays, we start\nto have the capability\n\n00:06:28.698 --> 00:06:31.152\nto model such neural networks\non the computer.\n\n00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:34.145\nAnd I'll show you what\nthat actually looks like.\n\n00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.585\nSo the pixels you can think\nabout as a first layer of neurons,\n\n00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:39.848\nand that's, in fact,\nhow it works in the eye --\n\n00:06:39.872 --> 00:06:41.535\nthat's the neurons in the retina.\n\n00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:43.059\nAnd those feed forward\n\n00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:46.486\ninto one layer after another layer,\nafter another layer of neurons,\n\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.543\nall connected by synapses\nof different weights.\n\n00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:50.902\nThe behavior of this network\n\n00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:54.210\nis characterized by the strengths\nof all of those synapses.\n\n00:06:54.234 --> 00:06:57.522\nThose characterize the computational\nproperties of this network.\n\n00:06:57.546 --> 00:06:59.016\nAnd at the end of the day,\n\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.487\nyou have a neuron\nor a small group of neurons\n\n00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:03.158\nthat light up, saying, \"bird.\"\n\n00:07:03.782 --> 00:07:06.914\nNow I'm going to represent\nthose three things --\n\n00:07:06.938 --> 00:07:11.634\nthe input pixels and the synapses\nin the neural network,\n\n00:07:11.658 --> 00:07:13.243\nand bird, the output --\n\n00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:16.324\nby three variables: x, w and y.\n\n00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.622\nThere are maybe a million or so x's --\n\n00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.599\na million pixels in that image.\n\n00:07:20.623 --> 00:07:23.069\nThere are billions or trillions of w's,\n\n00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:26.514\nwhich represent the weights of all\nthese synapses in the neural network.\n\n00:07:26.538 --> 00:07:28.413\nAnd there's a very small number of y's,\n\n00:07:28.437 --> 00:07:30.295\nof outputs that that network has.\n\n00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.068\n\"Bird\" is only four letters, right?\n\n00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:36.472\nSo let's pretend that this\nis just a simple formula,\n\n00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:38.659\nx \"x\" w = y.\n\n00:07:38.683 --> 00:07:40.719\nI'm putting the times in scare quotes\n\n00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:43.023\nbecause what's really\ngoing on there, of course,\n\n00:07:43.047 --> 00:07:46.093\nis a very complicated series\nof mathematical operations.\n\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.351\nThat's one equation.\n\n00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.047\nThere are three variables.\n\n00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:52.797\nAnd we all know\nthat if you have one equation,\n\n00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.463\nyou can solve one variable\nby knowing the other two things.\n\n00:07:57.116 --> 00:08:00.496\nSo the problem of inference,\n\n00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.393\nthat is, figuring out\nthat the picture of a bird is a bird,\n\n00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:04.691\nis this one:\n\n00:08:04.715 --> 00:08:08.174\nit's where y is the unknown\nand w and x are known.\n\n00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:10.657\nYou know the neural network,\nyou know the pixels.\n\n00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:14.008\nAs you can see, that's actually\na relatively straightforward problem.\n\n00:08:14.032 --> 00:08:16.218\nYou multiply two times three\nand you're done.\n\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.943\nI'll show you an artificial neural network\n\n00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:21.263\nthat we've built recently,\ndoing exactly that.\n\n00:08:21.592 --> 00:08:24.452\nThis is running in real time\non a mobile phone,\n\n00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:27.789\nand that's, of course,\namazing in its own right,\n\n00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:31.281\nthat mobile phones can do so many\nbillions and trillions of operations\n\n00:08:31.305 --> 00:08:32.553\nper second.\n\n00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:34.192\nWhat you're looking at is a phone\n\n00:08:34.216 --> 00:08:37.763\nlooking at one after another\npicture of a bird,\n\n00:08:37.787 --> 00:08:40.502\nand actually not only saying,\n\"Yes, it's a bird,\"\n\n00:08:40.526 --> 00:08:43.937\nbut identifying the species of bird\nwith a network of this sort.\n\n00:08:44.848 --> 00:08:46.674\nSo in that picture,\n\n00:08:46.698 --> 00:08:50.500\nthe x and the w are known,\nand the y is the unknown.\n\n00:08:50.524 --> 00:08:53.032\nI'm glossing over the very\ndifficult part, of course,\n\n00:08:53.056 --> 00:08:56.917\nwhich is how on earth\ndo we figure out the w,\n\n00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:59.128\nthe brain that can do such a thing?\n\n00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:00.986\nHow would we ever learn such a model?\n\n00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:04.609\nSo this process of learning,\nof solving for w,\n\n00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:07.280\nif we were doing this\nwith the simple equation\n\n00:09:07.304 --> 00:09:09.304\nin which we think about these as numbers,\n\n00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:12.015\nwe know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w,\n\n00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:15.351\nwell, we divide by two and we're done.\n\n00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:18.179\nThe problem is with this operator.\n\n00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:19.932\nSo, division --\n\n00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:23.077\nwe've used division because\nit's the inverse to multiplication,\n\n00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.541\nbut as I've just said,\n\n00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:27.014\nthe multiplication is a bit of a lie here.\n\n00:09:27.038 --> 00:09:30.364\nThis is a very, very complicated,\nvery non-linear operation;\n\n00:09:30.388 --> 00:09:32.092\nit has no inverse.\n\n00:09:32.116 --> 00:09:35.266\nSo we have to figure out a way\nto solve the equation\n\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.314\nwithout a division operator.\n\n00:09:37.338 --> 00:09:39.681\nAnd the way to do that\nis fairly straightforward.\n\n00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:42.376\nYou just say, let's play\na little algebra trick,\n\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.306\nand move the six over\nto the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.156\nNow, we're still using multiplication.\n\n00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:51.213\nAnd that zero -- let's think\nabout it as an error.\n\n00:09:51.237 --> 00:09:53.752\nIn other words, if we've solved\nfor w the right way,\n\n00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:55.432\nthen the error will be zero.\n\n00:09:55.456 --> 00:09:57.394\nAnd if we haven't gotten it quite right,\n\n00:09:57.418 --> 00:09:59.167\nthe error will be greater than zero.\n\n00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:02.557\nSo now we can just take guesses\nto minimize the error,\n\n00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.268\nand that's the sort of thing\ncomputers are very good at.\n\n00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.885\nSo you've taken an initial guess:\n\n00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:08.065\nwhat if w = 0?\n\n00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:09.329\nWell, then the error is 6.\n\n00:10:09.353 --> 00:10:10.799\nWhat if w = 1? The error is 4.\n\n00:10:10.823 --> 00:10:13.190\nAnd then the computer can\nsort of play Marco Polo,\n\n00:10:13.214 --> 00:10:15.581\nand drive down the error close to zero.\n\n00:10:15.605 --> 00:10:18.979\nAs it does that, it's getting\nsuccessive approximations to w.\n\n00:10:19.003 --> 00:10:22.659\nTypically, it never quite gets there,\nbut after about a dozen steps,\n\n00:10:22.683 --> 00:10:27.307\nwe're up to w = 2.999,\nwhich is close enough.\n\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.074\nAnd this is the learning process.\n\n00:10:30.098 --> 00:10:32.828\nSo remember that what's been going on here\n\n00:10:32.852 --> 00:10:37.230\nis that we've been taking\na lot of known x's and known y's\n\n00:10:37.254 --> 00:10:40.708\nand solving for the w in the middle\nthrough an iterative process.\n\n00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:44.288\nIt's exactly the same way\nthat we do our own learning.\n\n00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:46.542\nWe have many, many images as babies\n\n00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:49.199\nand we get told, \"This is a bird;\nthis is not a bird.\"\n\n00:10:49.672 --> 00:10:51.770\nAnd over time, through iteration,\n\n00:10:51.794 --> 00:10:54.722\nwe solve for w, we solve\nfor those neural connections.\n\n00:10:55.418 --> 00:10:59.504\nSo now, we've held\nx and w fixed to solve for y;\n\n00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:01.375\nthat's everyday, fast perception.\n\n00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:03.162\nWe figure out how we can solve for w,\n\n00:11:03.186 --> 00:11:05.089\nthat's learning, which is a lot harder,\n\n00:11:05.113 --> 00:11:07.098\nbecause we need to do error minimization,\n\n00:11:07.122 --> 00:11:08.809\nusing a lot of training examples.\n\n00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:12.020\nAnd about a year ago,\nAlex Mordvintsev, on our team,\n\n00:11:12.044 --> 00:11:15.594\ndecided to experiment\nwith what happens if we try solving for x,\n\n00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.655\ngiven a known w and a known y.\n\n00:11:18.082 --> 00:11:19.233\nIn other words,\n\n00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:20.609\nyou know that it's a bird,\n\n00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:23.936\nand you already have your neural network\nthat you've trained on birds,\n\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.304\nbut what is the picture of a bird?\n\n00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:32.016\nIt turns out that by using exactly\nthe same error-minimization procedure,\n\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.470\none can do that with the network\ntrained to recognize birds,\n\n00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:38.882\nand the result turns out to be ...\n\n00:11:42.358 --> 00:11:43.663\na picture of birds.\n\n00:11:44.772 --> 00:11:48.509\nSo this is a picture of birds\ngenerated entirely by a neural network\n\n00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.359\nthat was trained to recognize birds,\n\n00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:53.921\njust by solving for x\nrather than solving for y,\n\n00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:55.233\nand doing that iteratively.\n\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.537\nHere's another fun example.\n\n00:11:57.561 --> 00:12:00.998\nThis was a work made\nby Mike Tyka in our group,\n\n00:12:01.022 --> 00:12:03.330\nwhich he calls \"Animal Parade.\"\n\n00:12:03.354 --> 00:12:06.230\nIt reminds me a little bit\nof William Kentridge's artworks,\n\n00:12:06.254 --> 00:12:08.743\nin which he makes sketches, rubs them out,\n\n00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:10.227\nmakes sketches, rubs them out,\n\n00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:11.649\nand creates a movie this way.\n\n00:12:11.673 --> 00:12:12.824\nIn this case,\n\n00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:16.125\nwhat Mike is doing is varying y\nover the space of different animals,\n\n00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:18.531\nin a network designed\nto recognize and distinguish\n\n00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:20.365\ndifferent animals from each other.\n\n00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:24.140\nAnd you get this strange, Escher-like\nmorph from one animal to another.\n\n00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:30.793\nHere he and Alex together\nhave tried reducing\n\n00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:33.576\nthe y's to a space of only two dimensions,\n\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.038\nthereby making a map\nout of the space of all things\n\n00:12:37.062 --> 00:12:38.781\nrecognized by this network.\n\n00:12:38.805 --> 00:12:40.828\nDoing this kind of synthesis\n\n00:12:40.852 --> 00:12:43.234\nor generation of imagery\nover that entire surface,\n\n00:12:43.258 --> 00:12:46.104\nvarying y over the surface,\nyou make a kind of map --\n\n00:12:46.128 --> 00:12:49.269\na visual map of all the things\nthe network knows how to recognize.\n\n00:12:49.293 --> 00:12:52.158\nThe animals are all here;\n\"armadillo\" is right in that spot.\n\n00:12:52.877 --> 00:12:55.356\nYou can do this with other kinds\nof networks as well.\n\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.254\nThis is a network designed\nto recognize faces,\n\n00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.278\nto distinguish one face from another.\n\n00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:03.551\nAnd here, we're putting\nin a y that says, \"me,\"\n\n00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.150\nmy own face parameters.\n\n00:13:05.174 --> 00:13:06.880\nAnd when this thing solves for x,\n\n00:13:06.904 --> 00:13:09.522\nit generates this rather crazy,\n\n00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:13.974\nkind of cubist, surreal,\npsychedelic picture of me\n\n00:13:13.998 --> 00:13:15.804\nfrom multiple points of view at once.\n\n00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:18.562\nThe reason it looks like\nmultiple points of view at once\n\n00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:22.273\nis because that network is designed\nto get rid of the ambiguity\n\n00:13:22.297 --> 00:13:24.773\nof a face being in one pose\nor another pose,\n\n00:13:24.797 --> 00:13:28.173\nbeing looked at with one kind of lighting,\nanother kind of lighting.\n\n00:13:28.197 --> 00:13:30.282\nSo when you do\nthis sort of reconstruction,\n\n00:13:30.306 --> 00:13:32.610\nif you don't use some sort of guide image\n\n00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:33.845\nor guide statistics,\n\n00:13:33.869 --> 00:13:37.634\nthen you'll get a sort of confusion\nof different points of view,\n\n00:13:37.658 --> 00:13:39.026\nbecause it's ambiguous.\n\n00:13:39.744 --> 00:13:43.967\nThis is what happens if Alex uses\nhis own face as a guide image\n\n00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:47.312\nduring that optimization process\nto reconstruct my own face.\n\n00:13:48.242 --> 00:13:50.570\nSo you can see it's not perfect.\n\n00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:52.468\nThere's still quite a lot of work to do\n\n00:13:52.492 --> 00:13:54.945\non how we optimize\nthat optimization process.\n\n00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:57.796\nBut you start to get something\nmore like a coherent face,\n\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.834\nrendered using my own face as a guide.\n\n00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.351\nYou don't have to start\nwith a blank canvas\n\n00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.531\nor with white noise.\n\n00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:05.859\nWhen you're solving for x,\n\n00:14:05.883 --> 00:14:09.772\nyou can begin with an x,\nthat is itself already some other image.\n\n00:14:09.796 --> 00:14:12.352\nThat's what this little demonstration is.\n\n00:14:12.376 --> 00:14:16.498\nThis is a network\nthat is designed to categorize\n\n00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.641\nall sorts of different objects --\nman-made structures, animals ...\n\n00:14:19.665 --> 00:14:22.258\nHere we're starting\nwith just a picture of clouds,\n\n00:14:22.282 --> 00:14:23.953\nand as we optimize,\n\n00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:28.463\nbasically, this network is figuring out\nwhat it sees in the clouds.\n\n00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:31.209\nAnd the more time\nyou spend looking at this,\n\n00:14:31.233 --> 00:14:33.986\nthe more things you also\nwill see in the clouds.\n\n00:14:34.962 --> 00:14:38.337\nYou could also use the face network\nto hallucinate into this,\n\n00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:40.173\nand you get some pretty crazy stuff.\n\n00:14:40.197 --> 00:14:41.347\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:45.103\nOr, Mike has done some other experiments\n\n00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:49.032\nin which he takes that cloud image,\n\n00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:52.563\nhallucinates, zooms, hallucinates,\nzooms hallucinates, zooms.\n\n00:14:52.587 --> 00:14:53.738\nAnd in this way,\n\n00:14:53.762 --> 00:14:57.437\nyou can get a sort of fugue state\nof the network, I suppose,\n\n00:14:57.461 --> 00:15:01.141\nor a sort of free association,\n\n00:15:01.165 --> 00:15:03.392\nin which the network\nis eating its own tail.\n\n00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:06.837\nSo every image is now the basis for,\n\n00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:08.282\n\"What do I think I see next?\n\n00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:11.109\nWhat do I think I see next?\nWhat do I think I see next?\"\n\n00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:14.381\nI showed this for the first time in public\n\n00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:19.842\nto a group at a lecture in Seattle\ncalled \"Higher Education\" --\n\n00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:22.303\nthis was right after\nmarijuana was legalized.\n\n00:15:22.327 --> 00:15:24.742\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:26.585 --> 00:15:28.689\nSo I'd like to finish up quickly\n\n00:15:28.713 --> 00:15:32.968\nby just noting that this technology\nis not constrained.\n\n00:15:32.992 --> 00:15:36.657\nI've shown you purely visual examples\nbecause they're really fun to look at.\n\n00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:39.132\nIt's not a purely visual technology.\n\n00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:41.149\nOur artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin,\n\n00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:44.844\nhas done experiments involving\na camera that takes a picture,\n\n00:15:44.868 --> 00:15:49.102\nand then a computer in his backpack\nwrites a poem using neural networks,\n\n00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:51.070\nbased on the contents of the image.\n\n00:15:51.094 --> 00:15:54.041\nAnd that poetry neural network\nhas been trained\n\n00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:56.299\non a large corpus of 20th-century poetry.\n\n00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.822\nAnd the poetry is, you know,\n\n00:15:57.846 --> 00:15:59.760\nI think, kind of not bad, actually.\n\n00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:01.168\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:01.192 --> 00:16:02.351\nIn closing,\n\n00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:04.507\nI think that per Michelangelo,\n\n00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:05.765\nI think he was right;\n\n00:16:05.789 --> 00:16:09.225\nperception and creativity\nare very intimately connected.\n\n00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:12.203\nWhat we've just seen are neural networks\n\n00:16:12.227 --> 00:16:14.530\nthat are entirely trained to discriminate,\n\n00:16:14.554 --> 00:16:16.796\nor to recognize different\nthings in the world,\n\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.981\nable to be run in reverse, to generate.\n\n00:16:20.005 --> 00:16:21.788\nOne of the things that suggests to me\n\n00:16:21.812 --> 00:16:24.210\nis not only that\nMichelangelo really did see\n\n00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.686\nthe sculpture in the blocks of stone,\n\n00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.348\nbut that any creature,\nany being, any alien\n\n00:16:30.372 --> 00:16:34.029\nthat is able to do\nperceptual acts of that sort\n\n00:16:34.053 --> 00:16:35.428\nis also able to create\n\n00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:38.676\nbecause it's exactly the same\nmachinery that's used in both cases.\n\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.232\nAlso, I think that perception\nand creativity are by no means\n\n00:16:43.256 --> 00:16:44.466\nuniquely human.\n\n00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.198\nWe start to have computer models\nthat can do exactly these sorts of things.\n\n00:16:48.222 --> 00:16:51.550\nAnd that ought to be unsurprising;\nthe brain is computational.\n\n00:16:51.574 --> 00:16:53.231\nAnd finally,\n\n00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:57.923\ncomputing began as an exercise\nin designing intelligent machinery.\n\n00:16:57.947 --> 00:17:00.409\nIt was very much modeled after the idea\n\n00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:03.446\nof how could we make machines intelligent.\n\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.632\nAnd we finally are starting to fulfill now\n\n00:17:05.656 --> 00:17:08.062\nsome of the promises\nof those early pioneers,\n\n00:17:08.086 --> 00:17:09.799\nof Turing and von Neumann\n\n00:17:09.823 --> 00:17:12.088\nand McCulloch and Pitts.\n\n00:17:12.112 --> 00:17:16.210\nAnd I think that computing\nis not just about accounting\n\n00:17:16.234 --> 00:17:18.381\nor playing Candy Crush or something.\n\n00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:20.983\nFrom the beginning,\nwe modeled them after our minds.\n\n00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:24.276\nAnd they give us both the ability\nto understand our own minds better\n\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.829\nand to extend them.\n\n00:17:26.585 --> 00:17:27.752\nThank you very much.\n\n00:17:27.776 --> 00:17:33.715\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why you think you're right -- even if you're wrong", "duration": "697", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/julia_galef_why_you_think_you_re_right_even_if_you_re_wrong", "transcript": "So I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're a soldier in the heat of battle. Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you're a Zulu warrior. Regardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant. Your adrenaline is elevated, and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes, reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy.So now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the scout. The scout's job is not to attack or defend. The scout's job is to understand. The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles. And the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river. But above all, the scout wants to know what's really there, as accurately as possible. And in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential. But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset \u2014 a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives. What I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment, making accurate predictions, making good decisions, is mostly about which mindset you're in.To illustrate these mindsets in action, I'm going to take you back to 19th-century France, where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history. It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff. It was torn up in a wastepaper basket, but when they pieced it back together, they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany.So they launched a big investigation, and their suspicions quickly converged on this man, Alfred Dreyfus. He had a sterling record, no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell. But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army, and unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-Semitic. They compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match, even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity, but never mind that. They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment, looking for any signs of espionage. They went through his files, and they didn't find anything. This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty, but sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it.Next, they went and looked through his personal history for any incriminating details. They talked to his teachers, they found that he had studied foreign languages in school, which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments later in life. His teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory, which was highly suspicious, right? You know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things.So the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty. Afterwards, they took him out into this public square and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two. This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus. And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devil's Island, which is this barren rock off the coast of South America. So there he went, and there he spent his days alone, writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence. But for the most part, France considered the matter closed.One thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were intentionally framing him. But historians don't think that's what happened. As far as we can tell, the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong. Which makes you wonder: What does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man?Well, this is a case of what scientists call \"motivated reasoning.\" It's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, our desires and fears, shape the way we interpret information. Some information, some ideas, feel like our allies. We want them to win. We want to defend them. And other information or ideas are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down. So this is why I call motivated reasoning, \"soldier mindset.\"Probably most of you have never persecuted a French-Jewish officer for high treason, I assume, but maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul, for example, you're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong. But if he judges that the other team committed a foul \u2014 awesome! That's a good call, let's not examine it too closely. Or, maybe you've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy, like capital punishment. And, as researchers have demonstrated, if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it's not effective, then you're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed. But if it shows that capital punishment works, it's a good study. And vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment, same thing.Our judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously, by which side we want to win. And this is ubiquitous. This shapes how we think about our health, our relationships, how we decide how to vote, what we consider fair or ethical. What's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset, is how unconscious it is. We can think we're being objective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man.However, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over. This is Colonel Picquart. He's another high-ranking officer in the French Army, and like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty. Also like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic. But at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect: \"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?\" What happened was, he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued, even after Dreyfus was in prison. And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo, much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting. So he brought these discoveries to his superiors, but to his dismay, they either didn't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings, like, \"Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting, and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left. But Dreyfus is still guilty.\" Eventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated. But it took him 10 years, and for part of that time, he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army.A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with. But personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic actually makes his actions more admirable, because he had the same prejudices, the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers, but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that.So to me, Picquart is a poster child for what I call \"scout mindset.\" It's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose, but just to see what's really there as honestly and accurately as you can, even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant. This mindset is what I'm personally passionate about. And I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset. Why are some people, sometimes at least, able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can?And the answer is emotional. So, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism, scout mindset is, too. It's just rooted in different emotions. For example, scouts are curious. They're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle. They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations. Scouts also have different values. They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak. And above all, scouts are grounded, which means their self-worth as a person isn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic. So they can believe that capital punishment works. If studies come out showing that it doesn't, they can say, \"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid.\"This cluster of traits is what researchers have found \u2014 and I've also found anecdotally \u2014 predicts good judgment. And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that they're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know. In fact, they don't correlate very much with IQ at all. They're about how you feel. There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He's the author of \"The Little Prince.\" He said, \"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\"In other words, I claim, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valuable. But what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset. We need to change the way we feel. We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something. We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs.So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most yearn for? Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs? Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2537, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:15.427\nSo I'd like you to imagine for a moment\n\n00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.831\nthat you're a soldier\nin the heat of battle.\n\n00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:22.219\nMaybe you're a Roman foot soldier\nor a medieval archer\n\n00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:24.123\nor maybe you're a Zulu warrior.\n\n00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:28.401\nRegardless of your time and place,\nthere are some things that are constant.\n\n00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:30.319\nYour adrenaline is elevated,\n\n00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:35.152\nand your actions are stemming\nfrom these deeply ingrained reflexes,\n\n00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:39.532\nreflexes rooted in a need\nto protect yourself and your side\n\n00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:41.245\nand to defeat the enemy.\n\n00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:46.321\nSo now, I'd like you to imagine\nplaying a very different role,\n\n00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:47.946\nthat of the scout.\n\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.359\nThe scout's job is not\nto attack or defend.\n\n00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.778\nThe scout's job is to understand.\n\n00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:56.252\nThe scout is the one going out,\n\n00:00:56.276 --> 00:01:00.339\nmapping the terrain,\nidentifying potential obstacles.\n\n00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:03.939\nAnd the scout may hope to learn\nthat, say, there's a bridge\n\n00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:06.297\nin a convenient location across a river.\n\n00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:09.368\nBut above all, the scout\nwants to know what's really there,\n\n00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:10.985\nas accurately as possible.\n\n00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:17.199\nAnd in a real, actual army, both\nthe soldier and the scout are essential.\n\n00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:22.533\nBut you can also think of each\nof these roles as a mindset --\n\n00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:26.184\na metaphor for how all of us\nprocess information and ideas\n\n00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:27.675\nin our daily lives.\n\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.980\nWhat I'm going to argue today\nis that having good judgment,\n\n00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.218\nmaking accurate predictions,\nmaking good decisions,\n\n00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:38.000\nis mostly about which mindset you're in.\n\n00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:41.545\nTo illustrate these mindsets in action,\n\n00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.053\nI'm going to take you back\nto 19th-century France,\n\n00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:48.060\nwhere this innocuous-looking\npiece of paper\n\n00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:51.122\nlaunched one of the biggest\npolitical scandals in history.\n\n00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:56.073\nIt was discovered in 1894\nby officers in the French general staff.\n\n00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:59.266\nIt was torn up in a wastepaper basket,\n\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.215\nbut when they pieced it back together,\n\n00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.271\nthey discovered\nthat someone in their ranks\n\n00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:05.658\nhad been selling\nmilitary secrets to Germany.\n\n00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.777\nSo they launched a big investigation,\n\n00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:12.667\nand their suspicions\nquickly converged on this man,\n\n00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:14.023\nAlfred Dreyfus.\n\n00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:16.143\nHe had a sterling record,\n\n00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:19.687\nno past history of wrongdoing,\nno motive as far as they could tell.\n\n00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.418\nBut Dreyfus was the only\nJewish officer at that rank in the army,\n\n00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:29.617\nand unfortunately at this time,\nthe French Army was highly anti-Semitic.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.863\nThey compared Dreyfus's handwriting\nto that on the memo\n\n00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:34.824\nand concluded that it was a match,\n\n00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:37.890\neven though outside\nprofessional handwriting experts\n\n00:02:37.914 --> 00:02:40.064\nwere much less confident\nin the similarity,\n\n00:02:40.088 --> 00:02:41.478\nbut never mind that.\n\n00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:43.542\nThey went and searched\nDreyfus's apartment,\n\n00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:45.322\nlooking for any signs of espionage.\n\n00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:48.306\nThey went through his files,\nand they didn't find anything.\n\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.464\nThis just convinced them more\nthat Dreyfus was not only guilty,\n\n00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:54.781\nbut sneaky as well, because clearly\nhe had hidden all of the evidence\n\n00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:56.654\nbefore they had managed to get to it.\n\n00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.862\nNext, they went and looked\nthrough his personal history\n\n00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:02.187\nfor any incriminating details.\n\n00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:03.813\nThey talked to his teachers,\n\n00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:06.622\nthey found that he had studied\nforeign languages in school,\n\n00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:10.699\nwhich clearly showed a desire\nto conspire with foreign governments\n\n00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:11.906\nlater in life.\n\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.941\nHis teachers also said that Dreyfus\nwas known for having a good memory,\n\n00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.077\nwhich was highly suspicious, right?\n\n00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:23.441\nYou know, because a spy\nhas to remember a lot of things.\n\n00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:28.057\nSo the case went to trial,\nand Dreyfus was found guilty.\n\n00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:32.094\nAfterwards, they took him out\ninto this public square\n\n00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:35.842\nand ritualistically tore\nhis insignia from his uniform\n\n00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:37.771\nand broke his sword in two.\n\n00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:39.810\nThis was called\nthe Degradation of Dreyfus.\n\n00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:43.335\nAnd they sentenced him\nto life imprisonment\n\n00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.099\non the aptly named Devil's Island,\n\n00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:48.947\nwhich is this barren rock\noff the coast of South America.\n\n00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:53.264\nSo there he went,\nand there he spent his days alone,\n\n00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:55.792\nwriting letters and letters\nto the French government\n\n00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:59.124\nbegging them to reopen his case\nso they could discover his innocence.\n\n00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:02.505\nBut for the most part,\nFrance considered the matter closed.\n\n00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:07.552\nOne thing that's really interesting\nto me about the Dreyfus Affair\n\n00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:11.354\nis this question of why the officers\nwere so convinced\n\n00:04:11.378 --> 00:04:13.099\nthat Dreyfus was guilty.\n\n00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:16.361\nI mean, you might even assume\nthat they were setting him up,\n\n00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:18.353\nthat they were intentionally framing him.\n\n00:04:18.377 --> 00:04:20.644\nBut historians don't think\nthat's what happened.\n\n00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:21.827\nAs far as we can tell,\n\n00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:26.088\nthe officers genuinely believed\nthat the case against Dreyfus was strong.\n\n00:04:26.112 -->

information.\n\n00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:51.712\nSome information, some ideas,\nfeel like our allies.\n\n00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:54.378\nWe want them to win.\nWe want to defend them.\n\n00:04:54.402 --> 00:04:56.933\nAnd other information\nor ideas are the enemy,\n\n00:04:56.957 --> 00:04:58.525\nand we want to shoot them down.\n\n00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:03.073\nSo this is why I call\nmotivated reasoning, \"soldier mindset.\"\n\n00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:06.951\nProbably most of you have never persecuted\n\n00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:09.256\na French-Jewish officer for high treason,\n\n00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.753\nI assume,\n\n00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:15.636\nbut maybe you've followed sports\nor politics, so you might have noticed\n\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.782\nthat when the referee

00:06:23.998\nand still wind up ruining the life\nof an innocent man.\n\n00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:27.849\nHowever, fortunately for Dreyfus,\nhis story is not over.\n\n00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:29.241\nThis is Colonel Picquart.\n\n00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:31.809\nHe's another high-ranking officer\nin the French Army,\n\n00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:34.462\nand like most people,\nhe assumed Dreyfus was guilty.\n\n00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:39.276\nAlso like most people in the army,\nhe was at least casually anti-Semitic.\n\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.665\nBut at a certain point,\nPicquart began to suspect:\n\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.035\n\"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?\"\n\n00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.584\nWhat happened was,\nhe had discovered evidence\n\n00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:51.085\nthat the spying for Germany had continued,\n\n00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:53.084\neven after Dreyfus was in prison.\n\n00:06:53.474 --> 00:06:56.770\nAnd he had also discovered\nthat another officer in the army\n\n00:06:56.794 --> 00:06:59.367\nhad handwriting that perfectly\nmatched the memo,\n\n00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.752\nmuch closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.\n\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.181\nSo he brought these discoveries\nto his superiors,\n\n00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:09.652\nbut to his dismay,\nthey either didn't care\n\n00:07:09.676 --> 00:07:13.264\nor came up with elaborate rationalizations\nto explain his findings,\n\n00:07:13.288 --> 00:07:18.661\nlike, \"Well, all you've really shown,\nPicquart, is that there's another spy\n\n00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:21.058\nwho learned how to mimic\nDreyfus's handwriting,\n\n00:07:21.082 --> 00:07:24.622\nand he picked up the torch of spying\nafter Dreyfus left.\n\n00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:26.756\nBut Dreyfus is still guilty.\"\n\n00:07:27.812 --> 00:07:30.837\nEventually, Picquart managed\nto get Dreyfus exonerated.\n\n00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:32.389\nBut it took him 10 years,\n\n00:07:32.413 --> 00:07:34.944\nand for part of that time,\nhe himself was in prison\n\n00:07:34.968 --> 00:07:37.266\nfor the crime of disloyalty to the army.\n\n00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:44.449\nA lot of people feel like Picquart\ncan't really be the hero of this story\n\n00:07:44.473 --> 00:07:48.702\nbecause he was an anti-Semite\nand that's bad, which I agree with.\n\n00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:53.932\nBut personally, for me,\nthe fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic\n\n00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:56.541\nactually makes his actions more admirable,\n\n00:07:56.565 --> 00:07:59.681\nbecause he had the same prejudices,\nthe same reasons to be biased\n\n00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:01.490\nas his fellow officers,\n\n00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:06.149\nbut his motivation to find the truth\nand uphold it trumped all of that.\n\n00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:08.255\nSo to me,\n\n00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:12.085\nPicquart is a poster child\nfor what I call \"scout mindset.\"\n\n00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:16.632\nIt's the drive not to make\none idea win or another lose,\n\n00:08:16.656 --> 00:08:18.580\nbut just to see what's really there\n\n00:08:18.604 --> 00:08:21.079\nas honestly and accurately as you can,\n\n00:08:21.103 --> 00:08:24.383\neven if it's not pretty\nor convenient or pleasant.\n\n00:08:25.402 --> 00:08:28.648\nThis mindset is what\nI'm personally passionate about.\n\n00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:33.801\nAnd I've spent the last few years\nexamining and trying to figure out\n\n00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:35.808\nwhat causes scout mindset.\n\n00:08:35.832 --> 00:08:38.980\nWhy are some people, sometimes at least,\n\n00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:42.792\nable to cut through their own prejudices\nand biases and motivations\n\n00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:45.111\nand just try to see the facts\nand the evidence\n\n00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:46.608\nas objectively as they can?\n\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.571\nAnd the answer is emotional.\n\n00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:54.844\nSo, just as soldier mindset\nis rooted in emotions\n\n00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.856\nlike defensiveness or tribalism,\n\n00:08:58.573 --> 00:08:59.939\nscout mindset is, too.\n\n00:08:59.963 --> 00:09:01.949\nIt's just rooted in different emotions.\n\n00:09:01.973 --> 00:09:05.392\nFor example, scouts are curious.\n\n00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:08.962\nThey're more likely to say\nthey feel pleasure\n\n00:09:08.986 --> 00:09:10.646\nwhen they learn new information\n\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.981\nor an itch to solve a puzzle.\n\n00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:16.671\nThey're more likely to feel intrigued\nwhen they encounter something\n\n00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:18.791\nthat contradicts their expectations.\n\n00:09:19.164 --> 00:09:21.141\nScouts also have different values.\n\n00:09:21.165 --> 00:09:24.237\nThey're more likely to say\nthey think it's virtuous\n\n00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:25.750\nto test your own beliefs,\n\n00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.480\nand they're less likely to say\nthat someone who changes his mind\n\n00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:30.766\nseems weak.\n\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.675\nAnd above all, scouts are grounded,\n\n00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:36.604\nwhich means their self-worth as a person\n\n00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:42.094\nisn't tied to how right or wrong\nthey are about any particular topic.\n\n00:09:42.118 --> 00:09:45.372\nSo they can believe\nthat capital punishment works.\n\n00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:48.209\nIf studies come out showing\nthat it doesn't, they can say,\n\n00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:52.142\n\"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong.\nDoesn't mean I'm bad or stupid.\"\n\n00:09:53.912 --> 00:09:58.238\nThis cluster of traits\nis what researchers have found --\n\n00:09:58.262 --> 00:09:59.968\nand I've also found anecdotally --\n\n00:09:59.992 --> 00:10:01.823\npredicts good judgment.\n\n00:10:02.344 --> 00:10:05.627\nAnd the key takeaway I want\nto leave you with about those traits\n\n00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:09.288\nis that they're primarily\nnot about how smart you are\n\n00:10:09.312 --> 00:10:11.310\nor about how much you know.\n\n00:10:11.334 --> 00:10:14.140\nIn fact, they don't correlate\nvery much with IQ at all.\n\n00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:16.246\nThey're about how you feel.\n\n00:10:16.807 --> 00:10:20.830\nThere's a quote that I keep\ncoming back to, by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\n00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:22.795\nHe's the author of \"The Little Prince.\"\n\n00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:25.588\nHe said, \"If you want to build a ship,\n\n00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:30.813\ndon't drum up your men\nto collect wood and give orders\n\n00:10:30.837 --> 00:10:32.257\nand distribute the work.\n\n00:10:32.627 --> 00:10:37.194\nInstead, teach them to yearn\nfor the vast and endless sea.\"\n\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.356\nIn other words, I claim,\n\n00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:43.968\nif we really want to improve\nour judgment as individuals\n\n00:10:43.992 --> 00:10:45.435\nand as societies,\n\n00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:48.968\nwhat we need most\nis not more instruction in logic\n\n00:10:48.992 --> 00:10:52.540\nor rhetoric or probability or economics,\n\n00:10:52.564 --> 00:10:54.647\neven though those things\nare quite valuable.\n\n00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:57.975\nBut what we most need\nto use those principles well\n\n00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:59.417\nis scout mindset.\n\n00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:01.321\nWe need to change the way we feel.\n\n00:11:01.717 --> 00:11:05.527\nWe need to learn how to feel proud\ninstead of ashamed\n\n00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:08.189\nwhen we notice we might\nhave been wrong about something.\n\n00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:11.341\nWe need to learn how to feel intrigued\ninstead of defensive\n\n00:11:11.365 --> 00:11:15.608\nwhen we encounter some information\nthat contradicts our beliefs.\n\n00:11:16.513 --> 00:11:19.373\nSo the question I want\nto leave you with is:\n\n00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:21.925\nWhat do you most yearn for?\n\n00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:25.356\nDo you yearn to defend your own beliefs?\n\n00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:29.680\nOr do you yearn to see the world\nas clearly as you possibly can?\n\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.461\nThank you.\n\n00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:36.482\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Clues to prehistoric times, found in blind cavefish", "duration": "289", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/prosanta_chakrabarty_clues_to_prehistoric_times_found_in_blind_cavefish", "transcript": "Ichthyology, the study of fishes. It looks like a big, boring word, but it's actually quite exciting, because ichthyology is the only \"ology\" with \"YOLO\" in it.(Laughter)Now, to the cool kids in the audience, you already know, YOLO stands for \"you only live once,\" and because I only have one life, I'm going to spend it doing what I always dreamt of doing: seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species. And that's what I get to do.Now, in recent years, I really focused on caves for finding new species. And it turns out, there's lots of new cavefish species out there. You just have to know where to look, and to maybe be a little thin.(Laughter)Now, cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology. They can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little holes, and they can tell me about the evolution of sight, by being blind.Now, fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours. All vertebrates do, and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark, cold, cave environment, over many, many generations, they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here. Now, each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way, and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us, and that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species.So this is a new species we described, from southern Indiana. We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri, the Hoosier cavefish.(Laughter)Its closest relatives are cavefishes in Kentucky, in the Mammoth Cave system. And they start to diverge when the Ohio River split them a few million years ago. And in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness. There's this gene called rhodopsin that's super-critical for sight. We have it, and these species have it too, except one species has lost all function in that gene, and the other one maintains it. So this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision, and at the very roots of how we can see.But the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time, maybe no more so than in this species here. This is a new species we described from Madagascar that we named Typhleotris mararybe. That means \"big sickness\" in Malagasy, for how sick we got trying to collect this species. Now, believe it or not, swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life, but YOLO.(Laughter)Now, I love this species despite the fact that it tried to kill us, and that's because this species in Madagascar, its closest relatives are 6,000 kilometers away, cavefishes in Australia. Now, there's no way a three-inch-long freshwater cavefish can swim across the Indian Ocean, so what we found when we compared the DNA of these species is that they've been separated for more than 100 million years, or about the time that the southern continents were last together. So in fact, these species didn't move at all. It's the continents that moved them. And so they give us, through their DNA, this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events.Now, this species here is so new I'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet, but I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico, and it's probably already extinct. It's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby. Unfortunately for cavefishes, their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water.Now, we actually don't know this species' closest relative, yet. It doesn't appear to be anything else in Mexico, so maybe it's something in Cuba, or Florida, or India. But whatever it is, it might tell us something new about the geology of the Caribbean, or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness. But I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too.And I'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet and the biology of how we see.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2536, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.950 -->

"transcript": "At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour. We visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators, with inmates in our state and local prisons. We've gone to immigration detention centers. We've met a lot of people. And we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers, giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time.Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline. What would it look like if we intervened, with rehabilitation as a core value \u2014 with love and compassion as core values? We would have a society that is safer, healthier and worthy of raising our children in.I want to introduce you to James Cavitt. James served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison and is being released in 18 months. Now James, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he's done. He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet. He committed a crime; he's paying his debt, and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again.Now James, like millions of people behind bars, is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don't define who we are, that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration, we can all heal together.I'd like to introduce you to James right now, and he's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word.James Cavitt: Thanks, John. TED, welcome to San Quentin. The talent is abundant behind prison walls. Future software engineers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, musicians and artists. This piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time.This piece is entitled, \"Where I Live.\"I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go. Surrounded by tall, concrete walls, steel bars, where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow.I live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong. Imagine that.Better yet, imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong. Maybe then we would all be singin' \"Redemption Song.\"I live in a world that has been called \"hell on Earth\" by those trapped inside. But I've come to the stark realization that prison \u2014 it really is what you make it. You see, in spite of the harshness of my reality, there is a silver lining. I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time. And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile, and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom.And just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom. Many of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons. We walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin': freedom!Don't you get it? We're all serving time; we're just in different places. As for me, I choose to be free from the prisons I've created. The key: forgiveness. Action's my witness. If we want freedom, then we gotta think different. Because freedom ... it isn't a place. It's a mind setting.Thank you.(Applause)(Piano)John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I. Sold I to the merchant ships. Minutes after they took I from the bottomless pit.My hands were made strong by the hand of the almighty. We forward in this generation triumphantly.Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom? 'Cause all I ever had \u2014 redemption songs. Redemption songs.Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery. None but ourselves can free our minds. Have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time.How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look? Some say it's just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book.Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom? 'Cause all I ever had \u2014 redemption songs.

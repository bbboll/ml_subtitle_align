I feel like a fish out of water, or maybe an owl out of the air.(Laughter)I was preaching in San Jose some time ago, and my friend Mark Kvamme, who helped introduce me to this conference, brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me, or I with them. And I was so stimulated. And had such \u2014 it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference, and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard can answer that, because he made that decision.But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia, coming down. I was to address a conference at a hotel. And on that elevator a man said, \"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.\" And another man looked in my direction and said, \"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us.\" And this man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds, and he said, \"My, what an anticlimax!\"(Laughter)I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a \u2014 is an anticlimax, after all these tremendous talks that you've heard, and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them. But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago, and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him. And there was a drunk man on there, and he got up out of his seat two or three times, and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do. And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by, and everybody was upset with him. And finally, John Belk said, \"Do you know who's sitting here?\" And the man said, \"No, who?\" He said, \"It's Billy Graham, the preacher.\" He said, \"You don't say!\" And he turned to me, and he said, \"Put her there!\" He said, \"Your sermons have certainly helped me.\"(Laughter)And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people.(Laughter)I know that as you have been peering into the future, and as we've heard some of it here tonight, I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. But I won't, because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year, and I know that my time is brief. I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs, and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here, because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that, and some other problems that I won't talk about.(Laughter)But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution. We've had others. And there's one that I want to talk about. In one generation, the nation of the people of Israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the Near East. A man by the name of David came to the throne, and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. He was a man of tremendous leadership. He had the favor of God with him. He was a brilliant poet, philosopher, writer, soldier \u2014 with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today.But about two centuries before David, the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron, and, slowly, that skill spread. But they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it, or to have any. But David changed all of that, and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel. And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron, and which archaeologists have found, that in present-day Palestine, there are evidences of that generation. Now, instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones, Israel now had iron plows, and sickles, and hoes and military weapons. And in the course of one generation, Israel was completely changed. The introduction of iron, in some ways, had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve.There were many problems still left. And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them, and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that. How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention? The first one that David saw was human evil. Where does it come from? How do we solve it? Over again and again in the Psalms, which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world, David describes the evils of the human race. And yet he says, \"He restores my soul.\" Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are? On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology, as this conference vividly demonstrates. We've seen under the sea, three miles down, or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future.But on the other hand, something is wrong. Our battleships, our soldiers, are on a frontier now, almost ready to go to war with Iraq. Now, what causes this? Why do we have these wars in every generation, and in every part of the world? And revolutions? We can't get along with other people, even in our own families. We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can't break. Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world, bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death. Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle. I would like to see Oracle take up that, or some other technological geniuses work on this. How do we change man, so that he doesn't lie and cheat, and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever?The Bible says the problem is within us, within our hearts and our souls. Our problem is that we are separated from our Creator, which we call God, and we need to have our souls restored, something only God can do. Jesus said, \"For out of the heart come evil thoughts: murders, sexual immorality, theft, false testimonies, slander.\" The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man, but he said, \"It's in our hearts that the evil lies, and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out.\" Albert Einstein \u2014 I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton, and I met Mr. Einstein. He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said nobody was qualified to give him one.(Laughter)But he made this statement. He said, \"It's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man.\" And many of you, I'm sure, have thought about that and puzzled over it. You've seen people take beneficial technological advances, such as the Internet we've heard about tonight, and twist them into something corrupting. You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology, horribly used. The problem is not technology. The problem is the person or persons using it. King David said that he knew the depths of his own soul. He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery. Yet King David sought God's forgiveness, and said, \"You can restore my soul.\"You see, the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. We are a soul. And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. That's the part of us that yearns for God, or something more than we find in technology. Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life, and which seeks for something beyond this life. It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God. I find [that] young people all over the world are searching for something. They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities, and I have many questions and answer periods, and whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard, or Oxford \u2014 I've spoken at all of those universities. I'm going to Harvard in about three or four \u2014 no, it's about two months from now \u2014 to give a lecture. And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there. And it'll be on these questions: where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? What's life all about? Why am I here?Even if you have no religious belief, there are times when you wonder that there's something else. Thomas Edison also said, \"When you see everything that happens in the world of science, and in the working of the universe, you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge.\" I remember once, I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner. I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well. And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists, and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect. And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well, and I said, \"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. What shall I talk to her about?\" And he surprised me with the answer. He said, \"Talk to her about religion and philosophy. That's what she's really interested in.\" I was a little bit surprised, but that evening that's what we talked about, and it was a stimulating conversation. And afterward, she said, \"You know, I'm an atheist, but I know that there's something up there higher than we are.\"The second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering. Writing the oldest book in the world was Job, and he said, \"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.\" Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. But I'm \u2014 in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age. I admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years. My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this \u2014 to be here. I haven't given a talk in nearly four months. And when you speak as much as I do, three or four times a day, you get rusty. That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes. Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere, I'm ad-libbing. I'm not reading. I never read an address. I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture. I talk ad lib. But tonight, I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget, which I do sometimes, I've got something I can turn to.But even here among us, most \u2014 in the most advanced society in the world, we have poverty. We have families that self-destruct, friends that betray us. Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us. I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry. Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question that we haven't answered. Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God. He said, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\" The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation. Most people live as if they're never going to die. Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality. We see people on our screens. Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our \u2014 many young people think she's still alive. They don't know that she's dead. Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is. The old stars, they come to life. And they're \u2014 they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. But death is inevitable.I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress, last year. And we were meeting in that room, the statue room. About 300 of them were there. And I said, \"There's one thing that we have in common in this room, all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat, or whoever.\" I said, \"We're all going to die. And we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us.\" And it's often difficult for young people to understand that. It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die. As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote, he said, there's every activity under heaven. There's a time to be born, and there's a time to die. I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people, whom you would know. I've talked to them. I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death.And yet, a few years earlier, death never crossed their mind. I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor. She said he never thought of God, never talked about God, didn't believe in God. He was an atheist. But she said, as he came to die, he sat up on the side of the bed one day, and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain. And he said, for the first time in his life he'd thought about the inevitable, and about God. Was there a God? A few years ago, a university student asked me, \"What is the greatest surprise in your life?\" And I said, \"The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life. It passes so fast.\" But it does not need to have to be that way. Wernher von Braun, in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote: \"science and religion are not antagonists. On the contrary, they're sisters.\" He put it on a personal basis. I knew Dr. von Braun very well. And he said, \"Speaking for myself, I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator.\" He also said, \"In our search to know God, I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration. The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind.\"I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France, and in different parts of the world \u2014 105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in. And I was invited one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer, who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany, since the war. And he once \u2014 and he said to me, he said, \"Young man.\" He said, \"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?\" And I said, \"Sir, I do.\" He said, \"So do I.\" He said, \"When I leave office, I'm going to spend my time writing a book on why Jesus Christ rose again, and why it's so important to believe that.\" In one of his plays, Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying, who says to those gathered around his bed, \"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying.\" How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France. Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization. He was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics, even as a teenager. He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory, and a creator of the first model of a computer. And of course, you are all familiar with the computer language named for him. Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil, suffering and death. He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering: that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science, the arts and human enterprise, yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy and have \u2014 and self-hatreds. Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion. On November 23, 1654, Pascal had a profound religious experience. He wrote in his journal these words: \"I submit myself, absolutely, to Jesus Christ, my redeemer.\"A French historian said, two centuries later, \"Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ.\" Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony, but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven, and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven. He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason. It was he who penned the well-known words, \"The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of.\"Equally well known is Pascal's Wager. Essentially, he said this: \"if you bet on God, and open yourself to his love, you lose nothing, even if you're wrong. But if instead you bet that there is no God, then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.\" For Pascal, scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God. The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind. He was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39. King David lived to be 70, a long time in his era. Yet he too had to face death, and he wrote these words: \"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.\"This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil, suffering and death. It can be yours, as well, as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future. When I was 17 years of age, I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina. I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school. And there were 20 of them that I had \u2014 that I was responsible for, and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies. I didn't make good grades in high school. I didn't make them in college, until something happened in my heart.One day, I was faced face-to-face with Christ. He said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\" Can you imagine that? \"I am the truth. I'm the embodiment of all truth.\" He was a liar. Or he was insane. Or he was what he claimed to be. Which was he? I had to make that decision. I couldn't prove it. I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it. But by faith I said, I believe him, and he came into my heart and changed my life. And now I'm ready, when I hear that call, to go into the presence of God. Thank you, and God bless all of you.(Applause)Thank you for the privilege. It was great.Richard Wurman: You did it.

dramatic change\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat made them a great power in the Near East.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nA man by the name of David\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\ncame to the throne,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand King David became one of the great leaders\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nof his generation.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nHe was a man of tremendous leadership.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHe had the favor of God with him.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nHe was a brilliant poet,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nphilosopher, writer, soldier --\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwith strategies in battle and conflict\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat people study even today.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nBut about two centuries before David,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthe Hittites\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nhad discovered the secret\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nof smelting and processing of iron,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand, slowly, that skill spread.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut they wouldn't allow the Israelis\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nto look into it, or to have any.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut David changed all of that,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand he introduced the Iron Age\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nto Israel.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand which archaeologists have found,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nthat in present-day Palestine,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthere are evidences of that generation.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nNow, instead of crude tools\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nmade of sticks and stones,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIsrael now had iron plows,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand sickles, and hoes\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand military weapons.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd in the course of one generation,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIsrael was completely changed.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe introduction of iron, in some ways,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nhad an impact\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\na little bit like the microchip\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nhas had on our generation.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nDavid found\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat there were many problems that technology could not solve.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThere were many problems still left.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nHow do we solve these three problems\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat I'd like to mention?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nThe first one that David saw\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwas human evil.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhere does it come from?\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHow do we solve it?\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nOver again and again\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nin the Psalms,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhich Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nDavid describes the evils of the human race.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd yet he says,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\n\"He restores my soul.\"\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nHave you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nOn one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nas this conference vividly demonstrates.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nWe've seen under the sea,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthree miles down,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nor galaxies hundreds of billions of years\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nout in the future.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nBut on the other hand,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nsomething is wrong.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nOur battleships,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nour soldiers,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nare on a frontier now,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nalmost ready to go to war\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwith Iraq.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nNow, what causes this?\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nWhy do we have these wars in every generation,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand in every part of the world?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd revolutions?\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWe can't get along with other people,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\neven in our own families.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWe find ourselves in the paralyzing grip\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nof self-destructive habits we can't break.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nRacism and injustice and violence sweep our world,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nEven the most sophisticated among us\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nseem powerless to break this cycle.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI would like to see Oracle\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\ntake up that,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nor\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nsome other\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\ntechnological geniuses work on this.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nHow do we change man,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nso that he doesn't lie and cheat,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand our newspapers are not filled with stories\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nof fraud in business or labor\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nor athletics or wherever?\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe Bible says the problem is within us,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwithin our hearts and our souls.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nOur problem is that we are separated\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nfrom our Creator,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhich we call God,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand we need to have our souls restored,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nsomething only God can do.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nJesus said, \"For out of the heart\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\ncome evil thoughts:\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nmurders, sexual immorality,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ntheft, false testimonies,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nslander.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThe British philosopher Bertrand Russell\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nwas not a religious man,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbut he said, \"It's in our hearts that the evil lies,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand it's from our hearts\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthat it must be plucked out.\"\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAlbert Einstein --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nI was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand I met\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nMr. Einstein.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nHe didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nnobody was qualified to give him one.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut he made this statement.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe said, \"It's easier to denature plutonium\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nthan to denature the evil spirit of man.\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd many of you, I'm sure,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nhave thought about that\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand puzzled over it.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nYou've seen people\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\ntake beneficial technological advances,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nsuch as the Internet we've heard about tonight,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand twist them into something corrupting.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nYou've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthat bring down whole systems.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThe Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nhorribly used.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThe problem is not technology.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThe problem is the person or persons using it.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nKing David said\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat he knew the depths of his own soul.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nHe couldn't free himself from personal problems\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand personal evils\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthat included murder and adultery.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYet King David sought God's forgiveness,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand said, \"You can restore my soul.\"\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nYou see, the Bible teaches\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat we're more than a body and a mind.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nWe are a soul.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd there's something inside of us\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat is beyond our understanding.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThat's the part of us that yearns\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nfor God, or something more\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nthan we find in technology.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nYour soul is that part of you that\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nyearns for meaning in life,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand which seeks for something beyond this life.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIt's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI find [that] young people all over the world\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nare searching for something.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThey don't know what it is.

extraordinary heights\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nin science, the arts and human enterprise,\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nyet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:51.958\nand have -- and self-hatreds.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nPascal saw us as a remarkable mixture\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nof genius and self-delusion.\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nOn November 23,\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:01.958\n1654,\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nPascal had a profound religious experience.\n\n00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nHe wrote in his journal these words:\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.958\n\"I submit myself,\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nabsolutely,\n\n00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nto Jesus Christ, my redeemer.\"\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nA French historian said,\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.958\ntwo centuries later,\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.958\n\"Seldom has so mighty an intellect\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:28.958\nsubmitted with such humility\n\n00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:31.958\nto the authority of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nPascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:38.958\ncould bring us back into harmony,\n\n00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nbut he believed\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nthat his own sins and failures could be forgiven,\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nand that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.\n\n00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:52.958\nHe experienced it in a way that went beyond\n\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.958\nscientific observation and reason.\n\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:57.958\nIt was he who penned the well-known words,\n\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:22:59.958\n\"The heart has its reasons,\n\n00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:03.958\nwhich reason knows not of.\"\n\n00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:06.958\nEqually well known is Pascal's Wager.\n\n00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nEssentially, he said this: \"if you bet on God,\n\n00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.958\nand open yourself to his love,\n\n00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:15.958\nyou lose nothing, even if you're wrong.\n\n00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:18.958\nBut if instead you bet that there is no God,\n\n00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:22.958\nthen you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.\"\n\n00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:26.958\nFor Pascal, scientific knowledge\n\n00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:29.958\npaled beside the knowledge of God.\n\n00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:32.958\nThe knowledge of God was far beyond\n\n00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:35.958\nanything that ever crossed his mind.\n\n00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nHe was ready to face him\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.958\nwhen he died at the age of 39.\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:42.958\nKing David lived to be 70,\n\n00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.958\na long time in his era.\n\n00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:48.958\nYet he too had to face death,\n\n00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:50.958\nand he wrote these words:\n\n00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:54.958\n\"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\n\n00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nI will fear no evil,\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.958\nfor you are with me.\"\n\n00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:01.958\nThis was David's answer to three dilemmas\n\n00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:04.958\nof evil, suffering and death.\n\n00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:07.958\nIt can be yours, as well,\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:10.958\nas you seek the living God\n\n00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:12.958\nand allow him to fill your life\n\n00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:15.958\nand give you hope for the future.\n\n00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:19.958\nWhen I was 17 years of age,\n\n00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:24.958\nI was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:27.958\nI milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening\n\n00:24:27.958 --> 00:24:29.958\nwhen I came home from school.\n\n00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:31.958\nAnd there were 20 of them that I had --\n\n00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:34.958\nthat I was responsible for,\n\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.958\nand I worked on the farm\n\n00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.958\nand tried to keep up with my studies.\n\n00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:43.958\nI didn't make good grades in high school.\n\n00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.958\nI didn't make them in college, until\n\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.958\nsomething happened in my heart.\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:51.958\nOne day, I was faced face-to-face\n\n00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.958\nwith Christ.\n\n00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:57.958\nHe said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\"\n\n00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:01.958\nCan you imagine that? \"I am the truth.\n\n00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nI'm the embodiment of all truth.\"\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:06.958\nHe was a liar.\n\n00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:10.958\nOr he was insane.\n\n00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:13.958\nOr he was what he claimed to be.\n\n00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:15.958\nWhich was he?\n\n00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.958\nI had to make that decision.\n\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.958\nI couldn't prove it.\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:21.958\nI couldn't take it to a laboratory\n\n00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:23.958\nand experiment with it.\n\n00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:26.958\nBut by faith I said, I believe him,\n\n00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:30.958\nand he came into my heart\n\n00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:32.958\nand changed my life.\n\n00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:35.958\nAnd now I'm ready,\n\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:37.958\nwhen I hear that call,\n\n00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:40.958\nto go into the presence of God.\n\n00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.958\nThank you, and God bless all of you.\n\n00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:52.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:55.958\nThank you for the privilege. It was great.\n\n00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:57.958\nRichard Wurman: You did it.\n\n00:25:57.958 --> 00:25:58.958\nThanks.\n\n00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:14.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My year of living biblically", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/a_j_jacobs_year_of_living_biblically", "transcript": "I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. And I like to immerse myself in my topics. I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. And I see my life as a series of experiments.So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called \"My Outsourced Life,\" where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me. So, they answered my emails. They answered my phone. They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories. It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. It was a wonderful experience.More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called \u2014 about radical honesty. And this is a movement where \u2014 this is started by a psychologist in Virginia, who says that you should never, ever lie, except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions. And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. So, I decided I would try this for a month. This was the worst month of my life. (Laughter) I do not recommend this at all. To give you a sense of the experience, the article was called, \"I Think You're Fat.\" (Laughter) So, that was hard.My most recent book \u2014 my previous book was called \"The Know-It-All,\" and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is \u2014 well, I don't want to ruin the ending. (Laughter) It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it. But I love that one, because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything. You can just Google it. So, I wasted some time there.I love those experiments, but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible, \"The Year of Living Biblically.\" And I undertook this for two reasons. The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. (Laughter) So, not very. But I've become increasingly interested in religion. I do think it's the defining issue of our time, or one of the main ones. And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism, and people who say they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls, as high as 45 or 50 percent of America. So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally? I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally, without picking and choosing.The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. I had Christian bibles. I had Jewish bibles. A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, \"The Lord is all that,\" as opposed to what I knew it as, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\"Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find. And this was a very long list \u2014 over 700 rules. And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of \u2014 The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. So I wanted to follow those. And actually, I take my projects very seriously, because I had twins during my year, so I definitely take my projects seriously.But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. There is the law in Leviticus, \"You cannot shave the corners of your beard.\" I didn't know where my corners were, so I decided to let the whole thing grow, and this is what I looked like by the end. As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security. (Laughter) My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. So, certainly the challenge was there.The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, \"Sounds strange, but I'll try it.\" You only know if you try it. I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts. The Bible says that if two men are in a fight, and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man, then her hand shall be cut off. So, I wanted to follow that rule. (Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip. (Laughter) So \u2014 oh, there's another shot of my beard.I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging. And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying \u2014 you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress, because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person. So I had always thought, you know, \"You change your mind, and you change your behavior,\" but it's often the other way around. You change your behavior, and you change your mind. So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause. So, it really was cognitive psychology \u2014 you know, cognitive dissonance \u2014 that I was experiencing. The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology, very primitive cognitive psychology. In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier, which, as we know, is actually true.The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America. And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. (Laughter) But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it. So, I was able to stone one adulterer. It happened \u2014 I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner. I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. And this man came up to me and he said, \"Why are you dressed like that?\" And I explained my project, and he said, \"Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?\" And I said, \"Well, that would be great!\" (Laughter) And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks, hoping for just this interaction \u2014 and, you know, they were pebbles \u2014 but he grabbed them out of my hand. He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry. He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could \u2014 eye for an eye \u2014 I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues. How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places, and yet so incredibly wise in others? How should we view the Bible? Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? How was the Bible written? And actually, since this is a tech crowd, I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. And it's sort of evolved. It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally. This became very, very clear, early on. Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person, and stoning adulterers, or \u2014 here's another example. Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. (Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.But this one is \u2014 the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around.So, you know, I met with creationists. I went to the creationists' museum. And these are the ultimate literalists. And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all. I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous. They really did a fantastic job. If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. So, whatever you think of creationism \u2014 and I think it's crazy \u2014 they did a great job. (Laughter)Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. And this one was a big lesson because I was praying, giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic. But I was saying thanks all the time, every day, and I started to change my perspective. And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day, that I didn't even notice, that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. So, this is actually a key to happiness for me, is to just remember when I came over here, the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. It's a remarkable thing.Third, that thou shall have reverence. This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic, and by the end of the year, I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love. And I'm trying to start it as a movement. So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred. The Sabbath can be sacred. This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life. So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.Thou shall not stereotype. This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. I wanted it to be about religion in America. So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish. I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness. (Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, \"I gotta go.\" (Laughter) Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. Bless you, bless you.But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance, evangelical Christianity, and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians, and they focus on the red words in the Bible, which are the ones that Jesus spoke. That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. They have a pamphlet that says, \"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,\" and you open it up, and there's nothing in it. So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts, helping poor people. So, this was very inspiring to me. I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree with much of what they say.Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational. This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. And the thing is, if they're not harmful, they're not to be completely dismissed. Because I learned that \u2014 I was thinking, I was doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals, separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people \"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?\" And they said, \"We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning.\" And I would say, \"But that's crazy.\" And they would say, \"Well, what about you? You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'\" So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational. So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful \u2014 but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed.And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. And I failed miserably. Because you can't. You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. The key is to pick and choose the right parts. There's the phrase called cafeteria religion, and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way, and they'll say, \"Oh, it's just cafeteria religion. You're just picking and choosing.\" But my argument is, \"What's wrong with cafeterias?\" I've had some great meals at cafeterias. I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well. So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. There's me reading the Bible. That's how I hailed taxicabs. (Laughter) Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day. So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.", "id": 301, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nAnd I like to immerse myself in my topics.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd I see my life as a series of experiments.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nSo, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI wrote an article called \"My Outsourced Life,\"\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwhere I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nto live my life for me.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nSo, they answered my emails.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nThey answered my phone.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThey argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nIt was the best month of my life,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbecause I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nIt was a wonderful experience.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nMore recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nabout radical honesty.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd this is a movement where --\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthis is started by a psychologist in Virginia,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwho says that you should never, ever lie,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nexcept maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd, more than that, whatever is on your brain\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nshould come out of your mouth.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nSo, I decided I would try this for a month.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nThis was the worst month of my life.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nI do not recommend this at all.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nTo give you a sense of the experience,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthe article was called, \"I Think You're Fat.\"\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo, that was hard.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nMy most recent book -- my previous book was called \"The Know-It-All,\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nfrom A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nor more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nall the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nIt's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nBut I love that one,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbecause that was an experiment about how much information\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\none human brain could absorb.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAlthough, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nYou can just Google it.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, I wasted some time there.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nI love those experiments,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbut I think that the most profound\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand life-changing experiment that I've done\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nis my most recent experiment, where I spent a year\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\ntrying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\n\"The Year of Living Biblically.\"\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd I undertook this for two reasons.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe first was that I grew up with no religion at all.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAs I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthe Olive Garden is Italian.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nSo, not very.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nBut I've become increasingly interested in religion.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI do think it's the defining issue of our time,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nor one of the main ones.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nSo, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThe second reason I undertook this is because\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nreligious fundamentalism, and people who say\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthey take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nas high as 45 or 50 percent of America.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nSo I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI decided to take it to its logical conclusion\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand take everything in the Bible literally,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwithout picking and choosing.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThe first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nI had Christian bibles.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nI had Jewish bibles.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nA friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhere the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, \"The Lord is all that,\"\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nas opposed to what I knew it as, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\"\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nThen I went down and I read several versions,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand I wrote down every single law that I could find.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThe Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo I wanted to follow those.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd actually, I take my projects very seriously,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nbecause I had twins during my year,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nso I definitely take my projects seriously.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBut I also wanted to follow the hundreds\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nof arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThere is the law in Leviticus,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\n\"You cannot shave the corners of your beard.\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI didn't know where my corners were,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nso I decided to let the whole thing grow,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand this is what I looked like by the end.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAs you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nMy wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nSo, certainly the challenge was there.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nso I thought, \"Sounds strange, but I'll try it.\"\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nYou only know if you try it.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nI got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThe Bible says that if two men are in a fight,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthen her hand shall be cut off.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo, I wanted to follow that rule.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThat one I followed by default,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nby not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nlooking like she had a strong grip.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nI will say it was an amazing year\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nbecause it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThe first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nYou know, I could spend a year not killing,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nbut spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nyou know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nso this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbecause I couldn't believe how much\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nmy behavior changed my thoughts.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThis was one of the huge lessons of the year,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nis that I almost pretended to be a better person,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand I became a little bit of a better person.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo I had always thought, you know, \"You change your mind,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand you change your behavior,\" but it's often the other way around.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nYou change your behavior, and you change your mind.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nyou visit sick people in the hospital,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand you will become more compassionate.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nYou donate money to a cause,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand you become emotionally involved in that cause.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo, it really was cognitive psychology --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nyou know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThe Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nvery primitive cognitive psychology.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIn the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nwhich, as we know, is actually true.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThe second type of rule that was difficult to obey\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwas the rules that will get you into a little trouble\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nin twenty-first-century America.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nBut it's a big part of the Bible,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nso I figured I had to address it.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo, I was able to stone one adulterer.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nIt happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nso sandals and sort of a white robe,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nyou know, because again, the outer affects the inner.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd this man came up to me and he said,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n\"Why are you dressed like that?\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd I explained my project,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand he said, \"Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?\"\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, that would be great!\"\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat I had been carrying around for weeks,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nhoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbut he grabbed them out of my hand.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHe was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nHe grabbed them out of my hand\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\neye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSo that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nto talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHow can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand yet so incredibly wise in others?\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nHow should we view the Bible?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nShould we view it, you know, as original intent,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nlike a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nHow was the Bible written?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd actually, since this is a tech crowd,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nI talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nof the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nover hundreds of years.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd it's sort of evolved.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nIt's not a book that was written and came down from on high.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nSo I thought I would end by telling you\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\njust a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthat I learned from my year.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThis became very, very clear, early on.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nBecause if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWell, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nIt's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBut this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nduring certain times of the month, and more than that,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nyou cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd my wife thought this was very offensive,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nso she sat in every seat in our apartment,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand I had to spend much of the year standing\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nuntil I bought my own seat and carried it around.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, you know, I met with creationists.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nI went to the creationists' museum.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd these are the ultimate literalists.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nAnd it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nIt's just that their faith is so strong\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nin this literal interpretation of the Bible\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthat they distort all the data to fit their model.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThey really did a fantastic job.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nIf you're ever in Kentucky,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthere's, you can see a movie of the flood,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand they have sprinklers in the ceiling\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthey did a great job.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnother lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd this one was a big lesson because I was praying,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\ngiving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nBut I was saying thanks all the time, every day,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand I started to change my perspective.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd I started to realize the hundreds of little things\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat go right every day, that I didn't even notice,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat I took for granted, as opposed to focusing\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\non the three or four that went wrong.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSo, this is actually a key to happiness for me,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nis to just remember when I came over here,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthe car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt's a remarkable thing.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThird, that thou shall have reverence.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThis one was unexpected because I started the year\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nas an agnostic, and by the end of the year,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nI became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd I'm trying to start it as a movement.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo, if anyone wants to join,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nthe basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nthere's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand that our rituals can be sacred.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe Sabbath can be sacred.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThis was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nbecause I am a workaholic, so having this one day\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwhere you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThou shall not stereotype.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThis one happened because\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI spent a lot of time with various religious communities\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthroughout America because I wanted it to be more\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthan about my journey.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI wanted it to be about religion in America.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nI'm very proud because\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nI think I'm the only person in America\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nto out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nAfter three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nhe's like, \"I gotta go.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nOh, thank you very much.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThank you. Bless you, bless you.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBut it was interesting\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nbecause I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nevangelical Christianity, and I found that\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nit's such a wide and varied movement\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat it is difficult to make generalizations about it.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThere's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand they focus on the red words in the Bible,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nwhich are the ones that Jesus spoke.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThat's how they printed them in the old Bibles.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nAnd their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThey have a pamphlet that says,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n\"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,\"\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand you open it up, and there's nothing in it.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nSo, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nhelping poor people.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo, this was very inspiring to me.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nI recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nThey're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwith much of what they say.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAlso, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nThis one was very unexpected because, you know,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nI grew up with the scientific worldview,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand I was shocked learning how much of my life\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nis governed by irrational forces.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAnd the thing is, if they're not harmful,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthey're not to be completely dismissed.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBecause I learned that -- I was thinking, I was\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\ndoing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nseparating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\n\"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?\"\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd they said, \"We don't know,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nbut it's just rituals that give us meaning.\"\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I would say, \"But that's crazy.\"\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd they would say, \"Well, what about you?\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nYou blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nIf a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nblowing out the fire on top of a cake\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nversus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nwould the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbut that guy's crazy?'\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nSo no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nSo the key is to choose the right rituals,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nthe ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nare not to be dismissed.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd this one I learned because\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI tried to follow everything in the Bible.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd I failed miserably.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nBecause you can't.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nYou have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nis going to be picking and choosing.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThe key is to pick and choose the right parts.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThere's the phrase called cafeteria religion,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nand the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand they'll say, \"Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nYou're just picking and choosing.\"\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nBut my argument is, \"What's wrong with cafeterias?\"\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nI've had some great meals at cafeterias.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nI've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nSo, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nabout tolerance, about loving your neighbor,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nas opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nor intolerance, or violence,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nwhich are very much in the Bible as well.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo if we are to find any meaning in this book,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthen we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nAnd I thought I'd end with just a couple more.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nThere's me reading the Bible.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nThat's how I hailed taxicabs.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nSeriously, and it worked. And yes,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nthat was actually a rented sheep,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nso I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nSo, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak."}, {"title": "Brain magic", "duration": "1189", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/keith_barry_does_brain_magic", "transcript": "Brain magic. What's brain magic all about? Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects. So unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words, linguistic deception, non-verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody. I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all. OK, clap them together, once. OK, reverse your hands. Now, follow my actions exactly. Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that? OK, swap them around, put your right hand up. Cross your hands over, so your right hand goes over, interlace your fingers like this, then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb \u2014 that's very important. Yours is the other way around, so swap it around. Excellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me. All right. Tap them together once. OK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds, you would all be able to do this.(Laughter)(Laughter ends)Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.(Laughter)Now, I remember when I was about 15,(Laughter)I read a copy of Life magazine, which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters \u2014 there's still people trying to do it \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch. And she was completely blind. She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed, face down, on a hard surface. Now, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical. How could somebody read using their fingertips? You know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind \u2014 a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms, where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. How could somebody read using their fingertips?Now earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV, I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight. So, let's take a look.(Video) Man: There we go. I'm going to guide you into the car.Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter)Man: You're OK, keep on going.KT: How are you?Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here. I'm going to take you to a secret location, OK? Kathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold.KT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK?KT: Yes.KB: No way to see through it? KT: No.KB: I'll take it off. Do you want to take the rest off? Take it off, you're OK. We'll stop for a second.KT: I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see.KB: You're fine, take it off. You're OK. You're safe. Have you ever heard of second sight?KT: No.KB: Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else's eyes. And I'm going to try that right now.KT: God.KB: Are you ready? Where is it? There's no way \u2014KT: (Beep)KT: Oh, my God!KB: Don't say anything, I'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see.KT: There's a wall, there's a wall.KB: Look at the road, look at the road.KT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God!KB: Now, anything coming at all? KT: No.KB: Sure there's not?KT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road. I'm looking at the road, all the time. I'm not taking my eyes off the road.(Beep)(Beep)(Beep)KT: Oh, my God!KB: Where are we? Where are we? We're going uphill, are we going uphill?KT: Look at the road \u2014 (Beep) Still got that goddamn blindfold on.KB: What?KT: How are you doing this?KB: Just don't break my concentration.We're OK, though? KT: Yes. That's so weird. We're nearly there. Oh, my God!Oh, my God!KB: And I've stopped.KT: That is weird. You're like a freak-ass of nature. That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life!(Applause)KB: Thank you. By the way, two days ago, we were going to film this down there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car, and we got a camera man in the back, but halfway through the drive, he told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter, stuck to his leg. So, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it.So, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes? That's the question. Now, most people here would automatically say no. OK, but I want you to realize some facts. I couldn't see through the blindfold. The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way. The girl, I'd never met before, all right. So, I want you to just think about it for a moment. A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened, all right. But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception, the solutions you come up with will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark.This is because magic is all about directing attention. If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand, then I don't look at it. But if I wanted you to look at my right hand, then I look at it, too. You see, it's very simple, once you know how, but very complicated in other ways.I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now. I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up? And let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick? Do you mind? Yes, at the end. OK, give them a round of applause as they come up. You might want to use the stairs, there.(Applause)It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you. You don't know what will happen, right? Would you mind just standing over here for a moment?Your name is? Nicole: Nicole.KB: Nicole, and?(Telephone ringing)KB: Actually, here's the thing, answer it, answer it, answer it.(Laughter)Is it a girl? Man: They've already gone.KB: OK, swap over positions. Can you stand over here? This will make it easier. Pity, I would have told them it was the ace of spades. OK, a little bit closer.(Laughter)OK, a little bit closer, come over \u2014 they look really nervous up here. Do you believe in witchcraft?Nicole: No.KB: Voodoo? Nicole: No.KB: Things that go bump in the night? Nicole: No.KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK. I want you to just stand exactly like this for me, pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind. OK, now, I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you, because we'll try a voodoo experiment. I want you to be aware of the sensations, but don't say anything until I ask you, and don't open your eyes until I ask you. From this point onwards, close your eyes, do not say anything, do not open them, be aware of the sensations.Yes or no, did you feel anything?Nicole: Yes.KB: You did feel that? What did you feel?Nicole: A touch on my back.KB: How many times did you feel it?Nicole: Twice.KB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm out in front of you. Extend your left arm, OK. OK, keep it there. Be aware of the sensations, don't say anything, don't open your eyes, OK.Did you feel anything, there?Nicole: Yes. KB: What did you feel?Nicole: Three \u2014KB: Like a tickling sensation? Nicole: Yes.KB: Can you show us where? OK, excellent. Open your eyes. I never touched you. I just touched his back, and I just touched his arm. A voodoo experiment.(Laughter)Yeah, I walk around nightclubs all night like this.(Laughter)You just take a seat over here for a second. I'm going to use you again, in a moment. Can you take a seat right over here, if you don't mind.Sit right here. Man: OK.KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK. Now, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK, just take a deep breath in through your nose, letting it out through your mouth, and relax. Allow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one. Close your eyes right now. OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines. And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.I want you to hold it there just for a moment, and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness, and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. That's it, all the way down, all the way down. and further, and further. Excellent. I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop. OK, now, allow it to stay there.OK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK, and I want you to be aware of the pressure. Just be aware of the pressure. And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release, but only when you feel the pressure release. Do you understand? Just answer yes or no.Man: Yes.KB: Hold it right there. And only when you feel the pressure go back, allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop, but only when you feel the pressure.(Laughter)OK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.Excellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting. Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed. Can you stand up? Just stand, stage forward. I want you to point directly at his forehead. OK. Imagine a connection between you and him. Only when you want the pressure to be released, make an upward gesture, like this, but only when you want it to be released. You can wait as long as you want, but only when you want the pressure released. OK, let's try it again. OK, now, imagine the connection, OK. Point directly at his forehead. Only when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again.OK, it worked that time, excellent. And hold it there, both of you. Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture. You can wait as long as you want. You did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK.Now, I want you to be aware that in a moment, when I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again. It's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened. Most people ask you, \"What the hell just happened up here?\" But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized, you will forget everything that happened. On five, four, three, two, one \u2014 open your eyes, wide awake. Give them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats.(Applause)OK, you can go back.(Applause)I once saw a film called \"The Gods Are Crazy.\" Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah. Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane, and it landed on the ground, and it didn't break? Now, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid. It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle. Do you want to try it? Good job. She's not taking any chances.(Laughter)You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. For some magicians or mentalists, sometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not. Sometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not. It depends on how much energy you have that day, so on and so forth.We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now. Come right over here, next to me. Excellent. Now, have a look at the Coke bottle. Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle. And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful. Even though it's solid, I'm standing away. I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb. Excellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK. I want you to examine the shard of glass. Careful, it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment. Now, hold it out here.I want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago. I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship, from that guy, being imparted into the broken piece of glass, which will represent him, OK. But I want you to take this very seriously. Stare at the glass, ignore everybody right here. In a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK, and when you feel that sensation, I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle. Think of that guy, that ba \u2014 that guy.(Laughter)I'm trying to be good here. OK, and when you feel the sensation \u2014 it might take a while \u2014 drop it into the glass. OK, drop it in.Now, imagine all that negative energy in there. Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass. And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side.(Burst)(Laughter)That was a lot of negative energy, built up in there.(Laughter)(Applause)I also want you to look at me and think of his name. OK, think of how many letters in the title of his name. There's five letters in the title. You didn't react to that, so it's four letters. Think of one of the letters in the title. There's a K in his name, there is a K. I knew that because my name starts with a K also, but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M. Tell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him.Was that his name? Nicole: Mm-hmm.KB: OK, give her a round of applause.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)(Applause ends)I've got one more thing to share with you right now. Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment? And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing.Chris Anderson: Oh, OK.KB: I was going to use you, but I decided I might want to come back another year.(Laughter)CA: Well, to reward him for saying \"eureka,\" and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us \u2014 Steve Jurvetson.KB: OK, Steve, come on up here.(Applause)CA: You knew!KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here. Excellent. Now, Steve \u2014 oh, you can check underneath. Go ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there. They insist that because I was a magician, put a nice, black tablecloth on. There you are, OK.(Laughter)I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve. One, two, three and four. Now, they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it. I want you to examine it, and make sure it's solid. Happy?Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes.KB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going to stand in front of the table, When I stand in front of the table, I want you to put the cups on the plinths, in any order you want, and then mix them all up, so nobody has any idea where the spike is, all right?SJ: No one in the audience?KB: Yes, and just to help you out, I'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing. I'll also look away. So, go ahead and mix them up, now. OK, and tell me when you're done.(Laughter)(Laughter)KB: You done? SJ: Almost.KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden. Oh, we've got one here, we've got one here.(Applause)So, all right, we'll leave them like that.(Laughter)I'm going to have the last laugh, though.(Laughter)Now, Steve, you know where the spike is, but nobody else, does? Correct? But I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair. They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny. No, stay around, OK. Now, Steve, look back. Now you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either. Now, is there any way to see through this blindfold?SJ: Put this on?KB: No, just, is there any way to see through it? No?SJ: No, I can't see through it. KB: Excellent. Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold. Don't stack them up, OK. Give them an extra mix up. Don't move the cups, I don't want anybody to see where the spike is, but give the plinths an extra mix up, and then line them up. I'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up. No messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up. My hand is at risk here.(Laughter)Tell me when you're done. SJ: Done.KB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand. Your right hand. Tell me when I'm over a cup.SJ: You're over a cup. KB: I'm over a cup, right now?SJ: Mm-hmm.KB: Now, Steve, do you think it's here? Yes or no?SJ: Oh!(Laughter)KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh.(Laughter)SJ: I don't think it's there. KB: No? Good decision.(Laughter)(Applause)(Applause ends)Now, if I go this way, is there another cup over here?SJ: Can we do the left hand?KB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not.(Laughter)KB: If I go this way, is there another cup?SJ: Yes. KB: Tell me when to stop.SJ: OK. KB: There?SJ: Yes, there's one.KB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no? This is your decision, not mine.(Laughter)SJ: I'm going to say no. KB: Good decision.(Laughter)OK, give me both hands. Now, put them on both cups. Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand?SJ: Neither.KB: Neither, oh, OK. But if you were to guess.(Laughter)SJ: Under my right hand. KB: Under your right hand? Now, remember, you made all the decisions all along. Psychologists, figure this out.(SJ gasps)Have a look.SJ: Oh!(Applause)KB: Thank you.(Applause ends) If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on, I'll be outside. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 310, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nBrain magic.

And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today, which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic. The editor of Discover told us 10 of them; I'm going to give you the eleventh.So they came to me, CNN, and they said, \"Professor Seligman \u2014 would you tell us about the state of psychology today? We'd like to interview you about that.\" And I said, \"Great.\" And she said, \"But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite.\" I said, \"Well, how many words do I get?\" And she said, \"Well, one.\"(Laughter)And the cameras rolled, and she said, \"Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Good.\"(Laughter)\"Cut! Cut. That won't do. We'd really better give you a longer sound bite.\" \"How many words do I get this time?\" \"Well, you get two.\"(Laughter)\"Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Not good.\"(Laughter)\"Look, Doctor Seligman, we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium. We'd better give you a real sound bite. This time you can have three words. Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Not good enough.\" That's what I'm going to be talking about.I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good, and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough. And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology, about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.So, why was psychology good? Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model. Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did, they'd move away from me, because, quite rightly, they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony. And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.What was good about psychology \u2014 about the $30 billion investment NIMH made, about working in the disease model, about what you mean by psychology \u2014 is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable; it was entirely smoke and mirrors. And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.And the other thing that happened is that a science developed, a science of mental illness. We found out we could take fuzzy concepts like depression, alcoholism, and measure them with rigor; that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses; that we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses. We could look across time at the same people \u2014 people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia \u2014 and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are, and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments. And then we were able to test them rigorously, in random-assignment, placebo-controlled designs, throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.The conclusion of that is, psychology and psychiatry of the last 60 years can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable. And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it. But what was not good, the consequences of that, were three things.The first was moral; that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers; that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you. And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives. We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive. And \"genius,\" \"high-talent,\" became a dirty word. No one works on that.And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier \u2014 positive interventions.So that was not good. And so that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call, \"positive psychology,\" which has three aims. The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness. It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage. It should be interested in the best things in life. And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living. It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness. And any of you, for free, can go to that website \u2014[www.authentichappiness.org]and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness. You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning, for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people? We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities: a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio, how they're defined, how to diagnose them, what builds them and what gets in their way. We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity, as a cause of happiness.I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people, and I've asked the question: How do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you? And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people. How do they differ from the rest of us? It turns out there's one way, very surprising \u2014 they're not more religious, they're not in better shape, they don't have more money, they're not better looking, they don't have more good events and fewer bad events. The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social. They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.(Laughter)They don't spend time alone. Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends.But watch out here \u2014 this is merely correlational data, not causal, and it's about happiness in the first, \"Hollywood\" sense, I'm going to talk about, happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer. And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment. We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries, from the Buddha to Tony Robbins. About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy. And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them, and we actually carry out random-assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies. That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier? In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is, can psychology actually make people happier? And to ask that question \u2014 \"happy\" is not a word I use very much \u2014 we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about \"happy.\" And I believe there are three different \u2014 I call them \"different\" because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other \u2014 three different happy lives. The first happy life is the pleasant life. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it. The second is a life of engagement: a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure; time stops for you. That's what Aristotle was talking about. And third, the meaningful life. I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.The first life is the pleasant life, and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills \u2014 savoring, mindfulness \u2014 that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space. But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology, and why it doesn't end here.The first drawback is, it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable. So the different tricks that Matthieu and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it. Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly, indeed. It's all like French vanilla ice cream: the first taste is 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone. And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.And this leads to the second life. I have to tell you about my friend Len, to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion, more than building pleasure. In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30, Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work. By the time he was 20, he was an options trader. By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company. Second, in play, he's a national champion bridge player. But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure. And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.(Laughter)Len is an introvert. American women said to Len, when he dated them, \"You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost.\" And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him. But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma. It turned out that \u2014 Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football, and played bridge. Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.The question is: Is Len unhappy? And I want to say, not. Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity, I think Len is one of the happiest people I know. He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness, and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow. When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning, time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell. When the first card is played till 10 days later, when the tournament is over, time stops for Len.And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way: pleasure has raw feel \u2014 you know it's happening; it's thought and feeling. But what Mike told you yesterday \u2014 during flow ... you can't feel anything. You're one with the music. Time stops. You have intense concentration. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. And we think there's a recipe for it, and it's knowing what your highest strengths are \u2014 again, there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are \u2014 and then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can. Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's. Hated the job. She's working her way through college. Her highest strength was social intelligence. So she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day. Now, obviously she failed. But what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible. What you get out of that is not smiley-ness. You don't look like Debbie Reynolds. You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption.So, that's the second path. The first path, positive emotion; the second path is eudaemonian flow; and the third path is meaning. This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally. And meaning, in this view, consists of \u2014 very parallel to eudaemonia \u2014 it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives \u2014 the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life \u2014 people are now hard at work on the question: Are there things that lastingly change those lives? And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. It's being done in a rigorous manner. It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works. So we do random-assignment, placebo-controlled, long-term studies of different interventions. Just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect: when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day, and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures. And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now, if you would. Close your eyes. I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction, and who you never properly thanked. The person has to be alive. Now, OK, you can open your eyes. I hope all of you have such a person. Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why. Show up at their door, you read the testimonial \u2014 everyone weeps when this happens. And what happens is, when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.Another example is a strengths date, in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test, and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths. We find this is a strengthener of relationships. And fun versus philanthropy. It's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy. Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and contrast it. And what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set. When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts. So those are examples of positive interventions.So the next to last thing I want to say is: we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have. This is really what you're about. And that's our target variable. And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get? So we ask \u2014 and we've done this in 15 replications, involving thousands of people: To what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?And our results surprised us; they were backward of what we thought. It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction. The pursuit of meaning is the strongest. The pursuit of engagement is also very strong. Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry. Which is to say, the full life \u2014 the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three. Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.And what we're asking now is: Does the very same relationship \u2014 physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity \u2014 follow the same relationship? That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning? Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life? And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this. I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much, which was one of the remarkable things. But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way: we all know that technology, entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes. We also know that technology, entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery. And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important. I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy. And I never found that; I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero; that they were empty.And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life, the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning, are different from the skills of relieving misery. And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe. That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion. And that's typically how they've been used. But once you fractionate happiness the way I do \u2014 not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough \u2014 there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life. As Laura Lee told us, design and, I believe, entertainment and technology, can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet. And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough. If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion, meaning eudaemonia, it will be good enough. And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaemonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 312, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:15.474\nWhen I was President of the American\nPsychological Association,\n\n00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:17.124\nthey tried to media-train me.\n\n00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:22.711\nAnd an encounter I had with CNN summarizes\n\n00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:24.836\nwhat I'm going to be talking about today,\n\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.934\nwhich is the eleventh reason\nto be optimistic.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:33.134\nThe editor of Discover told us 10 of them;\n\n00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.252\nI'm going to give you the eleventh.\n\n00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:40.035\nSo they came to me, CNN,\nand they said, \"Professor Seligman --\n\n00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.721\nwould you tell us about the state\nof psychology today?\n\n00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.662\nWe'd like to interview you about that.\"\n\n00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:47.900\nAnd I said, \"Great.\"\n\n00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:52.257\nAnd she said, \"But this is CNN,\nso you only get a sound bite.\"\n\n00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:55.735\nI said, \"Well, how many words do I get?\"\n\n00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:58.142\nAnd she said, \"Well, one.\"\n\n00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.522\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.315\nAnd the cameras rolled, and she said,\n\n00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.656\n\"Professor Seligman,\nwhat is the state of psychology today?\"\n\n00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:08.345\n\"Good.\"\n\n00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.497\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.521\n\"Cut!

treatable;\n\n00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:02.765\nit was entirely smoke and mirrors.\n\n00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.252\nAnd now, 14 of the disorders\nare treatable,\n\n00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:07.180\ntwo of them actually curable.\n\n00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.414\nAnd the other thing that happened\nis that a science developed,\n\n00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:14.366\na science of mental illness.\n\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.166\nWe found out we could take fuzzy concepts\n\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.170\nlike depression, alcoholism,\n\n00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:23.785\nand measure them with rigor;\n\n00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:28.056\nthat we could create a classification\nof the mental illnesses;\n\n00:03:28.402 --> 00:03:33.083\nthat we could understand\nthe causality of the mental illnesses.\n\n00:03:33.107 --> 00:03:36.934\nWe could look across time\nat the same people --\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.935\npeople, for example, who were genetically\nvulnerable to schizophrenia --\n\n00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.171\nand ask what the contribution\nof mothering, of genetics are,\n\n00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:48.559\nand we could isolate third variables\n\n00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:50.934\nby doing experiments\non the mental illnesses.\n\n00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:54.949\nAnd best of all, we were able,\nin the last 50 years,\n\n00:03:54.973 --> 00:03:58.802\nto invent drug treatments\nand psychological treatments.\n\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.934\nAnd then we were able\nto test them rigorously,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.251\nin random-assignment,\nplacebo-controlled designs,\n\n00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.527\nthrow out the things that didn't work,\n\n00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.275\nkeep the things that actively did.\n\n00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:13.817\nThe conclusion of that is,\n\n00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.934\npsychology and psychiatry\nof the last 60 years\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:22.111\ncan actually claim that we can make\nmiserable people less miserable.\n\n00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.768\nAnd I think that's terrific.\n\n00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.178\nI'm proud of it.\n\n00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.359\nBut what was not good,\nthe consequences of that,\n\n00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.889\nwere three things.\n\n00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:36.691\nThe first was moral;\n\n00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:41.509\nthat psychologists and psychiatrists\nbecame victimologists, pathologizers;\n\n00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:44.575\nthat our view of human nature\nwas that if you were in trouble,\n\n00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:45.996\nbricks fell on you.\n\n00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.113\nAnd we forgot that people\nmade choices and decisions.\n\n00:04:49.137 --> 00:04:50.635\nWe forgot responsibility.\n\n00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.701\nThat was the first cost.\n\n00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:56.934\nThe second cost was\nthat we forgot about you people.\n\n00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.034\nWe forgot about improving normal lives.\n\n00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:06.934\nWe forgot about a mission to make\nrelatively untroubled people happier,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.738\nmore fulfilled, more productive.\n\n00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:13.068\nAnd \"genius,\" \"high-talent,\"\nbecame a dirty word.\n\n00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.021\nNo one works on that.\n\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.934\nAnd the third problem\nabout the disease model is,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.239\nin our rush to do something\nabout people in trouble,\n\n00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:25.979\nin our rush to do something\nabout repairing damage,\n\n00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:30.006\nit never occurred to us\nto develop interventions\n\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.789\nto make people happier --\npositive interventions.\n\n00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:36.134\nSo that was not good.\n\n00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:40.987\nAnd so that's what led people\nlike Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,\n\n00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:42.920\nMike Csikszentmihalyi and myself\n\n00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:45.804\nto work in something I call,\n\"positive psychology,\"\n\n00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:47.240\nwhich has three aims.\n\n00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:52.523\nThe first is that psychology\nshould be just as concerned\n\n00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:55.263\nwith human strength\nas it is with weakness.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.604\nIt should be just as concerned\nwith building strength\n\n00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.766\nas with repairing damage.\n\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.473\nIt should be interested\nin the best things in life.\n\n00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:07.371\nAnd it should be just as concerned\n\n00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:11.108\nwith making the lives\nof normal people fulfilling,\n\n00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:15.081\nand with genius,\nwith nurturing high talent.\n\n00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:20.509\nSo in the last 10 years\nand the hope for the future,\n\n00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:23.934\nwe've seen the beginnings\nof a science of positive psychology,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.133\na science of what makes life worth living.\n\n00:06:26.497 --> 00:06:31.042\nIt turns out that we can measure\ndifferent forms of happiness.\n\n00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:34.546\nAnd any of you, for free,\ncan go to that website --\n\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.961\n[www.authentichappiness.org]\n\n00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:38.464\nand take the entire panoply\nof tests of happiness.\n\n00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:42.934\nYou can ask, how do you stack\nup for positive emotion, for meaning,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.986\nfor flow, against literally tens\nof thousands of other people?\n\n00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:52.934\nWe created the opposite of the diagnostic\nmanual of the insanities:\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.179\na classification of the strengths\nand virtues that looks at the sex ratio,\n\n00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:00.409\nhow they're defined, how to diagnose them,\n\n00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:03.251\nwhat builds them\nand what gets in their way.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.397\nWe found that we could discover\nthe causation of the positive states,\n\n00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.934\nthe relationship between left\nhemispheric activity\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand right hemispheric activity,\nas a cause of happiness.\n\n00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:23.435\nI've spent my life working\non extremely miserable people,\n\n00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:24.846\nand I've asked the question:\n\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.523\nHow do extremely miserable people\ndiffer from the rest of you?\n\n00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:32.934\nAnd starting about six years ago,\nwe asked about extremely happy people.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.498\nHow do they differ from the rest of us?\n\n00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:39.005\nIt turns out there's one way,\nvery surprising --\n\n00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:41.697\nthey're not more religious,\nthey're not in better shape,\n\n00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:44.809\nthey don't have more money,\nthey're not better looking,\n\n00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:47.588\nthey don't have more good events\nand fewer bad events.\n\n00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:51.000\nThe one way in which they differ:\nthey're extremely social.\n\n00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:55.463\nThey don't sit in seminars\non Saturday morning.\n\n00:07:55.487 --> 00:07:59.442\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:01.435\nThey don't spend time alone.\n\n00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:03.657\nEach of them is in a romantic relationship\n\n00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.829\nand each has a rich repertoire of friends.\n\n00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:11.230\nBut watch out here -- this is merely\ncorrelational data, not causal,\n\n00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:14.852\nand it's about happiness\nin the first, \"Hollywood\" sense,\n\n00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:16.088\nI'm going to talk about,\n\n00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:20.278\nhappiness of ebullience\nand giggling and good cheer.\n\n00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:23.137\nAnd I'm going to suggest to you\nthat's not nearly enough,\n\n00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:24.311\nin just a moment.\n\n00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:29.763\nWe found we could begin to look\nat interventions over the centuries,\n\n00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:31.580\nfrom the Buddha to Tony Robbins.\n\n00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:36.387\nAbout 120 interventions have been proposed\nthat allegedly make people happy.\n\n00:08:36.814 --> 00:08:41.436\nAnd we find that we've been able\nto manualize many of them,\n\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.379\nand we actually carry out\n\n00:08:43.403 --> 00:08:47.045\nrandom-assignment efficacy\nand effectiveness studies.\n\n00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:51.225\nThat is, which ones actually\nmake people lastingly happier?\n\n00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:54.476\nIn a couple of minutes, I'll tell you\nabout some of those results.\n\n00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.934\nBut the upshot of this is that the mission\nI want psychology to have,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.445\nin addition to its mission\nof curing the mentally ill,\n\n00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:08.743\nand in addition to its mission of making\nmiserable people less miserable,\n\n00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:12.338\nis, can psychology actually\nmake people happier?\n\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.866\nAnd to ask that question -- \"happy\"\nis not a word I use very much --\n\n00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:18.806\nwe've had to break it down\n\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.362\ninto what I think\nis askable about \"happy.\"\n\n00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:24.372\nAnd I believe there are three different --\n\n00:09:25.137 --> 00:09:28.420\nI call them \"different\" because different\ninterventions build them,\n\n00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:30.845\nit's possible to have one\nrather than the other --\n\n00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:32.846\nthree different happy lives.\n\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.987\nThe first happy life is the pleasant life.\n\n00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:39.396\nThis is a life in which you have\nas much positive emotion\n\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.934\nas you possibly can,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.059\nand the skills to amplify it.\n\n00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.263\nThe second is a life of engagement:\n\n00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:50.652\na life in your work, your parenting,\nyour love, your leisure;\n\n00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:51.982\ntime stops for you.\n\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.148\nThat's what Aristotle was talking about.\n\n00:09:55.172 --> 00:09:57.239\nAnd third, the meaningful life.\n\n00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.934\nI want to say a little bit\nabout each of those lives\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.775\nand what we know about them.\n\n00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:06.777\nThe first life is the pleasant life,\nand it's simply, as best we can find it,\n\n00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.088\nit's having as many\nof the pleasures as you can,\n\n00:10:09.112 --> 00:10:11.221\nas much positive emotion as you can,\n\n00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:17.733\nand learning the skills -- savoring,\nmindfulness -- that amplify them,\n\n00:10:18.072 --> 00:10:20.934\nthat stretch them over time and space.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.934\nBut the pleasant life has three drawbacks,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.466\nand it's why positive psychology\nis not happy-ology,\n\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.367\nand why it doesn't end here.\n\n00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.934\nThe first drawback is,\nit turns out the pleasant life,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.395\nyour experience of positive emotion,\n\n00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:41.340\nis about 50 percent heritable,\n\n00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:44.934\nand, in fact, not very modifiable.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.497\nSo the different tricks\nthat Matthieu and I and others know\n\n00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:53.132\nabout increasing the amount\nof positive emotion in your life\n\n00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:57.132\nare 15 to 20 percent tricks,\ngetting more of it.\n\n00:10:57.454 --> 00:11:01.696\nSecond is that positive\nemotion habituates.\n\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.520\nIt habituates rapidly, indeed.\n\n00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:07.914\nIt's all like French vanilla ice cream:\n\n00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.553\nthe first taste is 100 percent;\n\n00:11:10.577 --> 00:11:12.746\nby the time you're down\nto the sixth taste,\n\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.927\nit's gone.\n\n00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:18.747\nAnd, as I said,\nit's not particularly malleable.\n\n00:11:20.398 --> 00:11:22.265\nAnd this leads to the second life.\n\n00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:24.227\nI have to tell you about my friend Len,\n\n00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:30.162\nto talk about why positive psychology\nis more than positive emotion,\n\n00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:31.934\nmore than building pleasure.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.934\nIn two of the three great arenas\nof life, by the time Len was 30,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.382\nLen was enormously successful.\n\n00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:41.934\nThe first arena was work.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.594\nBy the time he was 20,\nhe was an options trader.\n\n00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:47.045\nBy the time he was 25,\nhe was a multimillionaire\n\n00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:49.415\nand the head of an options\ntrading company.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:55.105\nSecond, in play, he's a national\nchampion bridge player.\n\n00:11:57.164 --> 00:12:01.934\nBut in the third great arena of life,\nlove, Len is an abysmal failure.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.900\nAnd the reason he was,\nwas that Len is a cold fish.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.108\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:10.052 --> 00:12:11.958\nLen is an introvert.\n\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.934\nAmerican women said to Len,\nwhen he dated them,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.934\n\"You're no fun. You don't have\npositive emotion. Get lost.\"\n\n00:12:22.745 --> 00:12:27.934\nAnd Len was wealthy enough to be able\nto afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.702\nwho for five years tried\nto find the sexual trauma\n\n00:12:31.726 --> 00:12:35.152\nthat had somehow locked\npositive emotion inside of him.\n\n00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:38.849\nBut it turned out there wasn't\nany sexual trauma.\n\n00:12:38.873 --> 00:12:41.064\nIt turned out that --\n\n00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.467\nLen grew up in Long Island\n\n00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:49.073\nand he played football\nand watched football, and played bridge.\n\n00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:54.544\nLen is in the bottom five percent\nof what we call positive affectivities.\n\n00:12:54.568 --> 00:12:56.353\nThe question is: Is Len unhappy?\n\n00:12:56.616 --> 00:12:58.035\nAnd I want to say, not.\n\n00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:01.344\nContrary to what psychology told us\n\n00:13:01.368 --> 00:13:05.520\nabout the bottom 50 percent\nof the human race in positive affectivity,\n\n00:13:05.544 --> 00:13:08.136\nI think Len is one\nof the happiest people I know.\n\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.806\nHe's not consigned\nto the hell of unhappiness,\n\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.745\nand that's because Len, like most of you,\n\n00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:16.831\nis enormously capable of flow.\n\n00:13:16.855 --> 00:13:19.829\nWhen he walks onto the floor\nof the American Exchange\n\n00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:21.603\nat 9:30 in the morning,\n\n00:13:22.116 --> 00:13:23.407\ntime stops for him.\n\n00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:25.193\nAnd it stops till the closing bell.\n\n00:13:25.217 --> 00:13:28.117\nWhen the first card is played\ntill 10 days later,\n\n00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.499\nwhen the tournament is over,\n\n00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:30.933\ntime stops for Len.\n\n00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:34.846\nAnd this is indeed\nwhat Mike Csikszentmihalyi\n\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.772\nhas been talking about, about flow.\n\n00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:40.173\nAnd it's distinct from pleasure\nin a very important way:\n\n00:13:40.197 --> 00:13:45.601\npleasure has raw feel -- you know\nit's happening; it's thought and feeling.\n\n00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:48.714\nBut what Mike told you\nyesterday -- during flow ...\n\n00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:52.982\nyou can't feel anything.\n\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.181\nYou're one with the music.\n\n00:13:56.622 --> 00:13:57.875\nTime stops.\n\n00:13:57.899 --> 00:13:59.793\nYou have intense concentration.\n\n00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:04.568\nAnd this is indeed the characteristic\nof what we think of as the good life.\n\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.845\nAnd we think there's a recipe for it,\n\n00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:10.463\nand it's knowing what\nyour highest strengths are --\n\n00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:12.781\nagain, there's a valid test\n\n00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:15.188\nof what your five highest strengths are --\n\n00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:17.941\nand then re-crafting your life\n\n00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:21.225\nto use them as much as you possibly can.\n\n00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:23.934\nRe-crafting your work, your love,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.715\nyour play, your friendship,\nyour parenting.\n\n00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:28.319\nJust one example.\n\n00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:32.654\nOne person I worked with\nwas a bagger at Genuardi's.\n\n00:14:33.114 --> 00:14:34.279\nHated the job.\n\n00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:36.196\nShe's working her way through college.\n\n00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:39.862\nHer highest strength\nwas social intelligence.\n\n00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:44.601\nSo she re-crafted bagging\nto make the encounter with her\n\n00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.396\nthe social highlight\nof every customer's day.\n\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.596\nNow, obviously she failed.\n\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.934\nBut what she did was to take\nher highest strengths,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.366\nand re-craft work to use them\nas much as possible.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.306\nWhat you get out of that\nis not smiley-ness.\n\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.233\nYou don't look like Debbie Reynolds.\n\n00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:02.661\nYou don't giggle a lot.\n\n00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:05.271\nWhat you get is more absorption.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.032\nSo, that's the second path.\n\n00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:10.408\nThe first path, positive emotion;\n\n00:15:10.432 --> 00:15:13.528\nthe second path is eudaemonian flow;\n\n00:15:13.552 --> 00:15:15.934\nand the third path is meaning.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.934\nThis is the most venerable\nof the happinesses, traditionally.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.457\nAnd meaning, in this view, consists of --\n\n00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:26.401\nvery parallel to eudaemonia --\n\n00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.988\nit consists of knowing\nwhat your highest strengths are,\n\n00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:34.655\nand using them to belong to\nand in the service of\n\n00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:36.822\nsomething larger than you are.\n\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.132\nI mentioned that for all three\nkinds of lives --\n\n00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:46.548\nthe pleasant life, the good life,\nthe meaningful life --\n\n00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:48.736\npeople are now\nhard at work on the question:\n\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.687\nAre there things that lastingly\nchange those lives?\n\n00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:56.725\nAnd the answer seems to be yes.\n\n00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:59.304\nAnd I'll just give you some samples of it.\n\n00:15:59.328 --> 00:16:01.492\nIt's being done in a rigorous manner.\n\n00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:04.353\nIt's being done in the same way\nthat we test drugs\n\n00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:05.986\nto see what really works.\n\n00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:11.284\nSo we do random-assignment,\nplacebo-controlled,\n\n00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:14.155\nlong-term studies\nof different interventions.\n\n00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:18.684\nJust to sample the kind of interventions\nthat we find have an effect:\n\n00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.934\nwhen we teach people\nabout the pleasant life,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.934\nhow to have more pleasure in your life,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.977\none of your assignments\nis to take the mindfulness skills,\n\n00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:30.416\nthe savoring skills,\n\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.198\nand you're assigned\nto design a beautiful day.\n\n00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:39.145\nNext Saturday, set a day aside,\ndesign yourself a beautiful day,\n\n00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:43.363\nand use savoring and mindfulness\nto enhance those pleasures.\n\n00:16:43.387 --> 00:16:47.888\nAnd we can show in that way\nthat the pleasant life is enhanced.\n\n00:16:49.696 --> 00:16:50.920\nGratitude visit.\n\n00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:55.697\nI want you all to do this\nwith me now, if you would.\n\n00:16:55.721 --> 00:16:56.969\nClose your eyes.\n\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.114\nI'd like you to remember someone\n\n00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:06.186\nwho did something enormously important\n\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.934\nthat changed your life\nin a good direction,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.891\nand who you never properly thanked.\n\n00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:14.594\nThe person has to be alive.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.121\nNow, OK, you can open your eyes.\n\n00:17:18.145 --> 00:17:20.479\nI hope all of you have such a person.\n\n00:17:20.503 --> 00:17:24.101\nYour assignment, when you're learning\nthe gratitude visit,\n\n00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:27.774\nis to write a 300-word\ntestimonial to that person,\n\n00:17:28.492 --> 00:17:30.421\ncall them on the phone in Phoenix,\n\n00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:33.766\nask if you can visit, don't tell them why.\n\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.293\nShow up at their door,\n\n00:17:36.257 --> 00:17:40.254\nyou read the testimonial --\neveryone weeps when this happens.\n\n00:17:41.537 --> 00:17:44.439\nAnd what happens is, when we test people\n\n00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.582\none week later, a month later,\nthree months later,\n\n00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:50.264\nthey're both happier and less depressed.\n\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.015\nAnother example is a strengths date,\n\n00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:58.221\nin which we get couples to identify\ntheir highest strengths\n\n00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.620\non the strengths test,\n\n00:17:59.644 --> 00:18:04.725\nand then to design an evening\nin which they both use their strengths.\n\n00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:08.242\nWe find this is a strengthener\nof relationships.\n\n00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:10.720\nAnd fun versus philanthropy.\n\n00:18:10.744 --> 00:18:13.464\nIt's so heartening\nto be in a group like this,\n\n00:18:13.488 --> 00:18:17.088\nin which so many of you have turned\nyour lives to philanthropy.\n\n00:18:17.112 --> 00:18:20.770\nWell, my undergraduates and the people\nI work with haven't discovered this,\n\n00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:23.602\nso we actually have people\ndo something altruistic\n\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.044\nand do something fun,\n\n00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:27.309\nand contrast it.\n\n00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:29.934\nAnd what you find\nis when you do something fun,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.847\nit has a square wave walk set.\n\n00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:35.507\nWhen you do something philanthropic\nto help another person,\n\n00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.620\nit lasts and it lasts.\n\n00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:42.004\nSo those are examples\nof positive interventions.\n\n00:18:42.638 --> 00:18:46.054\nSo the next to last thing\nI want to say is:\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.077\nwe're interested in how much\nlife satisfaction people have.\n\n00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.041\nThis is really what you're about.\n\n00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:53.934\nAnd that's our target variable.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.934\nAnd we ask the question as a function\nof the three different lives,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.174\nhow much life satisfaction do you get?\n\n00:19:00.705 --> 00:19:03.810\nSo we ask -- and we've done this\nin 15 replications,\n\n00:19:03.834 --> 00:19:06.212\ninvolving thousands of people:\n\n00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:08.731\nTo what extent does\nthe pursuit of pleasure,\n\n00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:10.527\nthe pursuit of positive emotion,\n\n00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.275\nthe pleasant life,\n\n00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.707\nthe pursuit of engagement,\ntime stopping for you,\n\n00:19:15.731 --> 00:19:19.105\nand the pursuit of meaning\ncontribute to life satisfaction?\n\n00:19:19.129 --> 00:19:22.723\nAnd our results surprised us;\nthey were backward of what we thought.\n\n00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:26.251\nIt turns out the pursuit of pleasure\nhas almost no contribution\n\n00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:27.934\nto life satisfaction.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.487\nThe pursuit of meaning is the strongest.\n\n00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:34.658\nThe pursuit of engagement\nis also very strong.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:39.592\nWhere pleasure matters\nis if you have both engagement\n\n00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:41.225\nand you have meaning,\n\n00:19:41.249 --> 00:19:43.538\nthen pleasure's the whipped\ncream and the cherry.\n\n00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:50.080\nWhich is to say, the full life --\nthe sum is greater than the parts,\n\n00:19:50.104 --> 00:19:51.510\nif you've got all three.\n\n00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:54.776\nConversely, if you have none\nof the three, the empty life,\n\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.457\nthe sum is less than the parts.\n\n00:19:56.481 --> 00:20:00.732\nAnd what we're asking now is:\nDoes the very same relationship --\n\n00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:05.699\nphysical health, morbidity,\nhow long you live and productivity --\n\n00:20:05.723 --> 00:20:07.132\nfollow the same relationship?\n\n00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:09.634\nThat is, in a corporation,\n\n00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:15.497\nis productivity a function of positive\nemotion, engagement and meaning?\n\n00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:18.688\nIs health a function\nof positive engagement,\n\n00:20:18.712 --> 00:20:21.449\nof pleasure, and of meaning in life?\n\n00:20:21.473 --> 00:20:25.688\nAnd there is reason to think the answer\nto both of those may well be yes.\n\n00:20:28.162 --> 00:20:32.591\nSo, Chris said that the last\nspeaker had a chance\n\n00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:35.036\nto try to integrate what he heard,\n\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.766\nand so this was amazing for me.\n\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.084\nI've never been in a gathering like this.\n\n00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:44.483\nI've never seen speakers stretch\nbeyond themselves so much,\n\n00:20:44.507 --> 00:20:46.579\nwhich was one of the remarkable things.\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:50.934\nBut I found that the problems\nof psychology seemed to be parallel\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:55.173\nto the problems of technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:20:55.197 --> 00:20:56.672\nin the following way:\n\n00:20:56.696 --> 00:21:00.178\nwe all know that technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:05.202\nhave been and can be used\nfor destructive purposes.\n\n00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:10.484\nWe also know that technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:21:10.508 --> 00:21:13.027\ncan be used to relieve misery.\n\n00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:16.934\nAnd by the way, the distinction\nbetween relieving misery\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.934\nand building happiness\nis extremely important.\n\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:23.569\nI thought, when I first became\na therapist 30 years ago,\n\n00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:28.934\nthat if I was good enough\nto make someone not depressed,\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:32.006\nnot anxious, not angry,\n\n00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:34.291\nthat I'd make them happy.\n\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.235\nAnd I never found that;\n\n00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:38.281\nI found the best you could ever do\n\n00:21:38.305 --> 00:21:39.707\nwas to get to zero;\n\n00:21:40.308 --> 00:21:41.522\nthat they were empty.\n\n00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:47.152\nAnd it turns out the skills of happiness,\nthe skills of the pleasant life,\n\n00:21:47.176 --> 00:21:49.547\nthe skills of engagement,\nthe skills of meaning,\n\n00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:53.722\nare different from the skills\nof relieving misery.\n\n00:21:54.293 --> 00:21:59.664\nAnd so, the parallel thing holds\nwith technology, entertainment\n\n00:21:59.688 --> 00:22:01.261\nand design, I believe.\n\n00:22:01.285 --> 00:22:08.164\nThat is, it is possible\nfor these three drivers of our world\n\n00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:10.403\nto increase happiness,\n\n00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:13.604\nto increase positive emotion.\n\n00:22:13.628 --> 00:22:15.815\nAnd that's typically\nhow they've been used.\n\n00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:18.449\nBut once you fractionate\nhappiness the way I do --\n\n00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:21.934\nnot just positive emotion,\nthat's not nearly enough --\n\n00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:25.091\nthere's flow in life,\nand there's meaning in life.\n\n00:22:25.464 --> 00:22:26.934\nAs Laura Lee told us,\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:30.626\ndesign and, I believe,\nentertainment and technology,\n\n00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.381\ncan be used to increase meaning\nengagement in life as well.\n\n00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:37.025\nSo in conclusion,\n\n00:22:37.049 --> 00:22:39.476\nthe eleventh reason for optimism,\n\n00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.675\nin addition to the space elevator,\n\n00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:47.830\nis that I think with technology,\nentertainment and design,\n\n00:22:47.854 --> 00:22:51.602\nwe can actually increase\nthe amount of tonnage\n\n00:22:51.626 --> 00:22:53.876\nof human happiness on the planet.\n\n00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:58.742\nAnd if technology can,\nin the next decade or two,\n\n00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:02.630\nincrease the pleasant life,\nthe good life and the meaningful life,\n\n00:23:02.654 --> 00:23:04.144\nit will be good enough.\n\n00:23:04.168 --> 00:23:09.773\nIf entertainment can be diverted\nto also increase positive emotion,\n\n00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:13.019\nmeaning eudaemonia,\n\n00:23:13.043 -->

southern Africa dates back hundreds of years. But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire. Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.So, here you can see the change from use \u2014 starting to use contemporary materials. These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s. In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design. And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year. Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary. So I developed a whole range around \u2014 mass-produced range \u2014 that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms. The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project. It's successful, it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.This is our group, our main group of weavers. They come on a weekly basis to Durban. They all have bank accounts. They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from. It's a weekly turnaround of production. This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of. And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers. And the rest says it all.Thank you very much.

Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence, but that are never sentimental, that never look away from the darkest things about us. Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly. Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of. As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation \u2014 in the '80s \u2014 of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended. So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.But what I've come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures, but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion, everyday acts of compassion. In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu. Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says, the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me. But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window. I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window. Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good. It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes. So what Ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people. It's really very simple, but really very complicated.So, I thought I should start with some stories. I should tell you some stories about remarkable people, so I thought I'd start with my mother. (Laughter) And she was dark, too. My mother was English. My parents met in Oxford in the '50s, and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there. She was five foot two, very feisty and very English. This is how English my mother is \u2014 or was, she just passed. She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me, and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing. (Laughter) And then we went to a fish restaurant, and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us, and he came up and my mother said, \"Do you have any specials, young man?\" And Chad says, \"Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon, that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust. It's totally rad.\" And my mother turned to me and said, \"What language is he speaking?\" (Laughter) I said, \"English, mum.\" And she shook her head and said, \"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language, why don't they use it?\" (Laughter)So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father \u2014 and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert \u2014 decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria, particularly among Igbo women, the Billings ovulation method, which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church. But her Igbo wasn't too good. So she took me along to translate. I was seven. (Laughter) So, here are these women, who never discuss their period with their husbands, and here I am telling them, \"Well, how often do you get your period?\" (Laughter) And, \"Do you notice any discharges?\" (Laughter) And, \"How swollen is your vulva?\" (Laughter) She never would have thought of herself as a feminist, my mother, but she always used to say, \"Anything a man can do, I can fix.\" (Applause) And when my father complained about this situation, where she's taking a seven-year-old boy to teach this birth control, you know, he used to say, \"Oh, you're turning him into \u2014 you're teaching him how to be a woman.\" My mother said, \"Someone has to.\" (Laughter)This woman \u2014 during the Biafran war, we were caught in the war. It was my mother with five little children. It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp, to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country. At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine, and make him a boy soldier. Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman, standing up to men with guns who want to kill us? All through that one year, my mother never cried one time, not once. But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport, about to fly to England, this woman saw my mother wearing this dress, which had been washed so many times it was basically see through, with five really hungry-looking kids, came over and asked her what had happened. And she told this woman. And so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us, and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 that was the only time she cried. And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother, and I asked her, \"Why did you cry then?\" And she said, \"You know, you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror. But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you.\"The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened, memorized the names of every dead person, and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names. Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you. And they would sing them only when they planted the rice, as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice. But when it came for harvest time, they would sing these joyful songs, that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year. And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge, they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born. And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation, beautiful transformation.Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda, the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one? But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda. Did you also know that after apartheid, when the new government went into the parliament houses, there were no female toilets in the building? Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men. All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death, women are never really counted. Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.When I was growing up in Nigeria \u2014 and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general, but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from \u2014 there were always rites of passage for young men. Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women, that's essentially what it is. And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals, progressing along, so when I turned 13 \u2014 and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community, somebody had to kill the animals, there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at \u2014 so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat. And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it, but I had to do it. And I was supposed to do this alone. But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel, who was significantly older than me, who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war, decided to come with me. Which sort of made me feel good, because he'd seen a lot of things. Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people, and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running. So, this guy comes with me. And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one \u2014 they sound like human beings, that's why we call tragedies \"a song of a goat.\" My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats. Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't, Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat, covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them, while I kill the goat. It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much, and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience, still found it in himself to try to protect me. I was a wimp. I cried for a very long time. And afterwards, he didn't say a word. He just sat there watching me cry for an hour. And then afterwards he said to me, \"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time, you will die of heartbreak. Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult.\" Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep, and not in good ways. (Laughter)So, I was born two days after Christmas. So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything, but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas. So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany, and we had the Catholic priest over, my mother was entertaining him with tea. And my uncle suddenly says, \"Where are Chris' presents?\" And my mother said, \"Don't talk about that in front of guests.\" But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back, so he summoned me up, and he said, \"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom. Take anything you want out of the suitcase. It's your birthday present.\" I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt, but I found an inflatable sheep. (Laughter) So, I blew it up and ran into the living room, my finger where it shouldn't have been, I was waving this buzzing sheep around, and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock. (Laughter) And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered, just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said, \"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish.\" (Laughter) (Applause)My last days in prison, the last 18 months, my cellmate \u2014 for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months \u2014 my cellmate was 14 years old. The name was John James, and in those days, if a family member committed a crime, the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in. So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row. And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner. There were some really bad people there. And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books \u2014 \"Spiderman\" and \"X-Men.\" He was obsessed. And when he got tired of reading them, he started to teach the men in death row how to read, with these comic books. And so, I remember night after night, you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals, huddled around John James, reciting, \"Take that, Spidey!\" (Laughter) It's incredible. I was really worried. He didn't know what death row meant. I'd been there twice, and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die. And he would always laugh, and say, \"Come on, man, we'll make it out.\" Then I'd say, \"How do you know?\" And he said, \"Oh, I heard it on the grapevine.\" They killed him. They handcuffed him to a chair, and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail, then left him there to bleed to death. That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known. All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods. They would come together as a community, and they would express a wish. And their wish would then be brought to a priest, who would find a ritual object, and the appropriate sacrifices would be made, and the shrine would be built for the god. But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice, the Igbos would destroy the god. They would knock down the shrine, and they would stop saying the god's name. This is how they came to reclaim their humanity. Every day, all of us here, we're building gods that have gone rampant, and it's time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names. It doesn't require a tremendous thing. All it requires is to recognize among us, every day \u2014 the few of us that can see \u2014 are surrounded by people like the ones I've told you.There are some of you in this room, amazing people, who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity. I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton. The poem is called \"Libation,\" and it's for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere. \"Libation, North Carolina, 1999. I offer to this ground, this gin. I imagine an old man crying here, out of the sight of the overseer. He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be, if he were whole. It aches in that space where his tooth would be, where his land would be, his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter. He wipes sorrow from his face, and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue, and tastes the salt. I call a name that could be his. This is for you, old man.

We gave them a language,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhy don't they use it?\"\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo, this woman, who converted from the Church of England\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nto Catholicism when she married my father --\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\ndecided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nparticularly among Igbo women,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthe Billings ovulation method,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwhich was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nBut her Igbo wasn't too good.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo she took me along to translate.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI was seven.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo, here are these women,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwho never discuss their period with their husbands,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand here I am telling them, \"Well, how often do you get your period?\"\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd, \"Do you notice any discharges?\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd, \"How swollen is your vulva?\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nShe never would have thought of herself as a feminist,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nmy mother, but she always used to say,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n\"Anything a man can do, I can fix.\"\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd when my father complained about this situation,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nwhere she's taking a seven-year-old boy\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nto teach this birth control, you know,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nhe used to say, \"Oh, you're turning him into --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nyou're teaching him how to be a woman.\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nMy mother said, \"Someone has to.\"\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThis woman -- during the Biafran war,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwe were caught in the war.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt was my mother with five little children.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIt takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nto make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAt every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwho want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand make him a boy soldier.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nCan you imagine this five-foot-two woman,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nstanding up to men with guns who want to kill us?\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAll through that one year,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nmy mother never cried one time, not once.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nBut when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout to fly to England,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthis woman saw my mother wearing this dress,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhich had been washed so many times it was basically see through,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwith five really hungry-looking kids,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\ncame over and asked her what had happened.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd she told this woman.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd so this woman emptied out her suitcase\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat was the only time she cried.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand I asked her, \"Why did you cry then?\"\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd she said, \"You know, you can steel your heart\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nagainst any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nBut the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwill unstitch you.\"\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nmemorized the names of every dead person,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nDirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd they would sing them only when they planted the rice,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nas though they were seeding the hearts of the dead\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\ninto the rice.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nBut when it came for harvest time,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthey would sing these joyful songs,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat were made up of the names of every child\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwho had been born that year.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthey would remove as many names of the dead\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat equaled as many people that were born.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nbeautiful transformation.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nDid you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthe word for rape and the word for marriage\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwas the same one?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nDid you also know that after apartheid,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwhen the new government went into the parliament houses,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nthere were no female toilets in the building?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhich would seem to suggest that apartheid\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwas entirely the business of men.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAll of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwomen are never really counted.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nTheir humanity never seems to matter very much to us.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWhen I was growing up in Nigeria --\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nbut in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthere were always rites of passage for young men.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nMen were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthat's essentially what it is.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nprogressing along, so when I turned 13 --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nsomebody had to kill the animals,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthere was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nso when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbut I had to do it.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd I was supposed to do this alone.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nBut a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwho was significantly older than me,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwho'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\ndecided to come with me.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nWhich sort of made me feel good,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbecause he'd seen a lot of things.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nNow, when I was growing up, he used to tell me\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nstories about how he used to bayonet people,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo, this guy comes with me.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthey sound like human beings,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat's why we call tragedies \"a song of a goat.\"\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nMy friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nuntil we started keeping goats.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nEmmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\ncovers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwhile I kill the goat.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nIt didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nsuch a quotidian experience,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nstill found it in himself to try to protect me.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nI was a wimp.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nI cried for a very long time.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd afterwards, he didn't say a word.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nHe just sat there watching me cry for an hour.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd then afterwards he said to me,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.958\n\"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nyou will die of heartbreak.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nJust know that it is enough sometimes\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nto know that it is difficult.\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nOf course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand not in good ways.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSo, I was born two days after Christmas.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbut I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nSo, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand we had the Catholic priest over,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nmy mother was entertaining him with tea.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd my uncle suddenly says, \"Where are Chris' presents?\"\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd my mother said, \"Don't talk about that in front of guests.\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBut he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nso he summoned me up, and he said,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\n\"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nTake anything you want out of the suitcase.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nIt's your birthday present.\"\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nI'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nbut I found an inflatable sheep.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nSo, I blew it up and ran into the living room,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nmy finger where it shouldn't have been,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI was waving this buzzing sheep around,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\njust stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\n\"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish.\"\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nMy last days in prison, the last 18 months,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nmy cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nmy cellmate was 14 years old.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe name was John James,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand in those days, if a family member committed a crime,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthe military would hold you as ransom\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\ntill your family turned themselves in.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThere were some really bad people there.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nAnd he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\n\"Spiderman\" and \"X-Men.\"\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nHe was obsessed.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd when he got tired of reading them,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nhe started to teach the men in death row how to read,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nwith these comic books.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd so, I remember night after night,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nyou'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nhuddled around John James, reciting, \"Take that, Spidey!\"\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's incredible.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nI was really worried.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nHe didn't know what death row meant.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI'd been there twice,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nand I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd he would always laugh, and say,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\n\"Come on, man, we'll make it out.\"\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThen I'd say, \"How do you know?\"\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd he said, \"Oh, I heard it on the grapevine.\"\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThey killed him.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThey handcuffed him to a chair,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthen left him there to bleed to death.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThat's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAll around us, everywhere, there are people like this.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThe Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThey would come together as a community,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand they would express a wish.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd their wish would then be brought to a priest,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwho would find a ritual object,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand the appropriate sacrifices would be made,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand the shrine would be built for the god.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nBut if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthe Igbos would destroy the god.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThey would knock down the shrine,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nand they would stop saying the god's name.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThis is how they came to reclaim their humanity.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nEvery day, all of us here,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwe're building gods that have gone rampant,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand it's time we started knocking them down\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand forgetting their names.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIt doesn't require a tremendous thing.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAll it requires is to recognize among us, every day --\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthe few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nlike the ones I've told you.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThere are some of you in this room, amazing people,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwho offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThe poem is called \"Libation,\" and it's for my friend Vusi\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwho is in the audience here somewhere.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\n\"Libation,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nNorth Carolina, 1999.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nI offer to this ground, this gin.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nI imagine an old man crying here,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nout of the sight of the overseer.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nHe pushes his tongue through a hole\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwhere his tooth would be, if he were whole.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nIt aches in that space where his tooth would be,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nwhere his land would be,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nhis house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nHe wipes sorrow from his face,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nand puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand tastes the salt.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nI call a name that could be his.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nThis is for you, old man.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThis gin, this salty

"https://www.ted.com/talks/louise_leakey_digs_for_humanity_s_origins", "transcript": "Who are we? That is the big question. And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape. This could be us. We belong to the family called the Hominidae. We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today. And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. We're one species out of approximately, or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years. But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us. And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes. It's important to remember that we evolved. Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. We have a common past, and we have a common future. And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.And this is how we look for them. A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface. And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils. I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. (Laughter) It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past. We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.When we find a fossil, we mark it. Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS. We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it. And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today. When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes. And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors. And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother. (Laughter) Not many people can say that.But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago. I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape. Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley. It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi. And the Rift Valley is a depression. It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface. And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you. (Laughter) OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become \u2014 to be \u2014 preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface. And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya. And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin, which represents some 20,000 square miles. That's a huge job that we've got on our hands. Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region. You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor. And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there. (Laughter)But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm. In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. Where did these things come from? That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception. Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana.But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains. And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile. And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that. But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died. And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned. His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so. He was very able to use stones effectively as tools. And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child. He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller, members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12. Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out. Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved.And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid. It's actually this little piece up here on the top. Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment. And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope. We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus. It was truly exciting. He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human.Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia. So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia. But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height. But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about.Just to put this in terms of generations, because people do find it hard to think of time, Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago. We evolved essentially from an African stock. Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us. And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago. And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet Earth.The question now is, well, who are we? We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps. (Laughter) For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all. We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?And what is it that really makes us us? I think it's our collective intelligence. It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness. From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places. Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing. As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us, we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet. Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time. We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.And last year, our population grew by 80 million. I mean, these are extraordinary numbers. You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book. But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today. But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species.My father so appropriately put it, that \"We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species.\" Can we hold it together? It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. We all have an African origin. We have a common past and we share a common future. Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip. We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today. We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to. But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end. I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

Earth today.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd that's just a tiny fraction of all species\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nthat have ever lived on the planet in past times.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nWe're one species out of approximately,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nor let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat have existed over the past six to eight million years.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nBut as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthat exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd it's important to remember that,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nbecause the bonobos are so human,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand they share 99 percent of their genes with us.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nIt's important to remember that we evolved.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nNow, I know that's a dirty word for some people,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nbut we evolved from common ancestors\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwith the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWe have a common past, and we have a common future.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd it is important to remember that all of these great apes\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nhave come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nas we ourselves have today.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand it's this journey that has been the focus\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nof the past three generations of my family,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nas we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nof our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd this is how we look for them.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nA group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nout across vast areas of Africa,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nlooking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd that's an example of what we may do as we walk across\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthe landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nI doubt many of you in the audience can see\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthe fossil that's in this picture,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nbut if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nof a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nas it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIt's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nto begin to piece together our past.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWe still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWhen we find a fossil, we mark it.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nToday, we've got great technology: we have GPS.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWe mark it with a GPS fix,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nso we could essentially put it back on the surface,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nexactly where we found it.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nWhen we then find something very important,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nlike the bones of a human ancestor,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nusing dental picks and fine paintbrushes.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd all the sediment is then put through these screens,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand where we go again through it very carefully,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nlooking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nor the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwere digging up some remains of human ancestors.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd it is one of the most special things\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto ever do with your mother.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNot many people can say that.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBut now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nit does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNow we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nIt essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nor runs down to Lake Malawi.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd the Rift Valley is a depression.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nIt's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\ncarrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nIf you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwhere your bones will be rapidly buried.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nYou then hope that the earth moves in such a way\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nas to bring the bones back up to the surface.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd then you hope that one of us lot\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwill walk around and find small pieces of you.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nOK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nas we do know today about our ancestors,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbecause it's incredibly difficult,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nA, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nSo, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nin the very north of our country, Kenya.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nof the animals that lived there.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nFossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwhich represents some 20,000 square miles.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nThat's a huge job that we've got on our hands.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nTwo million years ago at Lake Turkana,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nHomo erectus, one of our human ancestors,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nactually lived in this region.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nYou can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nin the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nHomo erectus, up in the far right corner,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nlived alongside three other species of human ancestor.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd here is a skull of a Homo erectus,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwhich I just pulled off the shelf there.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nBut it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIn fact, if you go back in time,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nor of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWhere did these things come from?\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThat's what we're still trying to find answers to,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand it is important to realize that there is diversity\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nin all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nHere's some reconstructions of some of the fossils\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthat have been found from Lake Turkana.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nessentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nin search of human remains.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nfossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut when I was 12, as I was in this picture,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\na very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhen they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nbecause I was the same age that he was when he died.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nHis brothers certainly were able to run long distances\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nchasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nHe was very able to use stones effectively as tools.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nactually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nHe had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nquite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nmembers of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nUnfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand couldn't get out.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nEssentially, his bones were rapidly buried\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nand beautifully preserved.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd he remained there until 1.6 million years later,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhen this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nwalked along a small hillside\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\namongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's actually this little piece up here on the top.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nWell, an excavation was begun immediately,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand more and more little bits of skull\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nstarted to be extracted from the sediment.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd what was so fun about it was this:\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthe skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand fairly recently the tree had grown up,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nbut it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nholding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthings that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was truly exciting.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nHe had a body very similar to our own,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand he was on the threshold of becoming human.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nWell, shortly afterwards, members of his species\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nstarted to move northwards out of Africa,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand you start to see fossils of Homo erectus\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nSo, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand begin its spread across the globe.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nSome exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nfrom Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nBut also, surprising finds\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nrecently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwhere a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nBut they lived only 18,000 years ago,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand that is truly extraordinary to think about.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nJust to put this in terms of generations,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nbecause people do find it hard to think of time,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHomo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWe evolved essentially from an African stock.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAgain, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nshared the planet Earth.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThe question now is, well, who are we?\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nWe're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwith a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nFor the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nWe have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nIs this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd what is it that really makes us us?\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nI think it's our collective intelligence.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nIt's our ability to write things down,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nour language and our consciousness.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nFrom very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nwe now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhas really reached unprecedented levels:\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwe've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd we've also managed to communicate with people\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nall over the world, from extraordinary places.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nEven from within an excavation in northern Kenya,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwe can talk to people about what we're doing.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAs Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nwe have reached extraordinary numbers\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nof people on this planet.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nHuman ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nif you look at the fossil record,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nfor about, on average, a million years at a time.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nWe've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nyet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd last year, our population grew by 80 million.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nI mean, these are extraordinary numbers.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nYou can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBut what's happened is our technology\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nhas removed the checks and balances on our population growth.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nas anything else that's being done in the world today.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nBut we have to control our numbers,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbecause we can't really hold it together as a species.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nMy father so appropriately put it,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nthat \"We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nthat are bad for our survival as a species.\"\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nCan we hold it together?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nIt's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe all have an African origin.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWe have a common past and we share a common future.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nEvolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe're sitting on the edge of a precipice,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nand we have the tools and the technology at our hands\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto communicate what needs to be done\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nto hold it together today.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nBut will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nWell, to end on a very positive note,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nI think evolutionarily speaking,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthis is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI'll leave it at that, thank you very much.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The web as art", "duration": "1229", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_harris_collects_stories", "transcript": "So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways. This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life. You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons. Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories. So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made. And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality \u2014 so, real stories. And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories, stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life, which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently. So I'll be talking about each of those today. So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks. I have many of these books, and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years. They accompany me wherever I go in my life, and I fill them with all sorts of things, records of my lived experience: so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see, dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins, business cards, writings. And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet. And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years, I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts, but also the artifacts of other people. So, I started collecting found objects. This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City about 10 years ago. On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face, and on the back it says, \"To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice. Have fun in whatever you do.\" And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life. As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story, and then letting your own mind fill in the rest. And that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today. So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University, and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts, not just from street corners, but also from the Internet. And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives. Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions, all of these things were being expressed by people online, and leaving behind trails. So, I started to write computer programs that study very, very large sets of these online footprints. One such project is about a year and a half old. It's called \"We Feel Fine.\" This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases \"I feel\" and \"I am feeling.\" And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author. So, their gender, their age, their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence. It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half, having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now. This is, then, how they're presented. These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's feelings from the last few hours, each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger. And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside, so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad. And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside. So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer. \"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,\" from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan. \"I got this on some trading locally, but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.\" Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts. And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created, which consist of the sentence and images being combined. And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside. \"I feel good.\" \"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds, but it was worth it.\" \"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature \u2014 butterflies, man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python.\" So the next movement is called mobs. This provides a slightly more statistical look at things. This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now, dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on. Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around, the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down, and the snowy ones flutter to the ground. You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside. Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution. So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from \"We Feel Fine.\" These are the images that are automatically constructed. \"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.\" (Laughter) \"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good, the kisses felt messy and wrong, but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.\" \"I can feel my cancer grow.\" \"I feel pretty.\" \"I feel skinny, but I'm not.\" \"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict, and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.\" \"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month, because I feel the need for speed.\" (Laughter) \"I feel sassy.\" \"I feel so sexy in this new wig.\" As you can see, \"We Feel Fine\" collects very, very small-scale personal stories. Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words. So, really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story. And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story. And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world, not with the Internet, and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium. So these are some newer projects that actually aren't even launched publicly yet. The first such one is called \"The Whale Hunt.\" Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost settlement in the United States, with a family of Inupiat Eskimos, documenting their annual spring whale hunt. This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore, camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice. And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here, waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does, it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up under the ice, and cuts it up. And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time. So I went up there, and I lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience, beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York, and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later. I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals. So every five minutes, I took a photograph. When I was awake, with the camera around my neck. When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer. And then in moments of high adrenaline, like when something exciting was happening, I would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes. So what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat. That was the first concept here. The second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story. What are the things that make up a story? So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts. Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts. They have colors. What do they look like? They have time. When did it take place? Dates \u2014 when did it occur? And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level. The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to \u2014 things like novels, radio, photographs, movies, even lectures like this one \u2014 we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position, some kind of omniscient, external body through whose eyes you see the story. We're very used to this. But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all. I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex, and there's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other. And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of \"The Whale Hunt,\" how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford, involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3, with an excitement level of high? So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story? I built a web interface for viewing \"The Whale Hunt\" that attempts to do just this. So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there. This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean, and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later. You can start to see some of the story here, told by color. So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I was staying. And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean. Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up. You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story. These are organized chronologically. Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same, so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically. And any of these can be clicked, and then the narrative is entered at that position. So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska. That's \"Moby Dick.\" This is the food we ate. This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us. Cigarette break outside \u2014 I don't smoke. This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping. This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean. This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph, showing the exciting moments of adrenaline. This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built. And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories. So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in \"The Whale Hunt\" and the two whales that were killed down here. And we could do something as arbitrary as, say, extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast. And now we've whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs, and then we can enter the narrative at that position. And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here. These whales are about 40 feet long, and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source for the community for much of the year. Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass. They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades, and an incredibly efficient process. This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass. This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution. It's baleen. Moving on. So what I'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet. So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that, I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. And I was doing a project there about happiness, interviewing a lot of local people. So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product, and they've been doing this since the '70s. And it leads to just a completely different value system. It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture, where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy. So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas. So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions, and took a number of set photographs, and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures. I would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd. And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold. So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons, and some really sad soul holding one balloon. But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy. (Laughter) And then I would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy. And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish. And when they made a wish, I would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it. So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with. This is an 11-year-old student. He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town, and they all had plastic toy guns. His wish was to become a police officer. He was getting started early. Those were his hands. I took pictures of everybody's hands, because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody, and asked everybody to make a funny face. A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy. She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan, and it's a lot easier if you're a boy. A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner. If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there. He wanted to help poor people. A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat, and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make. She wanted to keep farming until she dies. You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here. She was wearing this silver ring that had the word \"love\" engraved on it, and she'd found it in the road somewhere. A 16-year-old quarry worker. This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight, but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer. A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy. He wanted to live a long life at the monastery. He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face, which I'm told is very good luck. He was kind of too shy to make a funny face. A 16-year-old student. She wanted to become an independent woman. I asked her about that, and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married, because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman, your chances to live an independent life kind of end, and so she had no interest in that. A 24-year-old truck driver. There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic, with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road, and he was driving one of these trucks. But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people. A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break. She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road. Her wish was to marry someone with a car. She wanted a change in her life. She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road, and she wanted a different lot on things. An 81-year-old itinerant farmer. I saw this guy on the side of the road, and he actually doesn't have a home. He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work, and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at. So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live. He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face. It was all good-natured. A 10-year-old. He wanted to join a school and learn to read, but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school. He was eating this orange, sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into, and since there was so much saliva on his hands, this orange paste started to form on his palms. (Laughter) A 37-year-old road worker. One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads, and then they send these people home once the roads are built. So these guys were in a worker's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway. His wish was to make some money and open a store. A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road. I asked her about her wish, and she said, \"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish.\" She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red. Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to. Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet. I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said, \"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent, but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage.\" And I said, \"You mean, like a cave?\" And she said, \"Yeah, like a cave.\" And I said, \"Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?\" And she said, \"Well, you know, I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.\" I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way \u2014 with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter \u2014 that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from. But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years. I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know. What if she saw the truth after just one year, what would she do for the next 35 years in her life? And this is what she said. Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe \u2014 maybe I'll die. Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes. JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time. Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die within one year, or something like that. JH: Are you hoping to? Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent. JH: Yeah, but \u2014 yeah, OK. Do you hope \u2014 would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years, or to live for one year? Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50. JH: 40 to 50? Yeah. Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven. JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it. Woman: Thank you. JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. So thank you again, so much. Woman: You're most welcome. JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die when she was around 40. That was enough life for her. So, the last thing we did, very quickly, is I took all those wish balloons \u2014 there were 117 interviews, 117 wishes \u2014 and I brought them up to a place called Dochula, which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet, one of the more sacred places in Bhutan. And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years. And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string, and hung them up there among the prayer flags. And they're actually still flying up there today. So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future, you can go check these out. Here are some images from that. We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true. You can start to see some familiar balloons here. \"To make some money and to open a store\" was the Indian road worker. Thanks very much. (Applause)", "id": 316, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo I'm going to talk today about collecting stories\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nin some unconventional ways.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThis is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nYou might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nAnyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nin collecting imaginary stories.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nSo this is a picture of me\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nholding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nfrom reality -- so, real stories.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nstories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nwhich is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nSo I'll be talking about each of those today.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nSo, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nI have many of these books,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThey accompany me wherever I go in my life,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nand I fill them with all sorts of things,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nrecords of my lived experience:\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nso watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\ndead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nbusiness cards, writings.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nAnd in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nof moments and experiences and people that I meet.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nAnd, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nI started to become very interested in collecting\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nnot only my own personal artifacts,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbut also the artifacts of other people.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nSo, I started collecting found objects.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThis is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nabout 10 years ago.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nOn the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand on the back it says, \"To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nHave fun in whatever you do.\"\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAs opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand then letting your own mind fill in the rest.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd that idea of a partial glimpse is something\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nthat will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nand I noticed that it was suddenly possible\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto collect these sorts of personal artifacts,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nnot just from street corners, but also from the Internet.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nof digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBlog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nall of these things were being expressed by people online,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand leaving behind trails.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, I started to write computer programs\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat study very, very large sets of these online footprints.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nOne such project is about a year and a half old.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nIt's called \"We Feel Fine.\"\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nevery two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n\"I feel\" and \"I am feeling.\" And when it finds one of those phrases,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nit grabs the full sentence up to the period\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand also tries to identify demographic information about the author.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nSo, their gender, their age, their geographic location\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nIt collects about 20,000 such sentences a day\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand it's been running for about a year and a half,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nhaving collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nThis is, then, how they're presented.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThese dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nfeelings from the last few hours,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\neach dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nso the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd the diameter of each dot corresponds\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nto the length of the sentence inside.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nSo the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n\"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfor why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,\"\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nfrom a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\n\"I got this on some trading locally,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbut really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.\"\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAlso, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwhich consist of the sentence and images being combined.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"I feel good.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\n\"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nbut it was worth it.\"\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n\"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthat makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nman-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python.\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nSo the next movement is called mobs.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThis provides a slightly more statistical look at things.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThis is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\ndominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nWeather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nof the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthe cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand the snowy ones flutter to the ground.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nYou can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\non a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from \"We Feel Fine.\"\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThese are the images that are automatically constructed.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\n\"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.\"\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n\"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthe kisses felt messy and wrong,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbut kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.\"\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n\"I can feel my cancer grow.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n\"I feel pretty.\"\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\n\"I feel skinny, but I'm not.\"\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\n\"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.\"\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\n\"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbecause I feel the need for speed.\"\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:31.958\n\"I feel sassy.\"\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n\"I feel so sexy in this new wig.\"\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAs you can see, \"We Feel Fine\" collects\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nvery, very small-scale personal stories.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSometimes, stories as short as two or three words.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, really even challenging the notion\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nof what can be considered a story.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nnot with the Internet,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo these are some newer projects that\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nactually aren't even launched publicly yet.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe first such one is called \"The Whale Hunt.\"\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nLast May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthe northernmost settlement in the United States,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwith a family of Inupiat Eskimos,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\ndocumenting their annual spring whale hunt.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThis is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\ncamping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd that water that you see there is the open lead,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwaits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nit throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nunder the ice, and cuts it up.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo I went up there, and I lived with these guys\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nout in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nbeginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nSo every five minutes, I took a photograph.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nWhen I was awake, with the camera around my neck.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nWhen I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd then in moments of high adrenaline,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nlike when something exciting was happening,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nI would up that photographic frequency to as many as\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n37 photographs in five minutes.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nSo what this created was a photographic heartbeat\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat sped up and slowed down, more or less matching\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthe changing pace of my own heartbeat.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThat was the first concept here.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe second concept was to use this experience to think about\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe fundamental components of any story.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWhat are the things that make up a story?\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nStories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThey have colors. What do they look like?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThey have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThe thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthat we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nphotographs, movies, even lectures like this one --\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwe're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nsome kind of omniscient, external body\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthrough whose eyes you see the story.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nWe're very used to this.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nBut if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nI mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand there's all of these overlapping stories\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nintersecting and touching each other.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nto surface those types of stories. So, in the case of \"The Whale Hunt,\"\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nhow could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\ninvolving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ndominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwith an excitement level of high?\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nI built a web interface for viewing \"The Whale Hunt\" that attempts to do just this.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSo these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThis is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nYou can start to see some of the story here, told by color.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nSo this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nin the basement apartment where I was staying.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIntroduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nYou can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThese are organized chronologically.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nso these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd any of these can be clicked,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand then the narrative is entered at that position.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThat's \"Moby Dick.\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThis is the food we ate.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThis is in the Patkotak's family living room\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nin their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nCigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThis is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThis is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThis graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nreminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nshowing the exciting moments of adrenaline.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nThis is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in \"The Whale Hunt\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand the two whales that were killed down here.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd we could do something as arbitrary as, say,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nextract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nat Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd now we've whittled down that whole story\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto just 29 matching photographs,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand then we can enter the narrative at that position.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThese whales are about 40 feet long,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nfor the community for much of the year.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSkipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThey use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand an incredibly efficient process.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nThis is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThis is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nIt's baleen. Moving on.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo what I'm going to tell you about next\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nis a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nSo, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nnestled between Tibet and India.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd I was doing a project there about happiness,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\ninterviewing a lot of local people.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nmost of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nof gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand they've been doing this since the '70s.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd it leads to just a completely different value system.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nIt's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwhere people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand took a number of set photographs,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nI would start by asking people to rate their happiness\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbetween one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand give them that number of balloons to hold.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand some really sad soul holding one balloon.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd then I would ask them a number of questions like\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwhat was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAnd when they made a wish, I would write their wish\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nonto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSo I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nof some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nThis is an 11-year-old student.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nHe was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand they all had plastic toy guns.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nHis wish was to become a police officer.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nHe was getting started early. Those were his hands.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nI took pictures of everybody's hands,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nbecause I think you can often tell a lot about somebody\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nfrom how their hands look.

She was selling oranges on the side of the road.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nI asked her about her wish, and she said,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\n\"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish.\"\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nShe was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nover the years to turn very red.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nFinally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nHer wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nI asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\n\"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nbut my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage.\"\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nAnd I said, \"You mean, like a cave?\" And she said, \"Yeah, like a cave.\"\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nAnd I said, \"Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?\"\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, you know,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nI think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.\"\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nI just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwith amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nthat made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\non the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nBut here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nI asked her a little bit more about the cave\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nand what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nWhat if she saw the truth after just one year,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nwhat would she do for the next 35 years in her life?\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nAnd this is what she said.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nWoman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nJonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nJH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nWoman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nwithin one year, or something like that.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nJH: Are you hoping to?\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nWoman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nJH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nwould you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nor to live for one year?\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nWoman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nJH: 40 to 50? Yeah.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nWoman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nJH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nWoman: Thank you.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nJH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nSo thank you again, so much.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nWoman: You're most welcome.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nJH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nwhen she was around 40. That was enough life for her.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nSo, the last thing we did, very quickly,\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nis I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:16.958\n117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nwhich is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\none of the more sacred places in Bhutan.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nAnd up there, there are thousands of prayer flags\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nthat people have spread out over the years.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nAnd we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nand hung them up there among the prayer flags.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nAnd they're actually still flying up there today.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nSo if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nyou can go check these out. Here are some images from that.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nWe said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nYou can start to see some familiar balloons here.\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:02.958\n\"To make some money and to open a store\" was the Indian road worker.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nThanks very much.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A tour of modern architecture", "duration": "921", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/reed_kroloff_on_modern_and_romantic_architecture", "transcript": "To be new at TED \u2014 it's like being the last high-school virgin. (Laughter) You know that all of the cool people are \u2014 they're doing it. And you're on the outside, you're at home. You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water. And \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited. And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be. It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes. And you want to go back and do it again. But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism. And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about. You can talk about creationism \u2014 which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it \u2014 or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture \u2014 which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture \u2014 at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us? And our own opportunity to make something new there? This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time. I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns. These are just not things we talked about very often. And yet, now, it's talked about all the time. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings, you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this.How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that. There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover. They've made a selection. They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind, the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox, and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument, and now to an even larger instrument, upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic, as you see here. He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition, after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go, \"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up.\" Right. Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. Let's bring in some real architects for a change. And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.(Laughter)It's too late. That is gone. This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team, and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme. This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center: a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it. Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But that's what we're going to do. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents, and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything \u2014 that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical \u2014 or something that's more of a romantic solution.Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date. I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us. So, in the American tradition, the difference between the technocratic and the romantic, would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's Cartesian grids spreading across the United States, that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States, as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the \u2014 in Jefferson's time \u2014 current, popular philosophy of rationalism. Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny. Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny? Manifest destiny.(Laughter)It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important, it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male. And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day. We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we? Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one. And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.(Laughter)Why? Why? Why do you want to do that? Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.(Laughter)It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are. So we're going to go straight into this. Can I have the lights off for a moment? I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. One very young, one a little more mature. This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park. Does everybody know what a camera obscura is? Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world \u2014 it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts \u2014 and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building? No. It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down, square, rectangular, anything like that, that you'd see in a normal shape of a building. The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this. What's interesting about it is not the shape. What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made. A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron. What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again. That's why we all live in developer houses. They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times. That's because it's cheaper.Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts. The computer then talks to a machine \u2014 a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine \u2014 that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine. It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts. It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time. It's not a laborer \u2014 it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time. Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions, like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, \"Bolt A to B, and C to D.\" And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals. Just simple \"Bolt A to B\" and they will be able to put them together. Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works \u2014 and that's what will happen in the end.You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series. And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do? In the summer, you go to the beach. And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes. So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana. So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune. They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into \u2014 at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications \u2014 a set of instructions for pieces of wood. And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions. These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.What you can see is there's about six different colors, and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut. All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built. There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here. Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool. It's a great place for parties \u2014 it was, it was only up for six weeks. It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured. And they were able to do it. That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck. They were able to create that. They were able to create something wonderful. They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology. Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night. It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face. Here it is going across. And there, down the other side, and you get the same kind of grandeur.Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may. Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin. This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today. The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion. It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world \u2014 such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition. \"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,\" said the owner. Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white. Every single surface of this restaurant is white. The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming. Watch this \u2014 I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen. This is happening by itself. It transforms through the magic of lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch. Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco, up on the Upper West Side, with this wall of cliff divers who \u2014 there you go, like that. Let's see it one more time. Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before. It's about bringing nature to the inside.In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square \u2014 I'm sorry I'm rushing \u2014 where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself. It's about stimulation. This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste. Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater, look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. And I think I'll probably leave it at that.

And it's only taken five minutes.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd you want to go back and do it again.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nBut I really appreciate being here.

There it is. Looks like that.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nThere's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThey've made a selection.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThey've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthe enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nChild-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand now to an even larger instrument,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nupon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nas you see here.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHe was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nafter six previous firms struck out\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nwith things that were so stupid and banal\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat even the city of New York was forced to go,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nRight. Can we do this again from the top,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nexcept use some people with a vague hint of talent,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ninstead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nreal estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nLet's bring in some real architects for a change.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIt's too late. That is gone.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThis one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\na giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nNow, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nbecause what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nby making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nBut that's what we're going to do.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nBut I want you to think about these things\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nin terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand that these two things talk about very specifically.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nin trying to decide whether we want architecture\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nfrom the kind of technocratic solution to everything --\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthat there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbe they social, be they physical, be they chemical --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nor something that's more of a romantic solution.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nNow, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nI mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo, in the American tradition,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthe difference between the technocratic and the romantic,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwould be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nCartesian grids spreading across the United States,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthat gives us basically the whole shape\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nof every western state in the United States,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nas a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nin Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nOr the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nNow, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nManifest destiny.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nit sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nWe all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nEveryone here must own one, or at least they craved one\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthe moment they saw one.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nrather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWhy? Why? Why do you want to do that?\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWhy do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIt's in our nature to go ricocheting\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nback and forth between this technocratic solution\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo we're going to go straight into this.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nCan I have the lights off for a moment?\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthat represent the current split, architecturally,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nbetween these two traditions of a technocratic\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nor technological solution and a romantic solution.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nOne very young, one a little more mature.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThis is the work of a firm called SHoP,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nof what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nDoes everybody know what a camera obscura is?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nYeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat takes a picture of the outside world --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nit's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThis is just the outline of it, and you can see,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\ndoes it look like a regular building? No.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nsquare, rectangular, anything like that,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat you'd see in a normal shape of a building.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nThe computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\ntraditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWhat's interesting about it is not the shape.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWhat's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nA brand-new way to put buildings together,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nsomething called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhat makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nis making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThat's why we all live in developer houses.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThat's because it's cheaper.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nMass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\na program that says, manufacture these parts.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe computer then talks to a machine --\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\na computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthat can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nbecause the computer is just a machine.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nIt doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nIt doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nso the parts can all be cut at the same time.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nMeanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwhich are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nwhat the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nlike you used to get when you were a child,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhen you bought little models that said, \"Bolt A to B, and C to D.\"\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd so what the builder will get is every single individual part\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthat has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nto the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nJust simple \"Bolt A to B\" and they will be able to put them together.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nHere's the little drawing that tells them how that works --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand that's what will happen in the end.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nLest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthese same architects were asked to produce something\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nas part of their young architects summer series.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIn the summer, you go to the beach.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nSo they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThey took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand that computer program shaped a sand dune\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nat their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\na set of instructions for pieces of wood.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThese are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWhat you can see is there's about six different colors,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAll of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nonly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nOnly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand there it is fully built.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThere are only 16 different pieces of wood,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nonly 16 different assembly parts here.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nLooks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIt has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nIt's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhere lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nNow, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthis is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nreplacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthat very important pedestrian connection\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nbetween the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThey were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nbuilding it, including all of the parts, manufactured.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd they were able to do it. That was their design,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nusing that same computer modeling system\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand only five or six really different kinds of parts,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\na couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand a very simple framing system\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthat was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nThey were able to create that.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThey were able to create something wonderful.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThey're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nusing the same technology.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nHere we're going to walk across the bridge at night.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIt's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nso the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nHere it is going across. And there, down the other side,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand you get the same kind of grandeur.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nNow, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWoo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThis is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwhose work you can see out here today.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThe current king of the romantics, who approaches his work\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nin a very different fashion.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIt's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\ninto something that you can do, into something that will please you,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nsomething that will lift your spirits,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nsomething that will make you feel as if are in another world --\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nsuch as his Nobu restaurant in New York,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwhich is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nto the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\n\"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,\" said the owner.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nOr his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nI want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nEvery single surface of this restaurant is white.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThe reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nIt's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nWatch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThis is happening by itself.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIt transforms through the magic of lighting.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIt's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nRosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nup on the Upper West Side,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nwith this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nLet's see it one more time.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nOkay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nin places that you wouldn't have felt good before.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nIt's about bringing nature to the inside.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIn the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nI'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nto make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIt's about stimulation.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThis is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nFizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nall explained to you by color and texture on the wall.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nfor the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nwhere you're asked to enter the Greek theater,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nlook under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much."}, {"title": "The next 5,000 days of the web", "duration": "1174", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_on_the_next_5_000_days_of_the_web", "transcript": "The Internet, the Web as we know it, the kind of Web \u2014 the things we're all talking about \u2014 is already less than 5,000 days old. So all of the things that we've seen come about, starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth, which we couldn't even imagine happening before, all these things rolling into our lives, just this abundance of things that are right before us, sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop. This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed. It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. (Laughter) It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come. And I know that 10 years ago, if I had told you that this was all coming, you would have said that that's impossible. There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. And if I told you it was all coming for free, you would say, this is simply \u2014 you're dreaming. You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist. And yet it's here.The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago, as I looked at what even Wired was talking about, we thought it was going to be TV, but better. That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming. And it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning \u2014 if you think about, like, Wikipedia, it's something that was simply impossible. It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice. And if you take all these things that are impossible, I think one of the things that we're learning from this era, from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible, because we're unprepared for it.So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days. But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days, what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days? So, I have a kind of a simple story, and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making, this thing that has happened in 5,000 days \u2014 that's all these computers, all these handhelds, all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers \u2014 basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines, but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.And so I began to think about that. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours, the number of days. 5,000 days without interruption \u2014 that's just unbelievable. And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days; the Web is only 5,000 days. So, I was trying to basically make measurements. What are the dimensions of this machine? And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers. And there is a 100 billion clicks per day. And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions, and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer, talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless? Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell, but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet, if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. There's two million emails per second. So it's a very big number. It's just a huge machine, and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. So here's the specifications, just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it: 170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links, emails running at two megahertz itself, 31 kilohertz text messaging, 246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk. That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM. And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second. Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes. So every second, half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day, 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. So to a first approximation, we have these things \u2014 twenty petahertz synapse firings. Of course, the memory is really huge. But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size \u2014 and its complexity, kind of \u2014 to your brain. Because in fact, that's how your brain works \u2014 in kind of the same way that the Web works. However, your brain isn't doubling every two years. So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB, one human brain, if we look at the rate that this is increasing, 30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs. So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity,in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things. I have three kind of general things I would like to say, three consequences of this. First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next 5,000 days \u2014 we're going to give this machine a body. And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture. And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.So let me go through those three things. First of all, we have all these things in our hands. We think they're all separate devices, but in fact, every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. These are all basically portals into that one machine. The second thing is that \u2014 some people call this the cloud, and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook. And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. It's wireless. It's always connected. There's many things about it. It becomes very simple, and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine, you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. So the machine is computing.And in some ways, it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing. But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones, and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine. And everything will go through the Web. And we're seeing that already with, say, phones. Right now, phones don't go through the Web, but they are beginning to, and they will. And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah \u2014 all these things are going to become Web based. They're going through the machine. And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work, a Word document, they aren't on the Web, but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine. They're going to speak the Web language. They're going to talk to the machine. The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. And so every thing will be part of the Web. So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web-ness and connection, and it will be part of this machine, so that our environment \u2014 kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense \u2014 our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.Now, with RFIDs and other things \u2014 whatever technology it is, it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine, and so we have, basically, an Internet of things. So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels, and a car as a chip with wheels, because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials. A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied, alternative, virtual existence, and that we would have the old economy of atoms. But in fact, what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two, where we embed the information, and the digital nature of things into the material world. That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going \u2014 this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.And so one of the consequences of that, I believe, is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now \u2014 TV, film, video \u2014 that basically becomes one media platform. And while there's many differences in some senses, they will share more and more in common with each other. So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value, the value's in the uncopiable things, the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization. The media wants to be liquid. The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them, not so that they are \"free\" as in \"beer,\" but \"free\" as in \"freedom.\" And the network effects rule, meaning that the more you have, the more you get. The first fax machine \u2014 the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to. But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable. Those are the effects that we're going to see. Attention is the currency.So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal. McLuhan was saying, \"Machines are the extensions of the human senses.\" And I'm saying, \"Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine,\" in a certain sense. So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches, through all our digital photographs and cameras. And we see that in things like Flickr, or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.Now, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring, that what the Web is doing is restructuring. And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is \u2014 I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a \"semantic Web.\"So first of all, the first stage that we've seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers. And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets. And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world. And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors, and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it, you connected it from one computer to another computer. And what you had to do was \u2014 if you wanted to participate in this, you had to share packets of information. So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control. It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line: you had to share packets.The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages. So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page, I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer. Now we have pages \u2014 the unit has been resolved into pages, so one page links to another page. And if I want to go in to book a flight, I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline, and I'm linking to that page. And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links. You couldn't deny \u2014 if someone wanted to link to you, you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody. So that's what we were doing.We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about, and that is where we link the data. So, I don't know what the name of this thing is. I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data. So we're going from machine to machine, from page to page, and now data to data. So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page, we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea, rather than to the other page. So every idea is basically being supported \u2014 or every item, or every noun \u2014 is being supported by the entire Web. It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want. So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID. Every person, every item will have a something that will be very specific, and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. So now, in this new one, when I link to it, I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat. And so, giving an example of this thing, I live in Pacifica, rather than \u2014 right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town, and that it's a specific town that I live in, but that's what we're going to be talking about. It's going to link directly to \u2014 it will know, the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place, and that whenever it sees that word, \"Pacifica,\" it knows that it actually has a place, latitude, longitude, a certain population.So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things, that you'll see a lot more of. All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. So I'll give you one kind of an example. There's like a billion social sites on the Web. Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once, and it should know who all your friends are. So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified, and you should just carry these relationships around. All this data about you should just be conveyed, and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data. That's what we're moving into \u2014 where it sort of knows these things down to that level. A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph \u2014 we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page, or your computer. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages, they are things. Everything we've described, every artifact or place, will be a specific representation, will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. So we have this database of things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to, that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days, but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things \u2014 where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane \u2014 that that physical thing becomes part of the Web. And so we are in the middle of this thing that's completely linked, down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has.So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent. It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better. If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history. And I found out by looking at it that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning. So I am open, and being transparent to that. And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency. That is going to be the price. If you want to have total personalization, you have to be totally transparent. Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things \u2014 I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. And we kind of object at first, saying, \"Oh, that's awful.\" But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology, called the alphabet, and writing, we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture. We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there. And what is happening with this is some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI, as being an expert, Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do, and that's what they're trying to do. But when six billion humans are Googling, who's searching who? It goes both ways. So we are the Web, that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better. Just like it wasn't TV and only better. The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better \u2014 it's going to be something different. And I think it's going to be smarter. It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious. But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense. Secondly, it's become much more personalized. It will know us, and that's good. And again, the price of that will be transparency. And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it. And all these devices will be portals into that.So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just \"the Web, only better,\" but a new kind of stage in this development. It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts. But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism. So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system, more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a \"One.\" And I don't know what else to call it, than the One. We'll have a better word for it. But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge. And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness, I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria, or a volvox, which is what that organism is.So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say: there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS. All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web. To share is to gain. Let the One read it. It's going to be machine-readable. You want to make something that the machine can read. And the One is us. We are in the One. I appreciate your time.

You're a wild-eyed optimist.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd yet it's here.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThe other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nas I looked at what even Wired was talking about,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwe thought it was going to be TV, but better.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThat was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nwas going to be coming.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd it turns out that that's not what it was.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nFirst of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd so one of the things that I think we're learning --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nif you think about, like, Wikipedia,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nit's something that was simply impossible.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd if you take all these things that are impossible,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI think one of the things that we're learning from this era,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nfrom this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbecause we're unprepared for it.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nSo, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBut if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhat's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nSo, I have a kind of a simple story,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthis thing that has happened in 5,000 days --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nthat's all these computers, all these handhelds,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nall these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbasically what we're getting out of all these connections\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nis we're getting one machine.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIf there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nare actually just little windows into those machines,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nbut that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd so I began to think about that.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd it turned out that this machine happens to be\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nthe most reliable machine that we've ever made.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIt has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd there's almost no other machine that we've ever made\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthat runs the number of hours, the number of days.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthe Web is only 5,000 days.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo, I was trying to basically make measurements.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWhat are the dimensions of this machine?\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nall around the globe on all the computers.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd there is a 100 billion clicks per day.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\ntalking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWell, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nbut there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nif you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThere's two million emails per second.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo it's a very big number.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt's just a huge machine,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo here's the specifications,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\njust as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\n170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nemails running at two megahertz itself,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n31 kilohertz text messaging,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\n246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThat's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd the total traffic on this\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nis running at seven terabytes per second.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBrewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo every second, half of the Library of Congress\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nis swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nSo I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n55 trillion links is almost the same\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nas the number of synapses in your brain.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nA quadrillion transistors is almost the same\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nas the number of neurons in your brain.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo to a first approximation, we have these things --\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\ntwenty petahertz synapse firings.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nOf course, the memory is really huge.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nBut to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBecause in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nHowever, your brain isn't doubling every two years.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo if we say this machine right now that we've made\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nis about one HB, one human brain,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nif we look at the rate that this is increasing,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nwill exceed a total processing power of humanity,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nin raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nRay Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nI have three kind of general things\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nI would like to say, three consequences of this.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nFirst, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWe're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nin the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo let me go through those three things.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nFirst of all, we have all these things in our hands.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nWe think they're all separate devices,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nbut in fact, every screen in the world\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nis looking into the one machine.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThese are all basically portals into that one machine.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThe second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand you're kind of touching the cloud with this.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt's wireless. It's always connected.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThere's many things about it. It becomes very simple,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nyou're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo the machine is computing.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd in some ways, it's sort of back\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nto the kind of old idea of centralized computing.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand the sensors in cars\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand everything is connected to this machine.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd everything will go through the Web.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd we're seeing that already with, say, phones.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nRight now, phones don't go through the Web,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nbut they are beginning to, and they will.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nin terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nall these things are going to become Web based.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThey're going through the machine.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nRight now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\na Word document, they aren't on the Web,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nbut they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThey're going to speak the Web language.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThey're going to talk to the machine.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThe Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat's sucking up everything into it.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd so every thing will be part of the Web.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nsome little sliver of Web-ness and connection,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand it will be part of this machine,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nso that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nour environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow, with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nit doesn't really matter. The point is that everything\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwill have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand so we have, basically, an Internet of things.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand a car as a chip with wheels,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbecause basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nis the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nA lot of people think about the new economy\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nas something that was going to be a disembodied,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nalternative, virtual existence,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand that we would have the old economy of atoms.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nBut in fact, what the new economy really is\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand the digital nature of things into the material world.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThat's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthis union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd so one of the consequences of that, I believe,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nis that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nTV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd while there's many differences in some senses,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthey will share more and more in common with each other.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthe value's in the uncopiable things,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThe media wants to be liquid.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThe reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nnot so that they are \"free\" as in \"beer,\" but \"free\" as in \"freedom.\"\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd the network effects rule,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nmeaning that the more you have, the more you get.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThe first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nwas an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut here she became an evangelist, recruiting others\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nto get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nThose are the effects that we're going to see.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAttention is the currency.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd the other thing about this embodiment\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nis that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nMcLuhan was saying, \"Machines are the extensions of the human senses.\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd I'm saying, \"Humans are now going to be\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthe extended senses of the machine,\" in a certain sense.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSo we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthrough all our digital photographs and cameras.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd we see that in things like Flickr,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nor Photosynth, this program from Microsoft\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthat will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nfrom the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIn a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nNow, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthat what the Web is doing is restructuring.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nI'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a \"semantic Web.\"\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nSo first of all, the first stage that we've seen\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nof the Internet was that it was going to link computers.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nand there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nyou connected it from one computer to another computer.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nyou had to share packets of information.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSo you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIt wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nyou had to share packets.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThe second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nNow we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nso one page links to another page.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd if I want to go in to book a flight,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand I'm linking to that page.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nYou couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nyou couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nof opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo that's what we were doing.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nWe're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nand that is where we link the data.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo, I don't know what the name of this thing is.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nI'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nSo we're going from machine to machine,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nfrom page to page, and now data to data.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nSo the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwe're actually going to link from one idea on a page\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nto another idea, rather than to the other page.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo every idea is basically being supported --\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nor every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nIt's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo besides physically coming out again into this idea\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthat it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nSo something will resolve down to the information\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nabout a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nEvery person, every item will have a something\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthat will be very specific, and will link\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nto a specific representation of that idea or item.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSo now, in this new one, when I link to it,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nI would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd so, giving an example of this thing,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nI live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nThe Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand that it's a specific town that I live in,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nbut that's what we're going to be talking about.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIt's going to link directly to --\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nit will know, the Web will be able to read itself\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand know that that actually is a place,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand that whenever it sees that word, \"Pacifica,\"\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nit knows that it actually has a place,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nlatitude, longitude, a certain population.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat you'll see a lot more of.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nAll these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo I'll give you one kind of an example.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThere's like a billion social sites on the Web.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nEach time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand all your friends are.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nWhy should you be doing that? You should just do that once,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand it should know who all your friends are.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nand you should just carry these relationships around.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAll this data about you should just be conveyed,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand you should do it once and that's all that should happen.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd you should have all the networks\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nof all the relationships between those pieces of data.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThat's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nA semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwe're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nBut what's it's doing is sharing data.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthan just sharing your Web page, or your computer.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd all these things that are going to be on this\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nare not just pages, they are things.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nEverything we've described, every artifact or place,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwill be a specific representation,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwill have a specific character that can be linked to directly.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nSo we have this database of things.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthat we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nbut I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhere I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat that physical thing becomes part of the Web.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd so we are in the middle of this thing\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthat's completely linked, down to every object\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nin the little sliver of a connection that it has.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat we're going to be codependent.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nIt's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nIf you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nAnd I found out by looking at it\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthat I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nSo I am open, and being transparent to that.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThat is going to be the price.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nIf you want to have total personalization,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nyou have to be totally transparent.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nGoogle. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nWe're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nwhere I don't even try to remember things --\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nI'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd we kind of object at first, saying, \"Oh, that's awful.\"\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nBut if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\ncalled the alphabet, and writing,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nwe're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nWe cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nAnd so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nwithout this other machine being there.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAnd what is happening with this is\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nsome kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nas being an expert, Larry Page told me\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthat that's what they're trying to do,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nand that's what they're trying to do.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nBut when six billion humans are Googling,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nwho's searching who? It goes both ways.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nSo we are the Web, that's what this thing is.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nWe are going to be the machine.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nSo the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nJust like it wasn't TV and only better.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThe next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nbut only better -- it's going to be something different.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nAnd I think it's going to be smarter.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nIt'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nBut it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nSecondly, it's become much more personalized.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nIt will know us, and that's good.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd again, the price of that will be transparency.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAnd thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nin terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nAnd all these devices will be portals into that.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nSo the single idea that I wanted to leave with you\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nis that we have to begin to think about this as not just \"the Web, only better,\"\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nbut a new kind of stage in this development.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nIt looks more global. If you take this whole thing,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nit is a very big machine, very reliable machine,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nmore reliable than its parts.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nBut we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nSo we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nmore as if this wasn't a large organism\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nthat we are going to be interacting with. It's a \"One.\"\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nAnd I don't know what else to call it, than the One.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nWe'll have a better word for it.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nBut there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nAnd again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nI want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nor a volvox, which is what that organism is.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nSo, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say:\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nthere's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nAll screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nTo share is to gain. Let the One read it.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nIt's going to be machine-readable.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nYou want to make something that the machine can read.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nAnd the One is us. We are in the One.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nI appreciate your time.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A computer that works like the brain", "duration": "982", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kwabena_boahen_on_a_computer_that_works_like_the_brain", "transcript": "I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra, and it was a really cool device. You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC. And I was fascinated. So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work. I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory, the RAM and the ALU, the arithmetic and logic unit. And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system.But nobody was really worried about this. When computers were first introduced, they were said to be a million times faster than neurons. People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain. This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing: \"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person.\" This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true. And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now, is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers. Let's take a look at some numbers. This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world. It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process 10 quadrillion bits of information per second. That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power. So that would be really great, if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania. It would really boost the economy. Just to go back to the States, if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the States, you get 1,200 households in the U.S. That's how much power this computer uses.Now, let's compare this with the brain. This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain. Rory is a graduate student at Stanford. He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned. (Laughter) So that's true love, right there. Now, how much computation does the brain do? I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second, which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does. So that's the question. The question is, how much \u2014 they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data \u2014 the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use? And it's actually as much as your laptop computer: it's just 10 watts. So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses, the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency? And let me just summarize. So the bottom line: the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. How is the brain able to do this? Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. So, this clip is from the PBS series, \"The Secret Life of the Brain.\" It shows you these cells that process information. They are called neurons. They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other, and where they contact each other, those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other. That process is called a synapse. You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other \u2014 about 100 million of them, sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.How does that compare with the way computers work? In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. It's really a network in the literal sense of the word. The net is doing the work in the brain. If you just look at these two pictures, these kind of words pop into your mind. This is serial and it's rigid \u2014 it's like cars on a freeway, everything has to happen in lockstep \u2014 whereas this is parallel and it's fluid. Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive.So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno: \"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.\" (Laughter) Brian actually said this in 1995. And nobody was listening then, but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face. And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.This is \u2014 it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers, and the devices that our brains use to compute. The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor. This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current from the source to the drain \u2014 these two electrodes. And that current, electrical current, is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on. And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate, you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current. And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device. Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one, and the absence of current to represent a zero.Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller, they no longer behave like this. In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute, which is called an ion channel. And this is a little protein molecule. I mean, neurons have thousands of these. And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it. And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore. Now, this pore can open and close. But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady \u2014 it's a sporadic flow of current. And even when you close the pore \u2014 which neurons can do, they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity \u2014 even when it's closed, because these ions are so small, they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time. So, what you have is that when the pore is open, you get some current sometimes. These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in. And when it's closed, you have a zero, but you have a few ones thrown in.Now, this is starting to happen in transistors. And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 \u2014 the technology that we are using \u2014 a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side. In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way. And that means that a transistor corresponds to about 12 ion channels in parallel. Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much. This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip. Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them \u2014 before, it was 256. Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen, and technology has really benefitted from that.But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small, that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel, and that corresponds to a single ion channel. And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel. The current will turn on and off at random, even when it's supposed to be on. And that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.So, we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices. And the only kind of thing \u2014 the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.OK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory, it sends it into the processor or the ALU, and then it puts the result back into memory. That's the red path that's highlighted. The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons. And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern.What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered, it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections. So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up, there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information. It makes the brain inherently robust. What you have here is a system where you store data locally. And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless, otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.What I want to basically talk about is my dream, which is to build a computer that works like the brain. This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years. And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina, which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball. We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer. In fact, the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. They want to compress the information \u2014 they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on \u2014 and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain.Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms, we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina. And they figured out all the different cells, and they figured out the network, and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip. So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip, and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors. And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain. It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like. The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here. And the chip \u2014 I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul, who's the student who designed this chip. Let me explain what you're going to see, OK, because it's putting out different kinds of information, it's not as straightforward as a camera. The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information. It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red. And it extracts regions with white or light contrast, which will show up on the video as green.This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here. And then it also extracts movement. When Kareem moves his head to the right, you will see this blue activity there; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image, that's where it's going from dark to light. And you also see this yellow activity, which represents regions where contrast is decreasing; it's going from light to dark. And these four types of information \u2014 your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it, and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information. So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right? It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background, only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.But the point that I want to make \u2014 I'll show you up here. So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. And so, here you go. Yes, so that's the idea. When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts. But when it's moving back and forth, the retina picks up these changes. And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here and something happens in your background, you merely move your eyes to it. There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it. So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you.Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano, OK. This is a steel drum here that has been modified, and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano. And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer, and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that. Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena. Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing, the future of Africa, this conference \u2014 what connections can we make, if any, between them?Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning, I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra. And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it. It was very brute force; it was very inelegant. I don't think that I would've had that reaction, if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction, hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just \u2014 you know, buying into this hype about computers. I was coming at it from a different perspective, where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective, and I think that's going to impact technology. And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve. And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion, to come up with new things, because you're coming from a different perspective. I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.CA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 320, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand it was a really cool device.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nYou could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd I was fascinated.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nSo I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nI read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nbetween the memory, the RAM and the ALU,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthe arithmetic and logic unit.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\njust to keep all this data moving through the system.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nBut nobody was really worried about this.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nWhen computers were first introduced,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthey were said to be a million times faster than neurons.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nPeople were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthe capacity of the brain.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nThis is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\n\"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nas to ask a person.\"\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nThis was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nthis kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWhat people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nis that we pay a huge price for the speed\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthat we claim is a big advantage of these computers.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nLet's take a look at some numbers.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nThis is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n10 quadrillion bits of information per second.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThat's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo that would be really great, if you could add that\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto the production capacity in Tanzania.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nIt would really boost the economy.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nJust to go back to the States,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nif you translate the amount of power or electricity\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthis computer uses to the amount of households in the States,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nyou get 1,200 households in the U.S.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThat's how much power this computer uses.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nNow, let's compare this with the brain.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThis is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nRory is a graduate student at Stanford.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nHe studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nthis is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nSo that's true love, right there.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, how much computation does the brain do?\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nI estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwhich is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nSo that's the question. The question is, how much --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthey are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthe question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd it's actually as much as your laptop computer:\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nit's just 10 watts.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo what we are doing right now with computers\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwith the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthe brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd let me just summarize. So the bottom line:\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthe brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthan we do right now with this computer technology that we have.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nHow is the brain able to do this?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nLet's just take a look about how the brain works,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand then I'll compare that with how computers work.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo, this clip is from the PBS series, \"The Secret Life of the Brain.\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nIt shows you these cells that process information.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThey are called neurons.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThey send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand where they contact each other, those little pulses\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nof electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThat process is called a synapse.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nYou've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nabout 100 million of them,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nsending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nHow does that compare with the way computers work?\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nIn the computer, you have all the data\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ngoing through the central processing unit,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwhereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand the data just really flows through a network of connections\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\namong the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt's really a network in the literal sense of the word.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThe net is doing the work in the brain.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nIf you just look at these two pictures,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthese kind of words pop into your mind.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThis is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\neverything has to happen in lockstep --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhereas this is parallel and it's fluid.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nInformation processing is very dynamic and adaptive.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n\"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.\"\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBrian actually said this in 1995.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd nobody was listening then,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbut now people are beginning to listen\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nbecause there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThis is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbetween the devices that we use to compute in computers,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand the devices that our brains use to compute.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThe devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThis electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nfrom the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd that current, electrical current,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nis carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nyou get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nYour computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand the absence of current to represent a zero.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthey no longer behave like this.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIn fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhich is called an ion channel.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd this is a little protein molecule.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nI mean, neurons have thousands of these.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd these are individual potassium ions\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat are flowing through that pore.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nNow, this pore can open and close.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut, when it's open, because these ions have to line up\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit's a sporadic flow of current.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthey can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\neven when it's closed, because these ions are so small,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthey can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo, what you have is that when the pore is open,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nyou get some current sometimes.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThese are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd when it's closed, you have a zero,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nbut you have a few ones thrown in.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nNow, this is starting to happen in transistors.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthe technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIn fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd that means that a transistor corresponds\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nto about 12 ion channels in parallel.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nThis is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nOr your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nof stuff on them -- before, it was 256.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nTransistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand technology has really benefitted from that.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nBut what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthat it corresponds to only one electron at a time\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\ncan flow through that channel,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand that corresponds to a single ion channel.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThe current will turn on and off at random,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\neven when it's supposed to be on.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd that means your computer is going to get\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nits ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nSo, we are at the stage where we\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\ndon't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthat can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nOK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit sends it into the processor or the ALU,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand then it puts the result back into memory.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThat's the red path that's highlighted.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd the way they represent information is\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthey break up that data into little pieces\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat are represented by pulses and different neurons.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nSo you have all these pieces of data\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\ndistributed throughout the network.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd then the way that you process that data to get a result\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nis that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\njust by it flowing through the network.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nSo you set up these connections\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nsuch that the input pattern just flows\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nand generates the output pattern.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nWhat you see here is that there's these redundant connections.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nit doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwith these redundant connections.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nSo even when you go to these crappy devices\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nwhere sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthere's redundancy in the network\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat can actually recover the missing information.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nIt makes the brain inherently robust.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWhat you have here is a system where you store data locally.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\notherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthat stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nWhat I want to basically talk about is my dream,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhich is to build a computer that works like the brain.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThis is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd I'm going to show you a system that we designed\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto model the retina,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nwhich is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIn fact, the processing that happens\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nin that little piece of brain is very similar\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto the kind of processing that computers\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\ndo when they stream video over the Internet.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nThey want to compress the information --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthey just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand that is how your eyeball\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nis able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nto send to the rest of the brain.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nInstead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwe went and talked to neurobiologists\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwho have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd they figured out all the different cells,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand they figured out the network, and we just took that network\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd these transistors are behaving essentially\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\njust like ion channels behave in the brain.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nHere is actually what our artificial eye looks like.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThe retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd the chip -- I'm going to show you a video\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat the silicon retina put out of its output\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwhen it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nwho's the student who designed this chip.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nLet me explain what you're going to see, OK,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nbecause it's putting out different kinds of information,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nit's not as straightforward as a camera.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThe retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nIt extracts regions with dark contrast,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nwhich will show up on the video as red.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd it extracts regions with white or light contrast,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nwhich will show up on the video as green.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThis is Kareem's dark eyes\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand that's the white background that you see here.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd then it also extracts movement.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWhen Kareem moves his head to the right,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nyou will see this blue activity there;\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nit represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat's where it's going from dark to light.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd you also see this yellow activity,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhich represents regions where contrast is decreasing;\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nit's going from light to dark.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd these four types of information --\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nyour optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand 900,000 of those fibers\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nsend these four types of information.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSo we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nWhat you notice here is that these snapshots\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\ntaken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nIt doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nonly on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd this is the same thing you see\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwhen people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nbecause that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthat are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo this image here is going to look like these ones,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nbut here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nso, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd so, here you go.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nYes, so that's the idea.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nWhen you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nBut when it's moving back and forth,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthe retina picks up these changes.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd that's why, you know, when you're sitting here\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand something happens in your background,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nyou merely move your eyes to it.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nThere are these cells that detect change\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand you move your attention to it.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo those are very important for catching somebody\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwho's trying to sneak up on you.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nLet me just end by saying that this is what happens\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwhen you put Africa in a piano, OK.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nThis is a steel drum here that has been modified,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nand that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand come up with a new kind of computer\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nChris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nDo you put together in your mind the work you're doing,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe future of Africa, this conference --\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nwhat connections can we make, if any, between them?\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nKwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nI got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nIt was very brute force; it was very inelegant.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nI don't think that I would've had that reaction,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nif I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nhearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nbuying into this hype about computers.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI was coming at it from a different perspective,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhere I was bringing that different perspective\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto bear on the problem.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand I think that's going to impact technology.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nAnd that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nAnd I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nto come up with new things,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbecause you're coming from a different perspective.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI think we can contribute.

It ties to origami. So let me start. What is origami? Most people think they know what origami is. It's this: flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing. And that is what origami used to be. But it's become something else. It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.The common theme \u2014 what makes it origami \u2014 is folding is how we create the form. You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797. It shows these women playing with these toys. If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane. Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane. So this art has been around for hundreds of years, and you would think something that's been around that long \u2014 so restrictive, folding only \u2014 everything that could be done has been done a long time ago. And that might have been the case.But in the twentieth century, a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along, and he created tens of thousands of new designs. But even more importantly, he created a language, a way we could communicate, a code of dots, dashes and arrows. Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk, we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection, and we know where that leads. And where it has led in origami is to things like this. This is an origami figure \u2014 one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds. This, too, is origami, and this shows where we've gone in the modern world. Naturalism. Detail. You can get horns, antlers \u2014 even, if you look close, cloven hooves.And it raises a question: what changed? And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art, which is math. That is, people applied mathematical principles to the art, to discover the underlying laws. And that leads to a very powerful tool. The secret to productivity in so many fields \u2014 and in origami \u2014 is letting dead people do your work for you.(Laughter)Because what you can do is take your problem, and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved, and use their solutions. And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. Origami revolves around crease patterns. The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure. And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. They have to obey four simple laws. And they're very simple, easy to understand. The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. The directions of the folds at any vertex \u2014 the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds \u2014 always differs by two. Two more or two less. Nothing else. If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line, all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line. And if you look at how the layers stack, you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets, a sheet can never penetrate a fold. So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami. All of origami comes from that.And you'd think, \"Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity?\" But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin, and yet they govern all of chemistry, all of life, all of history. If we obey these laws, we can do amazing things. So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns \u2014 like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures \u2014 and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different. This fish, 400 scales \u2014 again, it is one uncut square, only folding. And if you don't want to fold 400 scales, you can back off and just do a few things, and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes. Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag, with 13 stripes. And if you want to go really crazy, 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake. And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance.The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures. And I can put it in this simple equation. We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.(Laughter)What matters is what we mean by those symbols. And you might say, \"Can you really be that specific? I mean, a stag beetle \u2014 it's got two points for jaws, it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?\" And yeah, you really can. So how do we do that? Well, we break it down into a few smaller steps. So let me stretch out that equation. I start with my idea. I abstract it. What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure. And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject, a flap for every leg. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape.Now the first step, pretty easy. Take an idea, draw a stick figure. The last step is not so hard, but that middle step \u2014 going from the abstract description to the folded shape \u2014 that's hard. But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. But we're going to start small. This base has a lot of flaps in it. We're going to learn how to make one flap. How would you make a single flap? Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap. I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.What paper went into that flap? Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over. I can use it for something else. Well, there are other ways of making a flap. There are other dimensions for flaps. If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper. If I make the flap as skinny as possible, I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed. And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap. There's other ways of making flaps. If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper. And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle. So, no matter how I make a flap, it needs some part of a circular region of paper. So now we're ready to scale up. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps? What do I need? I need a lot of circles.And in the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. And here's where the dead people start to help us out, because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles. I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements. And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes. So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. You get a folded shape \u2014 in this case, a cockroach. And it's so simple.(Laughter)It's so simple that a computer could do it. And you say, \"Well, you know, how simple is that?\" But computers \u2014 you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this, we could. So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website. It's free. It runs on all the major platforms \u2014 even Windows.(Laughter)And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern. It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed \u2014 which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers \u2014 you'll get this crease pattern. And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines, you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer, with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. And if you want a different deer, not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk, you change the packing, and you can do an elk. Or you could do a moose. Or, really, any other kind of deer. These techniques revolutionized this art. We found we could do insects, spiders, which are close, things with legs, things with legs and wings, things with legs and antennae. And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough, then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square. She's eating him. I call it \"Snack Time.\"And you can do more than just insects. This \u2014 you can put details, toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. This tree frog has toes. Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models. Toes have become an origami meme, because everyone's doing it. You can make multiple subjects. So these are a couple of instrumentalists. The guitar player from a single square, the bass player from a single square. And if you say, \"Well, but the guitar, bass \u2014 that's not so hot. Do a little more complicated instrument.\" Well, then you could do an organ.(Laughter)And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand. So now people can say, \"I want exactly this and this and this,\" and you can go out and fold it. And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. But I want to show you some examples. Everything you'll see here, except the car, is origami.(Video)(Applause)Just to show you, this really was folded paper. Computers made things move, but these were all real, folded objects that we made. And we can use this not just for visuals, but it turns out to be useful even in the real world. Surprisingly, origami and the structures that we've developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine, in science, in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.And I want to show you some of these examples. One of the earliest was this pattern, this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer. He studied a folding pattern, and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure. And he used it to design this solar array. It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995. Now, there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple. The telescope, going up in space, it unfolds in two places. It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern \u2014 you wouldn't even call that origami. They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami. Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger. They called it the Eyeglass. The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25,000 miles up, 100-meter diameter lens. So, imagine a lens the size of a football field. There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists, who want to look up, and then other people, who wanted to look down. Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket. And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller. How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller? Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow. So you have to do something like this. This was a small model.Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures. But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters. So the Livermore engineers, wanting to make use of the work of dead people, or perhaps live origamists, said, \"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.\" So they looked into the origami community, we got in touch with them, and I started working with them. And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size, but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder. And they adopted that for their first generation, which was not 100 meters \u2014 it was a five-meter. But this is a five-meter telescope \u2014 has about a quarter-mile focal length. And it works perfectly on its test range, and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.Now, there is other origami in space. Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail, and you can see here that the sail expands out, and you can still see the fold lines. The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination, but needs to be small for the journey. And that works whether you're going into space, or whether you're just going into a body. And this example is the latter. This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University. It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination, but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there, through your blood vessels. And this stent folds down using an origami pattern, based on a model called the water bomb base.Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. And they want to do their design by simulation. So they need to figure out how, in a computer, to flatten an airbag. And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation. And so they can do a simulation like this. Those are the origami creases forming, and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out, does it work? And that leads to a really interesting idea.You know, where did these things come from? Well, the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school. It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base. The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects \u2014 things with legs. The thing is, that this often happens in math and science. When you get math involved, problems that you solve for aesthetic value only, or to create something beautiful, turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world. And as weird and surprising as it may sound, origami may someday even save a life.

So let me start.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nWhat is origami?\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nMost people think they know what origami is. It's this:\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nflapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd that is what origami used to be.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBut it's become something else.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nIt's become an art form, a form of sculpture.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nThe common theme -- what makes it origami --\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nis folding is how we create the form.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nYou know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nIt shows these women playing with these toys.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIf you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nEvery Japanese kid\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nlearns how to fold that crane.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nSo this art has been around for hundreds of years,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand you would think something\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthat's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\neverything that could be done has been done a long time ago.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAnd that might have been the case.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nBut in the twentieth century,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\na Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand he created tens of thousands of new designs.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBut even more importantly, he created a language,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\na way we could communicate,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\na code of dots, dashes and arrows.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nHarkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwe now have a means of transmitting information\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nwith heredity and selection,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand we know where that leads.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd where it has led in origami\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nis to things like this.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nThis is an origami figure --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\none sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nThis, too, is origami,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand this shows where we've gone in the modern world.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nNaturalism. Detail.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nYou can get horns, antlers --\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\neven, if you look close, cloven hooves.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd it raises a question: what changed?\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd what changed is something\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nyou might not have expected in an art,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhich is math.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThat is, people applied mathematical principles\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nto the art,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nto discover the underlying laws.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd that leads to a very powerful tool.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThe secret to productivity in so many fields --\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand in origami --\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nis letting dead people do your work for you.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBecause what you can do is\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\ntake your problem,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand use their solutions.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAnd I want to tell you how we did that in origami.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nOrigami revolves around crease patterns.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThe crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nfor an origami figure.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd you can't just draw them arbitrarily.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThey have to obey four simple laws.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd they're very simple, easy to understand.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwith just two colors without ever having\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthe same color meeting.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThe directions of the folds at any vertex --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthe number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nalways differs by two. Two more or two less.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nNothing else.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIf you look at the angles around the fold,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nyou find that if you number the angles in a circle,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nall the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nall the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAnd if you look at how the layers stack,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nyou'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\na sheet can never\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\npenetrate a fold.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nSo that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAll of origami comes from that.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd you'd think, \"Can four simple laws\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\ngive rise to that kind of complexity?\"\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBut indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\ncan be written down on a napkin,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand yet they govern all of chemistry,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nall of life, all of history.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIf we obey these laws,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwe can do amazing things.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nSo in origami, to obey these laws,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe can take simple patterns --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nlike this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand by itself it's nothing.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nBut if we follow the laws of origami,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nwe can put these patterns into another fold\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat itself might be something very, very simple,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nbut when we put it together,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nwe get something a little different.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThis fish, 400 scales --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nagain, it is one uncut square, only folding.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd if you don't want to fold 400 scales,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nyou can back off and just do a few things,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOr you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\non a flag, with 13 stripes.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd if you want to go really crazy,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\n1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this guy's on display downstairs,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nso take a look if you get a chance.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThe most powerful tools in origami\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nhave related to how we get parts of creatures.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I can put it in this simple equation.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nWe take an idea,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ncombine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nWhat matters is what we mean by those symbols.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd you might say, \"Can you really be that specific?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nI mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nit's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?\"\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd yeah, you really can.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo how do we do that? Well, we break it down\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\ninto a few smaller steps.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nSo let me stretch out that equation.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI start with my idea. I abstract it.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWhat's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat has a part for every bit of the subject,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\na flap for every leg.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nyou can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nyou can turn it into the finished shape.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow the first step, pretty easy.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nTake an idea, draw a stick figure.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThe last step is not so hard, but that middle step --\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\ngoing from the abstract description to the folded shape --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat's hard.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut that's the place where the mathematical ideas\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\ncan get us over the hump.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd I'm going to show you all how to do that\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nso you can go out of here and fold something.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nBut we're going to start small.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThis base has a lot of flaps in it.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWe're going to learn how to make one flap.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nHow would you make a single flap?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nTake a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nuntil it gets long and narrow,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nWhat paper went into that flap?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nWell, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nyou can see that the upper left corner of that shape\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nis the paper that went into the flap.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nSo that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nI can use it for something else.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWell, there are other ways of making a flap.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThere are other dimensions for flaps.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nIf I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIf I make the flap as skinny as possible,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nI get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThere's other ways of making flaps.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIf I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, no matter how I make a flap,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nit needs some part\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nof a circular region of paper.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo now we're ready to scale up.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWhat do I need? I need a lot of circles.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd in the 1990s,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\norigami artists discovered these principles\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\njust by packing circles.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd here's where the dead people start to help us out,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nbecause lots of people have studied\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthe problem of packing circles.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nI can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nlooking at disc packings and arrangements.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nyou decorate the patterns of circles with lines\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\naccording to more rules. That gives you the folds.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThose folds fold into a base. You shape the base.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nYou get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd it's so simple.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt's so simple that a computer could do it.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd you say, \"Well, you know, how simple is that?\"\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut computers -- you need to be able to describe things\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nin very basic terms, and with this, we could.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\ncalled TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nIt's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd you just draw a stick figure,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand it calculates the crease pattern.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nIt does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand if you use that stick figure that I just showed --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwhich you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nyou'll get this crease pattern.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nyou'll get a base that you can then shape\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ninto a deer,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwith exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd if you want a different deer,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nnot a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nyou change the packing,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand you can do an elk.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nOr you could do a moose.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nOr, really, any other kind of deer.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nThese techniques revolutionized this art.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWe found we could do insects,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nspiders, which are close,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthings with legs, things with legs and wings,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nthings with legs and antennae.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwasn't interesting enough,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nthen you could do two praying mantises\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nfrom a single uncut square.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nShe's eating him.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nI call it \"Snack Time.\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd you can do more than just insects.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThis -- you can put details,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\ntoes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThis tree frog has toes.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nActually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nToes have become an origami meme,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nbecause everyone's doing it.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nYou can make multiple subjects.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo these are a couple of instrumentalists.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThe guitar player from a single square,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthe bass player from a single square.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd if you say, \"Well, but the guitar, bass --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthat's not so hot.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nDo a little more complicated instrument.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWell, then you could do an organ.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd what this has allowed is the creation\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nof origami-on-demand.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo now people can say, \"I want exactly this and this and this,\"\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand you can go out and fold it.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nAnd sometimes you create high art,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut I want to show you some examples.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nEverything you'll see here,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nexcept the car, is origami.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Video)\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nJust to show you, this really was folded paper.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nComputers made things move,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nbut these were all real, folded objects that we made.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd we can use this not just for visuals,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbut it turns out to be useful even in the real world.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nSurprisingly, origami\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand the structures that we've developed in origami\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nturn out to have applications in medicine, in science,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nin space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nAnd I want to show you some of these examples.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nOne of the earliest was this pattern,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthis folded pattern,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nstudied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nHe studied a folding pattern, and realized\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthis could fold down into an extremely compact package\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat had a very simple opening and closing structure.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd he used it to design this solar array.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nIt's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nin 1995.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow, there is actually a little origami\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nin the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThe telescope, going up in space,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nit unfolds in two places.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIt folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nyou wouldn't even call that origami.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nThey certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut if you want to go higher and go larger than this,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nthen you might need some origami.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nEngineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nhad an idea for a telescope much larger.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThey called it the Eyeglass.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThe design called for geosynchronous orbit\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n25,000 miles up,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n100-meter diameter lens.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, imagine a lens the size of a football field.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThere were two groups of people who were interested in this:\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nplanetary scientists, who want to look up,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand then other people, who wanted to look down.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nWhether you look up or look down,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhow do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nHow do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWell, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo you have to do something like this.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThis was a small model.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nFolded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nBut this pattern's not going to work\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto get something 100 meters down to a few meters.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSo the Livermore engineers,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwanting to make use of the work of dead people,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nor perhaps live origamists, said,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n\"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.\"\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nSo they looked into the origami community,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwe got in touch with them, and I started working with them.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd we developed a pattern together\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthat scales to arbitrarily large size,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbut that allows any flat ring or disc\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nto fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd they adopted that for their first generation,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhich was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBut this is a five-meter telescope --\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nhas about a quarter-mile focal length.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it works perfectly on its test range,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nNow, there is other origami in space.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nJapan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand you can see here that the sail expands out,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand you can still see the fold lines.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThe problem that's being solved here is\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nsomething that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nbut needs to be small for the journey.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd that works whether you're going into space,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nor whether you're just going into a body.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd this example is the latter.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThis is a heart stent developed by Zhong You\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nat Oxford University.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nIt holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nbut it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nthrough your blood vessels.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd this stent folds down using an origami pattern,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nbased on a model called the water bomb base.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAirbag designers also have the problem\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nof getting flat sheets\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\ninto a small space.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd they want to do their design by simulation.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo they need to figure out how, in a computer,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nto flatten an airbag.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd the algorithms that we developed\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nto do insects\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nturned out to be the solution for airbags\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nto do their simulation.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd so they can do a simulation like this.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThose are the origami creases forming,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand now you can see the airbag inflate\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand find out, does it work?\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd that leads\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto a really interesting idea.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nYou know, where did these things come from?\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWell, the heart stent\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ncame from that little blow-up box\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat you might have learned in elementary school.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThe airbag-flattening algorithm\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\ncame from all the developments\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nof circle packing and the mathematical theory\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthat was really developed\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\njust to create insects -- things with legs.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThe thing is, that this often happens\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin math and science.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nWhen you get math involved, problems that you solve\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nfor aesthetic value only,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nor to create something beautiful,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nturn around and turn out\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto have an application in the real world.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nAnd as weird and surprising as it may sound,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\norigami may someday even save a life.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nThanks.\n\n00:15:45.958 -->

For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators, such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road, to study things on the smallest scale. But more recently, I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected. So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe, what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are \u2014 at least some of the big questions.So, recently, we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe \u2014 and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me, the planets, the stars, the galaxies \u2014 the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible. By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, which is what we use to detect things. It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there? We know it's there by its gravitational effects. In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.What about the rest of the pie? The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. More about that later, OK. So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter. In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this, most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy. This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy. So we have these stars going around in circles like this. As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK \u2014 that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK.So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside. In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance \u2014 this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK \u2014 we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy. When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance. If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter. And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves, and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy. So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space; they tend to cluster. And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster. And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster. They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here. So these galaxy clusters \u2014 we take a snapshot now, we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical. But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds. They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK. So all of these galaxies are moving. We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities, and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well. But that cannot account for the mass either. In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter, OK. It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there. Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.And so let me lead you through how we can do this. So here's an observer: it could be an eye; it could be a telescope. And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe. How do we see that galaxy? A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye. Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is? Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye, right? We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies \u2014 and don't forget the dark matter, OK. Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass, will deflect not only the trajectory of particles, but will deflect light itself.So this light ray will not continue in a straight line, but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye. Where will this observer see the galaxy? You can respond. Up, right? We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here. Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy? Yes, great. I see people going down like this. So a ray of light could go down, be bent up into the observer's eye, and the observer sees a ray of light here.Now, take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe, OK, a three-dimensional space. Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye? Yes! The rays would lie on a \u2014 I'd like to see \u2014 yeah, on a cone. So there's a whole ray of light \u2014 rays of light on a cone \u2014 that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see? A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK. Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line. If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK, to figure out what that image will look like. Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise, that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect. We call this gravitational lensing. And so, this is your instrument, OK. (Laughter). But ignore the top part. It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK. So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop. We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK. So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing. And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper \u2014 I'm a physicist. (Laughter) So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle. And now put the lens over the galaxy, and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring. Now, move the base off to the side, and the ring will split up into arcs, OK. And you can put it on top of any image. On the graph paper, you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted. And again, this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing.OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky? Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies? And the answer is yes. And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies \u2014 those are the galaxies in the cluster. They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically, of the background galaxies. So the streaks that you see, all these streaks, are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster. And it's an enormous amount of mass. And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this, that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies. They are centered on some more spread out structure, and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded, OK. So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter \u2014 this gravitationally attracting stuff \u2014 is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy. So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. And that is the fact that space itself is expanding. So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe \u2014 and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK \u2014 and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures, so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure, horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are. If you could do this, what you would find that with each passing day, each passing year, each passing billions of years, OK, the distance between galaxies is getting greater. And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. They're not necessarily moving through space. They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger, OK. That's what the expansion of the universe or space means. So they're moving further apart.Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate. But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space, it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK. So the expansion slows down with time. So, in the last century, OK, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again. So a little over a decade ago, two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down, OK. By how much less is it expanding today, compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments, was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago, OK. So the expansion of space is actually speeding up. This was a completely surprising result. There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK. No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found. It was the opposite of what was expected. So we need something to be able to explain that. Now it turns out, in the mathematics, you can put it in as a term that's an energy, but it's a completely different type of energy from anything we've ever seen before. We call it dark energy, and it has this effect of causing space to expand. But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point, OK. So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe, and they have very different effects. Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts, it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK. So clusters of galaxies will tend to form, because of all this gravitational attraction. Dark energy, on the other hand, is putting more and more space between the galaxies, makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease, and so it impedes the growth of structure. So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies, and how they \u2014 their number density, how many there are as a function of time \u2014 we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming.In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any, you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy. Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes. We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter. Now, what do I mean by well motivated? I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK, things that I haven't even talked about, that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting, new particle.So, this is exactly what you want in physics: where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else. But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate, OK. One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different. Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door. They just pass through anything. They can come through the building, through the Earth \u2014 they're so non-interacting.So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it. So a crystal that will ring if that happens. So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector. And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota, OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far. They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy, to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this. The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator, that we'll be turning on later this year. It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider.Now, because they are so non-interactive, they will actually escape the detector, so their signature will be missing energy, OK. Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy, so it will be hard to tell the difference. And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy \u2014 ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. So in terms of the big questions: what is dark matter? What is dark energy? The big questions facing physics. And I'm sure you have lots of questions, which I very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

later, OK.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nIn these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nmost of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nThis huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo we have these stars going around in circles like this.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAs you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthan those that are further out here, OK.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nSo what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nIn other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthis is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwe would expect that it goes down as the distance increases\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nfrom the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWhen those measurements are made,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\ninstead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nas a function of distance.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nIf it's constant, that means that the stars out here\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nIn fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nappears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nSo we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nGalaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nthey tend to cluster.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThey're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nwe take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBut these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThey're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nSo all of these galaxies are moving.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWe can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand figure out how much mass is in this cluster.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd again, what we find is that there is much more mass there\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthan can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nOr if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwe see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBut that cannot account for the mass either.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nIn fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nin the form of this invisible or dark matter\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas there is in the ordinary matter, OK.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nto try to remind you that it's there.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nCan we see it more visually? Yes, we can.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd so let me lead you through how we can do this.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo here's an observer:\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit could be an eye; it could be a telescope.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nHow do we see that galaxy?\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nA ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfor perhaps billions of years\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbefore it enters the telescope or your eye.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nNow, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nWell, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nas it enters our eye, right?\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nWe say, the ray of light came this way;\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthe galaxy must be there, OK.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nNow, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand don't forget the dark matter, OK.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNow, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwe now need to take into account\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nwhat Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nwill deflect not only the trajectory of particles,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut will deflect light itself.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo this light ray will not continue in a straight line,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbut would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWhere will this observer see the galaxy?\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nYou can respond. Up, right?\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nWe extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIs there any other ray of light\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nYes, great. I see people going down like this.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo a ray of light could go down, be bent\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nup into the observer's eye,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand the observer sees a ray of light here.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNow, take into account the fact that we live in\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\na three-dimensional universe, OK,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\na three-dimensional space.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAre there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nYes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat will all be bent by that cluster\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand make it into the observer's eye.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nIf there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nA circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nNow, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIf they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nNow, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto figure out what that image will look like.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nBecause it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWe call this gravitational lensing.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd so, this is your instrument, OK.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nBut ignore the top part.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nIt's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWe shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nSo it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd so the next thing you need to do in your experiment\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nis grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd now put the lens over the galaxy,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow, move the base off to the side,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand the ring will split up into arcs, OK.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd you can put it on top of any image.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nOn the graph paper, you can see\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nhow all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd again, this is a kind of an accurate model\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nof what happens with the gravitational lensing.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nOK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nDo we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nMany of the images you are seeing\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nare earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nWell, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthose are the galaxies in the cluster.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nThey're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat are causing the bending of the light\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nto cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nof the background galaxies.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo the streaks that you see, all these streaks,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nare actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwe see in those images, we can calculate how much mass\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthere must be in this cluster.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd it's an enormous amount of mass.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThey are centered on some more spread out structure,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand that is the dark matter\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nin which the cluster is embedded, OK.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nSo this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nat least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nOK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nSo the evidence that we have\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthat a quarter of the universe is dark matter --\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthis gravitationally attracting stuff --\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit must be embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthat say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nOK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd that is the fact that space itself is expanding.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nso every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nhorizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIf you could do this, what you would find\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthat with each passing day, each passing year,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\neach passing billions of years, OK,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthe distance between galaxies is getting greater.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd it's not because galaxies are moving\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\naway from each other through space.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThey're not necessarily moving through space.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nThey're moving away from each other\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nbecause space itself is getting bigger, OK.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThat's what the expansion of the universe or space means.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo they're moving further apart.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nNow, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nis that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nBut because gravitationally attracting matter\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nis embedded in this space,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nit tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo the expansion slows down with time.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo, in the last century, OK, people debated\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nabout whether this expansion of space would continue forever;\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwhether it would slow down, you know,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nwill be slowing down, but continue forever;\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nslow down and stop, asymptotically stop;\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nor slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nSo a little over a decade ago,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.958\ntwo groups of physicists and astronomers\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nset out to measure the rate at which\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthe expansion of space was slowing down, OK.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nBy how much less is it expanding today,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\ncompared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nwas that space is expanding at a faster rate today\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthan it was a few billion years ago, OK.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nSo the expansion of space is actually speeding up.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThis was a completely surprising result.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThere is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nNo one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nIt was the opposite of what was expected.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nSo we need something to be able to explain that.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nNow it turns out, in the mathematics,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nyou can put it in as a term that's an energy,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nbut it's a completely different type of energy\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nfrom anything we've ever seen before.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nWe call it dark energy,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand it has this effect of causing space to expand.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nBut we don't have a good motivation\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nfor putting it in there at this point, OK.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSo it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nNow, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nis that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nare completely different things, OK.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThere are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand they have very different effects.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nDark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nit tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nSo clusters of galaxies will tend to form,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nbecause of all this gravitational attraction.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nDark energy, on the other hand,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nis putting more and more space between the galaxies,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nmakes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand so it impedes the growth of structure.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand how they -- their number density,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nhow many there are as a function of time --\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwe can learn about how dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\ncompete against each other in structure forming.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIn terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nyou know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nDo we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWe have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nNow, what do I mean by well motivated?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI mean that we have mathematically consistent theories\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthat were actually introduced\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nto explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nthings that I haven't even talked about,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat each predict the existence\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nof a very weakly interacting, new particle.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo, this is exactly what you want in physics:\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhere a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat was actually developed for something else.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nBut we don't know if either of those\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nare actually the dark matter candidate, OK.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nOne or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nNow, we look for these dark matter particles\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbecause, after all, they are here in the room, OK,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand they didn't come in the door.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThey just pass through anything.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThey can come through the building, through the Earth --\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthey're so non-interacting.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo one way to look for them is to build detectors\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nthat are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo a crystal that will ring if that happens.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nhave built such a detector.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nOK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nannounced the most sensitive results so far.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThey haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nand the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThere's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nto see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nThe Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthat we'll be turning on later this year.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt is possible that dark matter particles might be produced\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nat the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nNow, because they are so non-interactive,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthey will actually escape the detector,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nso their signature will be missing energy, OK.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nNow, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwhose signature could be missing energy,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nso it will be hard to tell the difference.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAnd finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nspecifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthat are in competition right now\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nto be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSo in terms of the big questions:\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nwhat is dark matter? What is dark energy?\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThe big questions facing physics.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nAnd I'm sure you have lots of questions,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nwhich I very much look forward to addressing\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nover the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A family tree for humanity", "duration": "1253", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/spencer_wells_is_building_a_family_tree_for_all_humanity", "transcript": "Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks, as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing, checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on. And visiting some pretty incredible places, places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice \u2014 I was here a month ago.And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons. You see some incredible stuff. And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe. And the thing that you really take away from that, the kind of surface thing that you take away from it, is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that, but rather how different we are. There is so much diversity around the globe. 6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes. You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that, and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.How do we explain that diversity? Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took. Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions \u2014 how do you explain something like that \u2014 can be broken down into sub-questions. And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.First one is really a question of origins. Do we all share a common origin, in fact? And given that we do \u2014 and that's the assumption everybody, I think, in this room would make \u2014 when was that? When did we originate as a species? How long have we been divergent from each other?And the second question is related, but slightly different. If we do spring from a common source, how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe, and in the process generate all of this diversity, the different ways of life, the different appearances, the different languages around the world?Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology, seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago. In \"The Descent of Man,\" he wrote, \"In each great region of the world, the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.\"So we're done, we can go home \u2014 finished the origin question. Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes. And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent. Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record. Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time, due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean. Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago, and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it. The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia, became the gibbons and the orangutans. And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us. So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes, it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.But that's not really the question I'm asking. I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry? Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back \u2014 over a billion years. What we're asking about though is human ancestry. How do we study that?Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. Digging things up out of the ground, and largely on the basis of morphology \u2014 the way things are shaped, often skull shape \u2014 saying, \"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor. This must be who I'm directly descended from.\"The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue, gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry, but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists. What do I mean by that? You're looking at a great example here. These are three extinct species of hominids, potential human ancestors. All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family. And they're all dating to roughly the same time. From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Australopithecus \u2014 now called Paranthropus boisei, the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time. That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. Which one of these guys am I actually related to? Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently \u2014 again, largely skull shape. The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. You think you've got a tough job? And he did a pretty good job. He categorized about 12,000 species in \"Systema Naturae.\" He actually coined the term Homo sapiens \u2014 it means wise man in Latin. But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, \"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.\" And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans, and a blatantly racist category he termed \"Monstrosus,\" which basically included all the people he didn't like, including imaginary folk like elves.It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era. Except, if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity. Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago \u2014 Carlton Coon is the best example \u2014 had been diverging from each other \u2014 this was in the post-Darwinian era \u2014 for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus. But based on what data? Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.Well, what I'm going to talk about today, what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem. Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry, digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors, and saying it on the basis of morphology \u2014 which we still don't completely understand, we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation \u2014what we need to do is turn the problem on its head. Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem, or a genealogical question. What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today. And as any genealogist will tell you \u2014 anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time? You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about. You and your siblings, you have a parent in common. You and your cousins share a grandparent in common. You gradually trace further and further back into the past, adding these ever more distant relationships. But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records, and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall. A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors, and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.Who were these people who came before? We have no written record. Well, actually, we do. Written in our DNA, in our genetic code \u2014 we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.Now, a quick primer on DNA. I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist. It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint. It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them. And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint. How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length. A haploid genome \u2014 we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes \u2014 a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length. And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long. If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long. If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body, and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back, thousands of times. It's a lot of information.And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job. Imagine the longest book you can think of, \"War and Peace.\" Now multiply it by 100. And imagine copying that by hand. And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake \u2014 substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations. It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in. But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down through the generations, they become markers of descent. If you share a marker with someone, it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past, the person who first had that change in their DNA. And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation, the pattern of these markers in people all over the world, and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history, that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work. Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent. You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother, all the way back to the very first woman. The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent. Everybody in this room, everybody in the world, falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees. Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them. Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up. What's the take-home message?Well, the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa, among Africans. That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer. And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA. Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa. And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.Now, how recently do we share this ancestry? Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world? No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear. Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person \u2014 Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her \u2014 in Africa, an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago. That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time. This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world. It's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world. Such an amazing story. We're all effectively part of an extended African family.Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier? Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species, or sub-species rather, human races around the world? Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently? Well, that's a big question. These \"why\" questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones, the ones that are tough to answer.And so when all else fails, talk about the weather. What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago? Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago. It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago. Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on. We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets. New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice. Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet \u2014 about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn \u2014 and there aren't a lot of glaciers here, except on the high mountains here in East Africa. So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa. Rather, Africa was drying out at that time. This is a paleo-climatological map of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before. The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere. If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.So the whole world was drying out. The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now. And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today. The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago, crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals. We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.And then something happened. A great illustration of it. Look at some stone tools. The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago. The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins, not our direct ancestors, living in Europe, and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago. Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience, basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups. The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right. We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The tool styles don't change that much. The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period.But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance. The stone tools become much more finely crafted. The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species, at particular times of the year. The population size started to expand. Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language, syntactic language \u2014 subject, verb, object \u2014 that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded.This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. Well, you want the ultimate African success story? Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa \u2014 probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now, around 60, 70 thousand years ago \u2014 allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago. A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savannah hunters.So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. And it's basically a meat locker. People who would have specialized in killing the animals, hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up, following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago, during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara. Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on.And when they reached Central Asia, they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway, a grassland super-highway. The grasslands at that time \u2014 this was during the last ice age \u2014 stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea, and the entire continent was open to them. Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age \u2014 temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps \u2014 migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species. And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book, \"The Journey of Man,\" and a film that we made with the same title. And as we were finishing up that film \u2014 it was co-produced with National Geographic \u2014 I started talking to the folks at NG about this work. And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, \"You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level. What do you want to do next?\" Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.And I said, \"Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that. It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet. And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from, you know, a handful of populations around the world. Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map. We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more \u2014 hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.\"And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project. The project launched in April 2005. It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it. The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples. People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost. So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling. Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up. But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.That's the focus of the field research, the centers that we've set up all over the world \u2014 10 of them, top population geneticists. But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world. How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project? The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.In this case, you actually can. You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic. You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA. And you can actually submit those results to the database, and tell us a little about your genealogical background, have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise, after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components, gets plowed back into the project. The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund. It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational, cultural projects initiated by them. They apply to this fund in order to do various projects, and I'll show you a couple of examples.So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world. The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars. Projects around the world \u2014 documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone, preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza, language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc. So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.Thank you very much.

Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nour common ancestry with apes.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAround 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAfrica was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\ndue to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbecame the gibbons and the orangutans.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nAnd the ones that stayed on in Africa\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nevolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nSo, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nit's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nBut that's not really the question I'm asking.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI'm asking about our human ancestry,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthings that we would recognize as being like us\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nif they were sitting here in the room.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIf they were peering over your shoulder,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nyou wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nBecause if we go far enough back,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nwe share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nDNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nWhat we're asking about though is human ancestry.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nHow do we study that?\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWell, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nDigging things up out of the ground,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand largely on the basis of morphology --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthe way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\n\"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis must be who I'm directly descended from.\"\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThe field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\ngives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nbut it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nYou're looking at a great example here.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThese are three extinct species of hominids,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\npotential human ancestors.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAll dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd they're all dating to roughly the same time.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nFrom left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthe robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThat means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nWhich one of these guys am I actually related to?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nPossibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWell, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nusing the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nagain, largely skull shape.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThe first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nCarl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nwho in the eighteenth century took it upon himself\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto categorize every living organism on the planet.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nYou think you've got a tough job?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd he did a pretty good job.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nHe categorized about 12,000 species in \"Systema Naturae.\"\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nHe actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nBut looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\n\"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.\"\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand a blatantly racist category he termed \"Monstrosus,\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nwhich basically included all the people he didn't like,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nincluding imaginary folk like elves.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nbut ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nworking in the pre-Darwinian era.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nExcept, if you had taken physical anthropology\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nas recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nbasically that same classification of humanity.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nHuman races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nCarlton Coon is the best example --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nhad been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nfor over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nBut based on what data?\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nVery little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWell, what I'm going to talk about today,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nwhat I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nInstead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\ndigging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand saying it on the basis of morphology --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwhich we still don't completely understand,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwe don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nwhat we need to do is turn the problem on its head.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nBecause what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nor a genealogical question.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd as any genealogist will tell you --\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nanybody have a member of the family, or maybe you\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nhave tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nYou start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nYou and your siblings, you have a parent in common.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nYou and your cousins share a grandparent in common.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nYou gradually trace further and further back into the past,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nadding these ever more distant relationships.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBut eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nA point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nWho were these people who came before?\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWe have no written record. Well, actually, we do.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nWritten in our DNA, in our genetic code --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwe have a historical document that takes us back in time\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nNow, a quick primer on DNA.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nI suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nIt is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nof how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nIt's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nHow long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nA haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\na haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd the whole thing, if you add it all together,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nis over six billion nucleotides long.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nIf you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthousands of times. It's a lot of information.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nImagine the longest book you can think of, \"War and Peace.\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nNow multiply it by 100.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd imagine copying that by hand.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd you're working away until late at night,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand you're paying attention, but, occasionally,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhen you're copying this by hand,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nyou're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nsubstitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSame thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthrough the generations, they become markers of descent.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIf you share a marker with someone,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nit means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthe person who first had that change in their DNA.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe pattern of these markers in people all over the world,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthat we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nThese are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nMitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nYou get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nall the way back to the very first woman.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThe Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\ntraces a purely paternal line of descent.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nEverybody in this room, everybody in the world,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nfalls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNow, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthey're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nTurn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwith the root at the bottom and the branches going up.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nWhat's the take-home message?\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWell, the thing that jumps out at you first\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nis that the deepest lineages in our family trees\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nare found within Africa, among Africans.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nThat means that Africans have been accumulating\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthis mutational diversity for longer.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nEvery piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nleft the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nNow, how recently do we share this ancestry?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWas it millions of years ago, which we might suspect\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nby looking at all this incredible variation around the world?\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nNo, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nWithin the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nMitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nan African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nBut what's even more amazing\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nis that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthe male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nonly lived around 60,000 years ago.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nThat's only about 2,000 human generations,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthe blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nThat tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThis was an African man who gave rise\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nto all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nIt's only within the last 60,000 years\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nthat we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSuch an amazing story.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nWe're all effectively part of an extended African family.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nWhy didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nor sub-species rather, human races around the world?\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nWhy was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nWell, that's a big question. These \"why\" questions,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nparticularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthe ones that are tough to answer.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd so when all else fails, talk about the weather.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWhat was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nWell, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nIt went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nLots of evidence from sediment cores\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nbut basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:47.958\ngetting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nNew York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nMost of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nNow, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nabout 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand there aren't a lot of glaciers here,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nexcept on the high mountains here in East Africa.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nSo what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nRather, Africa was drying out at that time.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThis is a paleo-climatological map\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nof what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nreconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThe reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIf you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nSo the whole world was drying out.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThe sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThe Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\ncompared to what we have today.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nThe evidence from genetic data\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\ncrashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nWe nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd then something happened. A great illustration of it.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nLook at some stone tools.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThe ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThe ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nnot our direct ancestors, living in Europe,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nNow, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nor physical anthropologists in the audience,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nbasically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThe ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nWe are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nuntil around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nThe tool styles don't change that much.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThe evidence is that the human way of life\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\ndidn't change that much during that period.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nBut then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nall hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThe stone tools become much more finely crafted.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThe evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nat particular times of the year.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nThe population size started to expand.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nProbably, according to what many linguists believe,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nfully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthat we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nWe became much more social. The social networks expanded.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThis change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand they allowed us to start to expand around the world.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWe've been talking at this conference about African success stories.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nWell, you want the ultimate African success story?\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nLook in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nis because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nprobably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\naround 60, 70 thousand years ago --\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nallowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAn early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nleaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nreaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nA slightly later migration up into the Middle East.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nThese would have been savannah hunters.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nSo those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nyou'll get to see what a real savannah is like.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnd it's basically a meat locker.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nPeople who would have specialized in killing the animals,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nhunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nfollowing the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nduring one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nMigrating eastward, following the grasslands,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nbecause that's what they were adapted to live on.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnd when they reached Central Asia,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthey reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\na grassland super-highway.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nThe grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nstretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand the entire continent was open to them.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nEntering Europe around 35,000 years ago,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand finally, a small group migrating up\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nthrough the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\ninside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\ntemperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nmigrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAn amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nThe changes that allowed us to do that,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nthe evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nallowing us to create novel cultures,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nallowing us to develop the diversity\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nthat we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nNow, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nof how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nAnd that's the story that I told a couple of years ago\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nin my book, \"The Journey of Man,\" and a film that we made with the same title.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd as we were finishing up that film --\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nit was co-produced with National Geographic --\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI started talking to the folks at NG about this work.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nAnd they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n\"You know, we really see this as kind of\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nthe next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nusing the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nYou know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nand we want to take it to the next level.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nWhat do you want to do next?\"\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nWhich is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nIt is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nyou know, a handful of populations around the world.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nStudied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nWe've just connected the dots. What we need to do\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nis increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nhundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.\"\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nAnd that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nThe project launched in April 2005.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nIt has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThe field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nPeople who have lived in the same location for a long period of time\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nretain a connection to the place where they live\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nthat many of the rest of us have lost.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nSo my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nI live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nWhere am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nBut there are people who retain that link to their ancestors\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nthat allows us to contextualize the DNA results.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nThat's the focus of the field research,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nthe centers that we've set up all over the world --\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\n10 of them, top population geneticists.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nBut, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nHow often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nThe Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nIn this case, you actually can.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nYou can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nYou can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nAnd you can actually submit those results to the database,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nand tell us a little about your genealogical background,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nhave the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nNow, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nafter we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\ngets plowed back into the project.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nThe majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nIt's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nthat gives money back to indigenous groups around the world\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nfor educational, cultural projects initiated by them.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nThey apply to this fund in order to do various projects,\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nand I'll show you a couple of examples.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nSo how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\ncollected from indigenous people around the world.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nThe most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.958\n210,000 people have ordered these participation kits\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nsince we launched two years ago,\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nwhich has raised around five million dollars,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nthe majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nWe've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nProjects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:27.958\npreserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nlanguage revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nSo the project is going very, very well,\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nand I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How photography connects us", "duration": "893", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_griffin_on_how_photography_connects", "transcript": "Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. This is an icon of National Geographic, an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry. But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic, and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph. Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale. He mounted a camera on the tail. A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell. Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson. I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer. A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen. Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth \u2014 they're not very good swimmers \u2014 and we know what's happening to the ice. These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa, photographed by Chris Johns. Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels. This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard, a great portraitist. And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection, photographed by Nick Nichols. This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey. And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor. But, hey, at least it's hygienic. (Laughter) These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance, by David Doubilet. And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason. And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars, photographed by Emory Kristof. Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world, because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment.Here's an example. Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son, and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches. But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty. I can stand here right now and see, as I go tearing into the water after him, the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement. I can see the rocks are over here. There's a wave about to crash onto him. I can see his hands reaching out, and I can see his face in terror, looking at me, saying, \"Help me, Dad.\" I got him. The wave broke over us. We got back on shore; he was fine. We were a little bit rattled. But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it. And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.Now I have to tell you, I was talking to Kyle last week about this, that I was going to tell this story. And he said, \"Oh, yeah, I remember that too! I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me.\" (Laughter) I thought I was a hero. (Laughter)So, this represents \u2014 this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists, working at the very top of their craft \u2014 except one. This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year, and it was submitted and published in National Geographic. Last year, we added a section to our website called \"Your Shot,\" where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication. And it has become a wild success, tapping into the enthusiast photography community. The quality of these amateur photographs can, at times, be amazing. And seeing this reinforces, for me, that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them.But to be a great photojournalist, you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you. You've got to be able to make them all the time. But even more importantly, you need to know how to create a visual narrative. You need to know how to tell a story. So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad, called Zakouma. The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species, of an exotic locale. And that is what Nick did, up to a point. This is a serval cat. He's actually taking his own picture, shot with what's called a camera trap. There's an infrared beam that's going across, and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph. These are baboons at a watering hole. Nick \u2014 the camera, again, an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this. And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. (Laughter) A lion having a late night snack \u2014 notice he's got a broken tooth. And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail.But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants. It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa. Here's a photograph shot in moonlight, something that digital photography has made a big difference for. It was with the elephants that this story pivoted. Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay, collared the matriarch of the herd. They named her Annie, and they began tracking her movements. The herd was safe within the confines of the park, because of this dedicated group of park rangers. But once the annual rains began, the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.And that's when they ran into trouble. For outside the safety of the park were poachers, who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks. The matriarch that they were radio tracking, after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park, came to a halt outside the park. Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd. And they only came for the ivory. This is actually one of the rangers. They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory, because they couldn't leave it there, because it's still valuable. But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight, \"Isn't this an amazing world?\" And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply. Instead of just knowledge of this park, he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts.Now let's go over to India. Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way. We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. For the first time in history, more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments. And most of that growth is not in the cities, but in the slums that surround them. Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer, came to me and said, \"We need to document this, and here's my proposal. Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.\" And I said, \"Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.\" So instead, what we did was we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story \u2014 where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything \u2014 we put Jonas into Dharavi, which is part of Mumbai, India, and let him stay there, and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. By staying tightly focused in one place, Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community. And he did it in a beautiful way.Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture. We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries. We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject, but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing. Here, in a photo by Brian, a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja. I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch, the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species. But here, Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard. And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never-before-made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.Back on land, Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa, where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals, the main parts having already been sent to Europe. And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market. As prime food sources are depleted, the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein. This is called fishing down the food chain.But there are also glimmers of hope, and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this, we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. We also want to look for solutions. Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand, where commercial fishing had been banned \u2014 the result being that the overfished species have been restored, and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial. James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED, took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq. It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home, on the other. Jim started in the battlefield. Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital. Here is in the field hospital. The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home. From here, the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany, where they meet up with their families for the first time. And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals, such as here in Walter Reed. And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis, they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives. Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.Now, these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics. But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it, just plain fun. Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals. They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean. In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed. So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins. You know of \"The March of the Penguins.\" This is sort of the munch of the penguins. (Laughter) Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.But then Paul got in the water. And he said he was never really afraid of this. Well, this one female came up to him. She's probably \u2014 it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph, but she's 12 feet long. So, she is pretty significant in size. And Paul said he was never really afraid, because she was more curious about him than threatened. This mouthing behavior, on the right, was really her way of saying to him, \"Hey, look how big I am!\" Or you know, \"My, what big teeth you have.\" (Laughter) Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins. So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him, alive, and put them in front of him. She dropped them off, and then they would swim away. She'd kind of look at him, like \"What are you doing?\" Go back and get them, and then bring them back and drop them in front of him. And she did this over the course of a couple of days, until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head. (Laughter) Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph. (Laughter) Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive. This is her just puffing out, you know, snorting out in disgust. (Laughter) And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature, and came back with not just a collection of photographs, but an amazing experience and a great story. It is these kinds of stories, ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism. I believe that photography can make a real connection to people, and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today. Thank you.

The wave broke over us.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWe got back on shore; he was fine.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWe were a little bit rattled.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut this flashbulb memory, as it's called,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nis when all the elements came together to define\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nnot just the event, but my emotional connection to it.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd this is what a photograph taps into\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nwhen it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nNow I have to tell you,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI was talking to Kyle last week about this,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat I was going to tell this story.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd he said, \"Oh, yeah, I remember that too!\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI remember my image of you\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwas that you were up on the shore yelling at me.\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI thought I was a hero.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nSo,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthis represents -- this is a cross-sample of\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nsome remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nworking at the very top of their craft --\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nexcept one.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThis photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nin New Zealand last year,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nand it was submitted and published in National Geographic.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nLast year, we added a section to our website called \"Your Shot,\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwhere anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd it has become a wild success,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\ntapping into the enthusiast photography community.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThe quality of these amateur photographs\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\ncan, at times, be amazing.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd seeing this reinforces, for me,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat every one of us has at least one or two\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\ngreat photographs in them.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBut to be a great photojournalist,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nyou have to have more than just one or two\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\ngreat photographs in you.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nYou've got to be able to make them all the time.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nBut even more importantly,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nyou need to know how to create a visual narrative.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nYou need to know how to tell a story.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo I'm going to share with you some coverages\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthat I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nPhotographer Nick Nichols went to document\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\na very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nin Chad, called Zakouma.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe original intent was to travel there\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand bring back a classic story of diverse species,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nof an exotic locale.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd that is what Nick did, up to a point.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThis is a serval cat.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nHe's actually taking his own picture,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nshot with what's called a camera trap.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThere's an infrared beam that's going across,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThese are baboons at a watering hole.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nNick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\ntook thousands of pictures of this.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd Nick ended up with a lot of pictures\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nof the rear ends of baboons.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nA lion having a late night snack --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nnotice he's got a broken tooth.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI love this little bit of water\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthat comes off the back of his tail.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nBut the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nIt's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nHere's a photograph shot in moonlight,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nsomething that digital photography has made a big difference for.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt was with the elephants that this story pivoted.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nNick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\ncollared the matriarch of the herd.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nThey named her Annie,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nand they began tracking her movements.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThe herd was safe within the confines of the park,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbecause of this dedicated group of park rangers.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nBut once the annual rains began,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthe herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd that's when they ran into trouble.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nFor outside the safety of the park were poachers,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nwho would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThe matriarch that they were radio tracking,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nafter weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\ncame to a halt outside the park.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnnie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd they only came for the ivory.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThis is actually one of the rangers.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThey were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nbecause they couldn't leave it there,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbecause it's still valuable.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nBut what Nick did was he brought back\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\na story that went beyond the old-school method\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nof just straight, \"Isn't this an amazing world?\"\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nInstead of just knowledge of this park,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nhe created an understanding and an empathy\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nfor the elephants, the rangers and the many issues\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nsurrounding human-wildlife conflicts.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nNow let's go over to India.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWe were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\ntouches upon in his new world population project.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nFor the first time in history,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nmore people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd most of that growth is not in the cities,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nbut in the slums that surround them.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nJonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ncame to me and said,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\n\"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nLet's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.\"\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.\"\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo instead, what we did was\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwe decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin what we'd consider sort of a survey story --\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwhere you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwe put Jonas into Dharavi,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwhich is part of Mumbai, India,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand let him stay there, and really get into\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe heart and soul of this really major part of the city.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhat Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nat the awful conditions that exist in such places.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nHe saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nof how the entire urban area functioned.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nBy staying tightly focused in one place,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nJonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthat underlies this community.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd he did it in a beautiful way.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWe teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand photojournalist Randy Olson\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nto document the depletion of the world's fisheries.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nWe weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nbut the photographs that Brian and Randy created\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare among the best to capture both the human\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand natural devastation of overfishing.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nHere, in a photo by Brian,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\na seemingly crucified shark is caught up\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nin a gill net off of Baja.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nI've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthe animals accidentally scooped up\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhile fishing for a specific species.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBut here, Brian captured a unique view\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nby positioning himself underneath the boat\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhen they threw the waste overboard.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd Brian then went on to even greater risk\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto get this never-before-made photograph\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nof a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBack on land, Randy Olson photographed\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\na makeshift fish market in Africa,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwhere the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthe main parts having already been sent to Europe.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAs prime food sources are depleted,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthe harvest goes deeper into the oceans\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand brings in more such sources of protein.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThis is called fishing down the food chain.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nBut there are also glimmers of hope,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwe don't really want to go\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nand just look at all the problems.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nWe also want to look for solutions.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBrian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwhere commercial fishing had been banned --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe result being that the overfished species have been restored,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nPhotography can also compel us to confront\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nissues that are potentially distressing and controversial.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nJames Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\ntook a look at the sweep of the medical system\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthat is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nIt is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand exits back home, on the other.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nJim started in the battlefield.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nHere, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\non the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nHere is in the field hospital.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe soldier on the right has the name of his daughter\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\ntattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nFrom here, the more severely wounded are transported\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nback to Germany, where they meet up with their families\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nfor the first time.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nsuch as here in Walter Reed.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nthey exit the medical system and attempt\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nto regain their pre-war lives.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nJim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nand gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow, these stories are great examples\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof how photography can be used\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto address some of our most important topics.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nBut there are also times when photographers\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nsimply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\njust plain fun.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nPhotographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nto shoot a story on leopard seals.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThey have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\none of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nIn fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ngrabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSo you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nabout getting into the water.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nNow, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nYou know of \"The March of the Penguins.\"\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThis is sort of the munch of the penguins.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHere a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nto see if the coast is clear.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nBut then Paul got in the water.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd he said he was never really afraid of this.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nWell, this one female came up to him.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nShe's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nbut she's 12 feet long.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, she is pretty significant in size.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd Paul said he was never really afraid,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbecause she was more curious about him than threatened.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThis mouthing behavior, on the right,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwas really her way of saying to him, \"Hey, look how big I am!\"\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nOr you know, \"My, what big teeth you have.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThen Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nTo her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nthat for some reason didn't seem to be interested\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nin chasing penguins.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nSo what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nalive, and put them in front of him.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nShe dropped them off, and then they would swim away.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nShe'd kind of look at him, like \"What are you doing?\"\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nGo back and get them, and then bring them back\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand drop them in front of him.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd she did this over the course of a couple of days,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nuntil the point where she got so frustrated with him\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat she started putting them directly on top of his head.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWhich just resulted in a fantastic photograph.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nEventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthat he was never going to survive.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThis is her just puffing out, you know,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nsnorting out in disgust.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nPaul set out to photograph a relatively\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nmysterious and unknown creature,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nand came back with not just a collection of photographs,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbut an amazing experience and a great story.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nIt is these kinds of stories,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nthat demonstrate the power of photojournalism.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nI believe that photography can make a real connection to people,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nand can be employed as a positive agent\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nfor understanding the challenges and opportunities\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nfacing our world today.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThank you.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Close-up card magic with a twist", "duration": "1868", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lennart_green_does_close_up_card_magic", "transcript": "My favorite topic is shortcuts. The master of shortcuts \u2014 it's, of course, nature. But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point, to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did. So, first, we violate the common sense, the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this, 90 degrees \u2014 all of you. Not you. All of you, right? Palm up. If you do this, the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist. Do you agree? Good. But I will first teach you a method, how you can do it without moving the wrist, and then the shortcut. You can do it immediately, right? Hold the hand like this, palm up. Don't move the wrist. The wrist is \u2014 I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are. Right-molded you say, with iron? That was a joke, actually, and I \u2014 OK. Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist. Forward, don't move the wrist. Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist. And forward. Yeah. Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 logic, logically, you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist. (Laughter) Now, the shortcut. (Laughter) But it was six moves. Now with one move. I start here, palm down, you can follow. And then look at me. Yeah! (Laughter) One move. OK. So, that was the warming up.Now, I need an assistant. I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe. She has left. No! A big hand. (Applause)Good. Nice. And you can sit over there. One item here was water, right? And I will give my tribute to water. I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about \u2014 cheers. (Laughter) Beer has about \u2014 there's a lot of water in beer. (Laughter)So, now I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing, control cards and so on. And I think I'll take off this one. I work with a special method to do it, quick. I work with precision \u2014 oh, sorry \u2014 control and a very powerful ... memory system, right? (Laughter) So, if \u2014 I have studied the poker. I like to gamble. Officially, I don't gamble but ... So, if we are \u2014 if we have five person, and I will do a five-handed poker game.Now I will interact. So a different person all the time, so not the same person can answer. So we have an agreement. Which one shall have a good poker hand? Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)Lennart Green: Three \u2014 good. And here, I had a mat here to make it a little \u2014 the critical moment is \u2014 sorry. If a card shark gathers the cards together, immediately when he \u2014 before he deals the card. Now, so I think, number three, I have arranged them in a full house. (Laughter) With queens and \u2014 it's OK \u2014 queens and tens. That's a challenge. I like this. I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five. I start with three queens. So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards. And two tens. Yeah. Thank you. (Applause) But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too. So these guys have actually a stronger hand \u2014 three aces and two kings. This guy beats them with four of a kind, or deuce \u2014 deuce. No reaction? That with even \u2014 OK, and this. These look in order, I'm probably \u2014 hopefully \u2014 yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven and ... But, of course, I will have the winning hand. Ten, jack, queen, king, ace. Yeah. So, good. (Laughter) So the hand that looks so good from the beginning, number three, at the end was actually the lowest hand. Such life. Right?So, please mix them. Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some underground techniques. Yes? I work with kind of estimation, shuffle tracking \u2014 ah, good. Impressive. Thank you. (Laughter)So, first, the first term is estimation. Here, I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush. Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker. Right? You agree. So here I have, actually \u2014 I know exactly where the cards are. So here, I can make a bet, and this is actually one of the points where I get my money. So here: 10, jack, queen, king, ace. OK. (Applause)Next is a term \u2014 I do it quick. I call this stealing. So here, I think I know about where the cards are. I will spread the cards and you'll say stop, when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.Zoe: Stop.LG: Here \u2014 you see some are missing? And that's the stealing cards, which I did. (Laughter)OK. Now, another term called shuffle tracking. Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards, even if another person shuffles. This is a little risky. So \u2014 because if you look, now, I can still see it. You agree? But if you square \u2014 square, and shuffle, and then a cut. So here, to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin \u2014 ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK. Come to \u2014 no, no, no, no. I'm joking, yeah? Any style \u2014 yeah, good. Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate. I work direct with the right brain. If you pass the left brain, you have to take care of logic and common sense. Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing. And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor, you have \u2014 that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge, where you can find any solution of any problem.OK. Now, I drop the cards, and you say stop anyway, right? Not at the last card.Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check. (Laughter) Ah, not in order, it \u2014 that was a mistake. No, I'm kidding. (Applause) No, now and then I put in a mistake, just to emphasize how difficult it is. Right? Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake. But now I'm glad I remember it. So, this deck is bought here. Sorry. I have a little pad to make it a little softer. This deck is bought here in America. It's called \"Bicycle.\" And this deck is very flexible, but not so many people know, if you check, if you press at the right spots, you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right? Now, you can carry this in your wallet, so ... You don't see it, make no reaction? (Laughter) So, but here, and \u2014 is the camera getting too much? No. (Laughter)Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this. But not too much. Then you have to push it down again. Here, please. If you push these heaps \u2014 everyone see \u2014 push them together so they are really interlaced, right? Yeah, good. Perfect. Just push them through, good. Thank you. And then, I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite, stealen \u2014 stolen, probably copied from America but we will see.Here \u2014 shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts. Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern. The new chaos theory is already old, right? But you know, I think you are familiar with fractals \u2014 the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way, and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate, then you go to \u2014 then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... Yeah, great. I think I have it.So now, different persons, older, tap. Please name any card, anyone.(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.Jack of spades. I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Yes, right. So \u2014 oh, jack of spades.You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah. My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs. So, jack of spades. I think ... 23 \u2014 24, sorry, 24. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 \u2014 ah, 25, yes. It's the last. Now, I do it quicker, better. OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 actually, my technique is to peek, all the time. When I lift the heap, I peek. You see, yeah, perfect. Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate \u2014 yeah, good. (Laughter)Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven. So I will do it quick, very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow. (Laughter)Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)LG: Diamonds, good. I start here. Good, thank you. (Applause) The thing I did \u2014 I peeked. I know where the card were, then I chose it. So another person, another card. (Laughter) Another person.(Audience: Ten of diamonds.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Ten of diamonds.)LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah. I think I do it the same way. I like to, so I know where it is. Ten of diamonds. But now I do it the regular speed, right? Ten of diamonds. Good. Maybe you will cut? Lift. Excellent. So, thank you. Another person, another card.(Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot. We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards. And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it? Five of clubs. Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here. (Laughter) We do it again. The person who said five of clubs say stop, when the cards are in the air, right?(Audience: Stop.)LG: Very good. OK. (Applause)OK, I had to use a little force there. I think we save five of clubs. And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah. Excellent. I love that card. Here, I will do the most difficult thing. For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas, and you're betting, and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card. And now, when I lift this card, it shall be your card. What was your card?(Audience: Queen of hearts.)LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts. So that's a tough challenge, right? So here, I grab \u2014 you know this? Five of clubs ... and queen of hearts. Yes! This is a tough one, because here I must take advantage of \u2014 I switch it with the five of clubs. So, now a false count. Which card shall I use? Queen or five?Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs. The false count \u2014 and the number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight \u2014 you say the same card all the time. Eight, nine, 10. This is a kind of optical deal, right? When I put one card at a table \u2014 look, it's not one card. It's \u2014 look, it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression. Yeah. Now some hard stuff. I think we keep the queen here, yes. Now, to the satellites things. This \u2014 oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault. (Laughter)This is high-frequency laser, and it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely. Right, sorry, my \u2014 I should have mentioned that, yeah. But you can relax, because it takes half an hour before it works, so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance. (Laughter) Now, I put the laser here, and \u2014 now, when I deal the cards in the laser, I know where they are but \u2014 yes? Did the camera got it? No? They didn't? What happened?(Audience: It disappeared.)LG: OK, I'll take another group. Do the cameras see the cards now?No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)LG: But you see the hand. Ah, good, good, good. But now. So now, that was the reason, right? You see the cards? Yes. (Laughter) Yeah, good. Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen, do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen. (Laughter) Yeah, interesting, but a little dangerous. (Laughter) I liked it. Now, a little more difficult. Name \u2014 anyone, name, please, any suit.(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.So here, here I have to peek, lots of cards. I think there are lots of \u2014 I don't know how many \u2014 but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right? (Laughter) So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right. Then I arrange them so I can get them quick. Perfect, excellent. So I start with the ace \u2014 yeah, ace. Ah, yeah \u2014 spades? Same mistake as before, right? So \u2014 I arrange the spades \u2014 the clubs. I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades. You see, I don't work with prestige, so always do mistakes. It doesn't matter to me. And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right? One, two, three, four \u2014 yes, the camera got it? Five, six, seven, eight \u2014 ah \u2014 nine, 10, the jack, jack of spades, queen of \u2014 I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen. (Laughter) Wait, wait, wait \u2014 please take any card. Grab any one. Quick, quick, good. And we switch this to the king. Ace of diamonds. And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide. So I find ... king of spades. There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct? Yeah? OK. (Applause)Now, a little more difficult thing. Maybe you think I have the cards in order already, so you help me to shuffle again. Another suit, please.(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.) (Laughter)LG: It was after the blindfold. I like this guy, yeah. OK. That should be my end effect, but OK. Armani \u2014 who said Armani? You? I drop the cards and you \u2014 which size? Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges. Which size?(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.Say stop. (Audience: Stop.) (Laughter)LG: Yeah, Armani. OK. (Applause) Ah, this is tough. OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.So, in this case, I try to locate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK. We try. Yeah. You help me. If I drop the card face up, like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK. LG: OK, now. Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good. (Laughter) I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good. So here, diamonds, hearts \u2014 no, diamonds. Good, good. Stop. Do you see the pattern? No? Now? Yes, yes, OK. I work with pattern. Oh sorry, I dropped one. Maybe it's important \u2014 yeah \u2014 nine of diamonds, OK. So now \u2014 I always ask, why do I put myself in this position? I have to figure out so many outs, when I miss some cards, but I love it. So now, I will do it. I will try to find the diamonds, but I will do it the hard way. It's too easy to do it right away, right? I think I will do it ... blindfolded. At this distance, it works immediately. Aargh! (Laughter)Duct tape. I look \u2014 shake the cards, so I don't. Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy. Empathy. But it was \u2014 did you hear? It was women's voice. Hear the guy \u2014 yeah, more, more, more. (Laughter) Yeah, good. Yeah. You can take the nostril too, because some guys think \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do more. Go, go. Right? Good. Satisfied? Looks good, like Batman. Ow! (Laughter) No, with dignity and elegance, right? But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough. And it was OK. One more? The last. OK. All right.Now you must agree that I'm \u2014 I must rely on other senses, right? I work with vibration. So, what was the card? Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts. So now I have to improvise again. Maybe I'll stand up. Half. Diamonds \u2014 I'll start with ace of diamonds. Just kidding, warming up \u2014 king of hearts. (Laughter) And I give you a diamonds, so they \u2014 so you put them here, in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good. Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.LG: Good. Good. Two \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thank you. I never ever miss two. This is interesting. Always I've found two, but the wrong color. Spades, sorry. And the deck is a gift to you after, so let the skepticals here, in this, examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift. Two \u2014 and it was two of spades, right? Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. Three \u2014 three of diamonds. Yes! Four \u2014 I like challenges, yes. Yeah, good.Chris Anderson: You're peeking.LG: Pardon?CA: You're peeking. You just got to \u2014 this is a request from the lady in the back. (Laughter)Okay. Try that. LG: Yeah. Also listen. OK, now. This is maybe a little tough. We will try. Yes? Good? (Laughter) OK. So, how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.LG: Four. Is five the next card?Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.LG: Oh. So here, all the cards are face down \u2014 you agree? (Audience: Yes.)LG: Yes? You see that in the screen? And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here. So next card will be \u2014 was it five?Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah \u2014 I will reverse it face up here.Yes? Zoe: Yeah. LG: Six \u2014 six with the thumb. Seven. Yeah, I do this. I know where it is, because I peeked before and then I do this. Right? Eight. If \u2014 and then nine, right? Yeah. Yesterday \u2014 the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas, and I used this actually. Nine? Yeah? Correct? No? Yes! Ah, good, good. Ten \u2014 once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move. Yeah. Jack \u2014 you [unclear] with Jack? Jack of diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)LG: Yes? And queen! Queen, with misdirection. Misdirection. (Applause) Yeah? And then, king, after exactly five seconds. Yeah. Five. Five seconds. One, two, three, four \u2014 mmm! Check it. Yes?CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah! Good. Oh.

So a different person\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nall the time, so not the same person can answer.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo we have an agreement.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nWhich one shall have a good poker hand?\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nWhich number?

(Audience: Three.)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nLennart Green: Three -- good.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nhere,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI had a mat here to make it a little --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthe critical moment is -- sorry.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIf a card shark gathers the cards together,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nimmediately when he --\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nbefore he deals the card. Now,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso I think, number three,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nI have arranged them in a full house.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nWith queens and -- it's OK --\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nqueens and tens.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThat's a challenge. I like this.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nI will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI start with three queens.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd two tens.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nYeah.

That with even --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nOK, and this.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThese look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nyeah. Three, four, five, six, seven\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand ...\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nBut, of course, I will have the winning hand.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nTen, jack,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nqueen, king, ace.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nYeah. So,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\ngood.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo the hand that looks so good from the beginning,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nnumber three, at the end\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwas actually the lowest hand.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSuch life. Right?\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nSo, please mix them.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nNow, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nunderground techniques.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nYes?\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nI work with\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nkind of estimation,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nshuffle tracking --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nah, good.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nImpressive.

You agree.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nSo here I have, actually --\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nI know exactly where the cards are.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo here, I can make a bet,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand this is actually one of the points where I get my money.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo here: 10, jack,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nqueen, king, ace.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nOK.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nNext\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nis a term --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI do it quick. I call this stealing.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo here, I think\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nI know about where the cards are.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nI will spread the cards and you'll say stop,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwhen I point to them, right. Point, say stop.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nZoe: Stop.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nLG: Here -- you see some are missing?\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd that's the stealing cards, which I did.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nOK.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, another term called shuffle tracking.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nShuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\neven if another person shuffles.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThis is a little risky.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nSo -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nYou agree? But if you square --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nsquare, and shuffle,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand then a cut.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo here,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nto follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nCome to -- no, no, no, no.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nI'm joking, yeah?\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAny style -- yeah, good.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nHere I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nI work direct with the right brain.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nIf you pass the left brain,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nyou have to take care of logic and common sense.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nDirect in the right brain, that's much better. And so --\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nArthur Benjamin did\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\na little of the same thing.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nyou have -- that's the password\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto the\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\ncosmic bank of knowledge,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhere you can find any solution of any problem.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nOK. Now, I drop the cards,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand you say stop anyway, right?\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nNot at the last card.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nZoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nWhen I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAh, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nNo, now and then I put in a mistake,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\njust to emphasize how difficult it is.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nRight?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nBut now I'm glad I remember it.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nSo,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthis deck is bought here.

Ow!\n\n00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.958\nNo, with dignity and elegance, right?\n\n00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:18.958\nBut I like her, yeah.

LG: Okay, thank you."}, {"title": "Dog-friendly dog training", "duration": "886", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ian_dunbar_on_dog_friendly_dog_training", "transcript": "Dogs have interests. They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels. And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction. It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it, and the owner says, you know, \"Puppy, come here, come here,\" and the dog thinks, \"Hmm, interesting. I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling.\" It's a difficult choice, right? Rear end, owner. Rear end wins. I mean, you lose. You cannot compete with the environment, if you have an adolescent dog's brain. So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view.Now, I'm here largely because there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that \u2014 on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog, number one, by making up rules, human rules. We don't take the dog's point of view into account. So the human says, \"You're going to act this way, damn it. We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.\" Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog. And then number three, now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed. So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew. When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg \u2014 you know, isn't that nice? And you go, \"Oh, there's a good boy.\" You bend down, you pat him \u2014 you reward him for jumping up. His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later, he weighs, you know, 80 pounds. Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse. I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.So, this whole dominance issue \u2014 number one, what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system. And they take this stuff seriously. Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy, because it prevents physical fights. Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand, have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule. The number one is, \"I have it, you don't.\" And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male. So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances, or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.Dogs get so abused. Dogs, horses and humans \u2014 these are the three species which are so abused in life. And the reason is built into their behavior \u2014 is to always come back and apologize. Like, \"Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault.\" They are just so beatable, and that's why they get beaten. The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say? \"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws, stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice, hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper, knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.\" Because he grew? And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do? This is insanity. I ask owners, \"Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?\" And people say, \"Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.\" I said, \"Let's teach him to sit.\" And then we give him a reason for sitting. Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL. I could speak to you and say, \"Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey.\" Go on, something should happen now. Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili. Well, I've got news for you. The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL, English as a second language. And that's how we use the food lure in the hand, and we use food because we're dealing with owners. My wife doesn't need food \u2014 she's a great trainer, much better than I am. I don't need food, but the average owner says, \"Puppy, sit.\" Or they go, \"Sit, sit, sit.\" They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason, like the dog has a third eye there \u2014 it's insane. You know, \"Sit, sit.\" No, we go, \"Puppy, sit\" \u2014 boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.Then we phase out the food as a lure, and now the dog knows that \"sit\" means sit, and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence. \"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please.\" And I've taught her \"Phoenix,\" \"come here,\" \"take this,\" \"go to\" and the name of my son, \"Jamie.\" And the dog can take a note, and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog. He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, \"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.\"So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do. Will it do it? Not necessarily, no. As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff, why come to the owner? The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time. The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to. At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do, and this is very easy. We use the Premack principle. Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior \u2014 one the dog doesn't want to do \u2014 by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem, or a dog hobby \u2014 something the dog does like to do. That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior. So we go, \"sit,\" on the couch; \"sit,\" tummy-rub; \"sit,\" look, I throw a tennis ball; \"sit,\" say hello to that other dog. Yes, we put \"sniff butt\" on queue. \"Sit,\" sniff butt.So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training. And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like \u2014 we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us. And I can imagine this dog, you know, speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita, saying, \"Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train. They're like Golden Retrievers. All I have to do is sit, and they do everything. They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me, they will throw tennis balls, they will cook for me and serve the food. It's like, if I just sit, that's my command. Then I have my own personal doorman, chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter.\" And now the dog's really happy. And this, to me, is always what training is. So we really motivate the dog to want to do it, such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.Now we move to phase three, when now \u2014 there's times, you know, when daddy knows best. And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, \"Because I'm the daddy, that's why.\" Sorry, no more explanation. \"I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit.\" And there's times, for example, if my son's friends leave the door open, the dogs have to know you don't step across this line. This is a life-or-death thing. You leave this, the sanctity of your house, and you could be hit on the street. So some things we have to let the dog know, \"You mustn't do this.\"And so we have to enforce, but without force. People here get very confused about what a punishment is. They think a punishment is something nasty. I bet a lot of you do, right? You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty. It doesn't have to be. There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is: a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior, such that it's less likely to occur in the future. It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful. And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago. And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus the brother-in-law, plus the child. And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house, and they never took it outside. The dog is actually euthanized now, but this was a dog I worked with for a while. A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen, so while I was there \u2014 this was on the fourth visit \u2014 we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat. And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence. When the dog would try to leave the mat, she would say, \"Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.\" The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner, because we had a lot of aggression related towards food. The breaks got fewer and fewer. You see, the punishment was working. The behavior problem was going away. She never raised her voice. If she did, she would have got bitten. It's not a good dog you shout at. And a lot of my friends train really neat animals, grizzly bears \u2014 if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it \u2014 killer whales. I love it because it wires you up. How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear? \"Bad bear, bad bear!\" Voom! Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK? This is crazy.So, where do we go from here? We want a better way. Dogs deserve better. But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs. It has to do with watching people train puppies, and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills, horrendous relationship skills. Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class. I mean, my all-time classic is another \"come here\" one. You see someone in the park \u2014 and I'll cover my mic when I say this, because I don't want to wake you up \u2014 and there's the owner in the park, and their dog's over here, and they say, \"Rover, come here. Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch.\" The dog says, \"I don't think so.\" (Laughter) I mean, who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that? Instead, the dog says, \"I know that tone. I know that tone. Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there.\" I was walking onto a plane \u2014 this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career, and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy-training thing, the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them. You know, I puppy-train my child. And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas, and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five, kicking the back of the chair. \"Johnny, don't do that.\" Kick, kick, kick. \"Johnny, don't do that.\" Kick, kick, kick. I'm standing right here with my bag. The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face. And ugly face is this \u2014 when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child, you say, \"What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!\" And I went, \"Oh my God, do I do something?\" That child has lost everything \u2014 that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet. And I thought, \"Do I tell this jerk to quit it?\" I thought, \"Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on.\" I walked to the back of the plane, I sat down, and a thought came to me. If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out. (Laughter) If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out. He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.And this is what it's all about. These relationship skills are so easy. I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate based on the three Cs \u2014 coat color, conformation, cuteness. You know, kind of like a little robot. This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year. And then, a little behavior problem comes up. No different from the dog barking. The husband won't clear up his clothes, or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK? And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback \u2014 there's two things about it. When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent. And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty. You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents. You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee. It's as if there's some schadenfreude there, that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong, so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have. It really is. We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad. And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught. You know, calculus is wonderful. When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz. I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid. Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics \u2014 these are cool things. But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.And my look to the future is, and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people that you know, your husband's just as easy to train. Probably easier \u2014 if you got a Rottie \u2014 much easier to train. Your kids are easy to train. All you've got to do is to watch them, to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes, you ask the question, \"Is it good, or is it bad?\" If it's good, say, \"That was really neat, thank you.\" That is such a powerful training technique. This should be taught in schools. Relationships \u2014 how do you negotiate? How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy? You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship? How on earth about raising children? We think how we do it \u2014 one night in bed, we're pregnant, and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child. No, this is what should be taught \u2014 the good living, the good habits, which are just as hard to break as bad habits. So, that would be my wish to the future. Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time, but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two \u2014 so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.

Rear end wins.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI mean, you lose.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nYou cannot compete with the environment,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nif you have an adolescent dog's brain.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nSo, when we train, we're always trying to take into account\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nthe dog's point of view.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nNow, I'm here largely because\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nthere's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthat -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nnumber one, by making up rules, human rules.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nWe don't take the dog's point of view into account.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nSo the human says, \"You're going to act this way, damn it.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nWe're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.\"\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThen, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd then number three, now we can punish the dog\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nfor breaking rules he didn't even know existed.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nWhen he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nyou know, isn't that nice?\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd you go, \"Oh, there's a good boy.\"\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nYou bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nHis one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhe weighs, you know, 80 pounds.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nEvery time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo, this whole dominance issue -- number one,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwhat we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nof a very complicated social system.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd they take this stuff seriously.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nMale dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbecause it prevents physical fights.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nOf course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nhave several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThe number one is, \"I have it, you don't.\"\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwill quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSo, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nor of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nDogs get so abused.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nDogs, horses and humans --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nthese are the three species which are so abused in life.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd the reason is built into their behavior --\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nis to always come back and apologize.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nLike, \"Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThey are just so beatable,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand that's why they get beaten.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThe poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\n\"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nstamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nhit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nknee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.\"\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBecause he grew?\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThis is insanity.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI ask owners, \"Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd people say, \"Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nI said, \"Let's teach him to sit.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd then we give him a reason for sitting.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nBecause the first stage\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nis basically teaching a dog ESL.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nI could speak to you and say, \"Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey.\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nGo on, something should happen now.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nWhy aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nWell, I've got news for you.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThe dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nEnglish as a second language.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd that's how we use the food lure in the hand,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand we use food because we're dealing with owners.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nMy wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nmuch better than I am.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nI don't need food, but the average owner says,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n\"Puppy, sit.\"\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nOr they go, \"Sit, sit, sit.\"\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nlike the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nYou know, \"Sit, sit.\"\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nNo, we go, \"Puppy, sit\" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThen we phase out the food as a lure,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand now the dog knows that \"sit\" means sit,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand you can actually communicate to a dog\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nin a perfectly constructed English sentence.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\n\"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please.\"\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd I've taught her \"Phoenix,\" \"come here,\" \"take this,\" \"go to\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand the name of my son, \"Jamie.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd the dog can take a note,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nHe'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand take him a little message that says,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\n\"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.\"\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSo, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nWill it do it?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nNot necessarily, no.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAs I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwhy come to the owner?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThe dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nThe dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAt the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwith smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwhat we want him to do, and this is very easy.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nWe use the Premack principle.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nBasically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\none the dog doesn't want to do --\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nby a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nor a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThat will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo we go, \"sit,\" on the couch; \"sit,\" tummy-rub; \"sit,\"\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nlook, I throw a tennis ball; \"sit,\" say hello to that other dog.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nYes, we put \"sniff butt\" on queue.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"Sit,\" sniff butt.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo now all of these distractions that worked against training\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nnow become rewards that work for training.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwe're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd I can imagine this dog, you know,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nspeaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nsaying, \"Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThey're like Golden Retrievers.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAll I have to do is sit, and they do everything.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nThey open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthey will throw tennis balls,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthey will cook for me and serve the food.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIt's like, if I just sit, that's my command.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThen I have my own personal doorman,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nchauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter.\"\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd now the dog's really happy.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd this, to me, is always what training is.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo we really motivate the dog to want to do it,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nsuch that the need for punishment seldom comes up.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nNow we move to phase three, when now --\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthere's times, you know, when daddy knows best.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n\"Because I'm the daddy, that's why.\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSorry, no more explanation. \"I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit.\"\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd there's times, for example,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nif my son's friends leave the door open,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe dogs have to know you don't step across this line.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThis is a life-or-death thing.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nYou leave this, the sanctity of your house,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand you could be hit on the street.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nSo some things we have to let the dog know,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\n\"You mustn't do this.\"\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd so we have to enforce, but without force.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nPeople here get very confused about what a punishment is.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nThey think a punishment is something nasty.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nI bet a lot of you do, right?\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nYou think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThere's several definitions of what a punishment is,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbut one definition, the most popular, is:\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\na punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nsuch that it's less likely to occur in the future.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nplus the brother-in-law, plus the child.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand they never took it outside.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThe dog is actually euthanized now,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nbut this was a dog I worked with for a while.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nA lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nso while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nwe did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWhen the dog would try to leave the mat,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nshe would say, \"Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.\"\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThe dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nbecause we had a lot of aggression related towards food.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nThe breaks got fewer and fewer.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nYou see, the punishment was working.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThe behavior problem was going away.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nShe never raised her voice.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIf she did, she would have got bitten.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nIt's not a good dog you shout at.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd a lot of my friends train really neat animals,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\ngrizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\non the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nkiller whales. I love it because it wires you up.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nHow are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n\"Bad bear, bad bear!\" Voom!\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nYour head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThis is crazy.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nWe want a better way.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDogs deserve better.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nBut for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt has to do with watching people train puppies,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nhorrendous relationship skills.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nNot just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI mean, my all-time classic is another \"come here\" one.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nYou see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbecause I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand their dog's over here, and they say, \"Rover, come here.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nRover, come here.

Not being the musicians \u2014 the listeners, right? And we crave one thing, even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded, the day it was played. And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history, the little rougher it sounds. And so we said, there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance, as a thing, out from the recording, which was how it was made. You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers, and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things \u2014 but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition. And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley, in terms of \u2014 artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we, you know, kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note, and all the attributes of those notes: how hard they were struck, and how they were held down, and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you, but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like \u2014 a performing monkey was, in fact, his term. So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called \"The Goldberg Variations.\" Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces, but late in his life, in his mature period, he said, \"Here's a theme \u2014 30 variations.\" In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo. And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal, and as he got older, he said, \"No, no, wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal.\" What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version, and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould, 1955. (Music) How about that? (Applause)So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all, let me get you to the end step. This is \u2014 we have a fairly complex process that, you know, software and musicians and so on, but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording, and the left speaker is going to be the new recording, actually of an instrument just like that one, and I'm going to play them together at the same time. (Music) That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together. (Music)Before \"Jurassic Park,\" there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right? So, in the video world, we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately, I started with the experience. And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound. And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround, go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings \u2014 Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument, and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this, you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians, who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say, \"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano.\" Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano, and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer.Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt, and steel strings, and all these, and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session, you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things, step-by-step music will be turned into data, like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years. Audio has come very late to this game \u2014 I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from, which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool \u2014 they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions, and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.All right, there's this episode of \"Star Trek.\" (Laughter) I get it \u2014 it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of \"Star Trek\" for me was James Daly played Methuselah \u2014 remember this one? And at some point he's dancing with his \u2014 and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967. Right, do you know where I'm going? And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano, and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round, he goes, \"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes, and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.\" That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data, that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things, again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data \u2014 no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet, it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today, every time you take out your iPod and whatever, every time you listen to it, it's the same thing \u2014 it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different? This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song, the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.We've seen all these \"Star Treks,\" and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps. It's so amazing, it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.\" It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form. And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949. And I've got to tell you, we have this lab where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company, I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling, when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team, and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine, which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people. And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ... and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately, it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor. (Music) (Applause) And that's just what the live audience did. (Applause) So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.", "id": 329, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nNinety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nNot being the musicians -- the listeners, right?\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nAnd we crave one thing,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\neven though we kind of don't know it all the time.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nWe crave to be in the room with the musician\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthe day it was recorded, the day it was played.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nBut then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd it turns out the further back you go in history,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nthe little rougher it sounds.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd so we said, there's a solution to this.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nLet's separate the performance, as a thing,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nout from the recording, which was how it was made.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nYou know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nBut the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand what instruments they were using.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nAnd it's the data hidden inside the recording.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nIn order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat runs in a very high resolution.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthat looks like a nice grand piano there.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nbut full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand all this kind of stuff.

[Unclear] That's the two together.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:50.958\n(Music)\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nBefore \"Jurassic Park,\"\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthere was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo, in the video world,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwe've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd this is kind of another example\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nof putting a science behind natural behavior.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd then you heard the original.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nUltimately, I started with the experience.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nLots of you can afford to buy one of these.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nBut, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\ngo down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIt's so involving compared to regular stereo.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nBut if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd so on the same disk we have five recordings --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSony has five recordings.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd you could listen in headphones\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwith this thing called binaural recording.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand it's got microphones where the ears are.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nyou're inside of Glenn Gould's body.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwho are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\n\"I can't believe it!

easily.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nYour eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAll right, there's this episode of \"Star Trek.\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe episode of \"Star Trek\" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nremember this one?\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd at some point he's dancing with his --\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nRight, do you know where I'm going?\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd then Spock turns round, he goes,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n\"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand I don't believe this is one of them in the category.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThat's where I'm at.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nI want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthat we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nagain, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt's now coming in this world.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThe transition will be this one.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd I believe this is coming.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBecause what you've just heard was a computer playing data --\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nno Glenn Gould in the room.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut yet, it was human.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nEvery time you listen to a recording today,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nevery time you take out your iPod and whatever,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nevery time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThis morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthe same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nYou want to hear it played by different musicians.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nYou want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWe've seen all these \"Star Treks,\" and they're all holodeck episodes as well.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nEvery time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIt's so amazing, it's so exciting.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nEvery time I listen to that recording it's like, \"Oh my God,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nI can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nIt's a way better experience\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthan whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nSo I've really overshot my budget here.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe made a new recording of him\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nplaying in the Shrine Auditorium in September.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nIt was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd I've got to tell you, we have this lab\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwhere we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand we flew out to Los Angeles.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd as the president of the company,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThat's a real uncomfortable feeling,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhen all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand people are going to be sitting there in the audience.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwhich has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nwas perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd we captured all that data all over again.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd I want you to hear that right now.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd fortunately, it's right in here.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThis is an encore he used to do.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nIt's one minute long.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nIt's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:13:18.958\n(Music)\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd that's just what the live audience did.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nSo thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity."}]

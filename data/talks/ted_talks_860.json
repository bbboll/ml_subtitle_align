[{"title": "Creative houses from reclaimed stuff", "duration": "1077", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_phillips_creative_houses_from_reclaimed_stuff", "transcript": "(Applause)Thank you very much. I have a few pictures, and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. All these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material, stuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile. It was all just gone. This is the first house I built. This double front door here with the three-light transom, that was headed to the landfill. Have a little turret there. And then these buttons on the corbels here \u2014 right there \u2014 those are hickory nuts. And these buttons there \u2014 those are chicken eggs.(Laughter)Of course, first you have breakfast, and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up, and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time.This is a look at the inside. You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows. Certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill \u2014 even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars. Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. There's a 1952 O'Keefe & Merritt stove, if you like to cook \u2014 cool stove. This is going up into the turret. I got that staircase for 20 dollars, including delivery to my lot.(Laughter)Then, looking up in the turret, you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. Well, if that ruins your life, well, then, you shouldn't live there.(Laughter)This is a laundry chute. And this right here is a shoe last \u2014 those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last, and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down. And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer. If not, it goes into the toilet.(Laughter)This is a bathtub I made, made out of scrap two-by-four. Started with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat, corbeled it up and flipped it over, then did the two profiles on this side. It's a two-person tub. After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well.(Laughter)Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange. It looks a little phallic, but after all, it's a bathroom.(Laughter)This is a house based on a Budweiser can. It doesn't look like a can of beer, but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable: the barley hops design worked up into the eaves, then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver. Then, these corbels going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. Then, on the can it says, \"This is the famous Budweiser beer, we know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah.\" So we changed that and put, \"This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ...\" and so forth and so on. This is a deadbolt. It's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine. And they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper, so we made a deadbolt out of it. That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.(Laughter)And sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants.(Laughter)The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. We've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. Where do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't. But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles. And then the faucet is a beer tap.(Laughter)Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America. We're getting tired of it. It's kind of clich\u00e9d now. If you put it in the front door, your design fails. So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else. It's a pretty panel of glass. But if you put it in the front door, people say, \"Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it.\" So don't put it there. Then, another bathroom upstairs. This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America. Don't put it in the foyer. Put it in the shower, or in the closet, but not in the foyer. Then, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet.(Laughter)This little house here, those branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange. These pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit.In order to do what I do, you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. Our housing has become a commodity, and I'll talk a little bit about that. But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. What does that mean? What it means is, for every perception we have, it needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented. So I can show you an object you've never seen before. Oh, that's a cell phone. But you've never seen this one before. What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features, and then you go through your databanks: Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone. If I took a bite out of it, you'd go, \"Wait a second.(Laughter)\"That's not a cell phone. That's one of those new chocolate cell phones.\"(Laughter)You'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate.(Laughter)That's how we process information.You translate that to the building industry. If we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, \"Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. Let's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in.\" Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all. It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. However, if we took a small hammer, and we added cracks to all the other windows \u2014(Laughter)then we have a pattern. Because Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. We'll go, \"Ooh, that's nice.\" So, that serves me every day. Repetition creates pattern. If I have 100 of these, 100 of those, it makes no difference what these and those are. If I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern, from hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches. It doesn't make any difference. That causes a lot of waste in the building industry.The second cause is, Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885, wrote a book titled \"The Birth of Tragedy.\" And in there, he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives: on the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective, which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. On the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective, which is more given to the passions and intuition, tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is, they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer. \"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!\" Predicated on plumb level, square and centered. The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes:(Laughter)That's the difference. I feature blemish. I feature organic process. Dead center John Dewey. Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. If something isn't perfect, if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model? Dumpster. \"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster.\" \"Oops\" this, \"oops\" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill.The third thing is arguably \u2014 The Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism, then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower. And we have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we, up to that point, had to do by hand. So now we have standardized materials. Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches, eight, ten and twelve feet tall.(Laughter)We create mountains of waste. And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest, working all the byproduct of their industry \u2014 with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on \u2014 but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption. And that's what's happening. And so if something isn't standard, \"Oops, dumpster.\" \"Oops\" this. \"Oops, warped.\" If you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight, you can take it back. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one.\" Well, I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective.The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. Well, that's just a myth. And there's a story: Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained \u2014 I said, \"Jim, it's time now. I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go.\" \"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready.\" \"Jim, now it's time. You're the down \u2014 oh!\" So we hired on. And he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap, looking for header material, or the board that goes over a door, thinking he'd impress his boss \u2014 that's how we taught him to do it. The superintendent walked up and said, \"What are you doing?\" \"Oh, just looking for header material,\" waiting for that kudos. He said, \"I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work.\" And Jim had the wherewithal to say, \"You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour, I can see how you might say that. But right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute. Do the math.\"(Laughter)\"Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first.\" And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math.(Laughter)But once in a while, you get access to the control room, and then you can kind of mess with the dials. And that's what happened there.The fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years, Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want, and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. So we all have in our head the perfect house, the American dream, which is a house, the dream house. The problem is we can't afford it. So we have the American dream look-alike, which is a mobile home. Now there's a blight on the planet.(Laughter)It's a chattel mortgage, just like furniture, just like a car. You write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent. After a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it, only on 70 percent. Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically. Nothing wrong with that, unless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do, and that's what happens. It out-gasses formaldehyde \u2014 so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. Are we just being numbingly stupid? The walls are this thick. The whole thing has the structural value of corn.(Laughter)\"So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there.\" \"No, no. We had a wind last night. It's gone now.\"(Laughter)Then when they degrade, what do you do with them?Now, all that \u2014 that Apollonian, Platonic model \u2014 is what the building industry is predicated on, and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. One is that all the professionals, all the tradesmen, vendors, inspectors, engineers, architects all think like this. And then it works its way back to the consumer, who demands the same model. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers. \"Woo. Woo-hoo.\" We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. How disgusting.(Laughter)But you know what they did? They hooked a metaphor into it and said, \"I drink Dr. Pepper ...\" And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons. It doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular.(Laughter)My oh my, that makes it worse. And we get sucked into that faster than anything.Then, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled \"Being and Nothingness.\" It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe \u2014(Laughter)maybe two years, if you read eight hours a day. In there, he talked about the divided self. He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. So if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone, I can eat like a backhoe. I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table, chew with my mouth open, make little noises, scratch wherever I want.(Laughter)But as soon as you walk in, I go, \"Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there.\" Napkin in my lap, half-bites, chew with my mouth closed, no scratching. Now, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. I feel that expectation, and so I accommodate it, and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. That happens in the building industry as well. That's why all subdivisions look the same. Sometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations. I'll bet all your shoes match. Sure enough, we all buy into that ...(Laughter)And with gated communities, we have a formalized expectation, with a homeowners' association. Sometimes those guys are Nazis, my oh my. That exacerbates and continues this model.The last thing is gregariousness. Human beings are a social species. We like to hang together in groups, just like wildebeests, just like lions. Wildebeests don't hang with lions, because lions eat wildebeests. Human beings are like that. We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. You see this in junior high a lot. Those kids, they'll work all summer long \u2014 kill themselves \u2014 so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. So along about September, they can stride in and go, \"I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans! I see you don't have designer jeans. You're not one of the beautiful \u2014 See, I'm one of the beautiful people. See my jeans?\" Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. And so that happens in the building industry as well.We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs, just a little bit. On the bottom tier, we have basic needs: shelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth. Second: security. Third: relationships. Fourth: status, self-esteem \u2014 that is, vanity \u2014 and we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. And so we end up with vain decisions, and we can't even afford our mortgage. We can't afford to eat anything except beans;that is, our housing has become a commodity. And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal, terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity, but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. That takes a little bit of nerve, and, darn it, once in a while, you fail. But that's okay. If failure destroys you, then you can't do this. I fail all the time, every day, and I've had some whopping failures, I promise \u2014 big, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures.Everybody points and laughs, and they say, \"He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work! What a moron!\" Early on, contractors come by and say, \"Dan, you're a cute little bunny, but you know, this just isn't going to work. What don't you do this? Why don't you do that?\" And your instinct is to say, \"Well, why don't you suck an egg?\"(Laughter)But you don't say that, because they're the guys you're targeting.And so what we've done \u2014 and this isn't just in housing; it's in clothing and food and our transportation needs, our energy \u2014 we sprawl just a little bit. And when I get a little bit of press, I hear from people all over the world. And we may have invented excess, but the problem of waste is worldwide. We're in trouble. And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana. But we're clearly in trouble. And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say, \"You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. What do you think, honey?\" If it doesn't work, take it down. What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are, and that's thrilling indeed.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1015, "subtitle":

design\nworked up into the eaves,\n\n00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:58.935\nthen the dentil work comes directly\noff the can's red, white, blue and silver.\n\n00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.397\nThen, these corbels going\ndown underneath the eaves\n\n00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.599\nare that little design\nthat comes off the can.\n\n00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.242\nI just put a can on a copier\nand kept enlarging it\n\n00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.782\nuntil I got the size I want.\n\n00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:10.353\nThen, on the can it says,\n\n00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:12.084\n\"This is the famous Budweiser beer,\n\n00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.166\nwe know of no other beer,\nblah, blah, blah.\"\n\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.483\nSo we changed that and put,\n\n00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:19.006\n\"This is the famous Budweiser house.\nWe don't know of any other house ...\"\n\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.182\nand so forth and so on.\n\n00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:21.363\nThis is a deadbolt.\n\n00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:25.129\nIt's a fence from a 1930s shaper,\nwhich is a very angry woodworking machine.\n\n00:03:25.153 --> 00:03:28.129\nAnd they gave me the fence,\nbut they didn't give me the shaper,\n\n00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:29.824\nso we made a deadbolt out of it.\n\n00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:32.089\nThat'll keep bull elephants\nout, I promise.\n\n00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:33.118\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:35.996\nAnd sure enough, we've had\nno problems with bull elephants.\n\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.182\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:37.206 -->

My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old. I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. I must admit, I used to be one of them. I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.What I discovered was this is not true. I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family. I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature \u2014 like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy. (Laughter) The seeds are then planted, then grown. The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. And most folks don't even know they exist. Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. And let me tell you, corn is in everything. And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS.(Laughter)Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs. When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too. Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets.So I ask myself, how can I change? How can I change these things? This is what I found out. I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. Now a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player. I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. (Applause) Thank you. And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. Since I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day. This man, this \"lunatic farmer,\" doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified seeds. And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life. Some people say organic or local food is more expensive, but is it really? With all these things I've been learning about the food system, it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital. (Applause) Now I know definitely which one I would choose. I want you to know that there are farms out there \u2014 like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee \u2014 whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer, so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. I want you to know that me, my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. I try to share this everywhere I go.Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal. He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes \u2014 you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time.So next time you're at the grocery store, think local, choose organic, know your farmer and know your food. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1016, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nHello.

To the first son, he left half the camels; to the second son, he left a third of the camels; and to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels. The three sons got into a negotiation \u2014 17 doesn't divide by two. It doesn't divide by three. It doesn't divide by nine. Brotherly tempers started to get strained. Finally, in desperation, they went and they consulted a wise old woman. The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time, and finally she came back and said, \"Well, I don't know if I can help you, but at least, if you want, you can have my camel.\" So then, they had 18 camels. The first son took his half \u2014 half of 18 is nine. The second son took his third \u2014 a third of 18 is six. The youngest son took his ninth \u2014 a ninth of 18 is two. You get 17. They had one camel left over. They gave it back to the wise old woman.(Laughter)Now, if you think about that story for a moment, I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. They start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it. Somehow, what we need to do is step back from those situations, like that wise old woman, look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel. Finding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion.I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. We're all one family. We know that scientifically, thanks to the communications revolution, all the tribes on the planet \u2014 all 15,000 tribes \u2014 are in touch with each other. And it's a big family reunion. And yet, like many family reunions, it's not all peace and light. There's a lot of conflict, and the question is: How do we deal with our differences? How do we deal with our deepest differences, given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction? That's the question.As I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four, traveling the world, trying to work, getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela \u2014 some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet \u2014 I've been asking myself that question. And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace. It's actually surprisingly simple. It's not easy, but it's simple. It's not even new. It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. The secret to peace is us. It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict, who can play a constructive role.Let me give you just a story, an example. About 20 years ago, I was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict, and I had an extra month, so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. I was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict. Because, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers, living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story. And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting \u2014 absolutely fatal. So how do they deal with their differences? Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities, someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush, and then everyone sits around in a circle like this, and they sit and they talk and they talk. It may take two days, three days, four days, but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet \u2014 a reconciliation. And if tempers are still too high, then they send someone off to visit some relatives, as a cooling-off period.Well, that system is, I think, probably the system that kept us alive to this point, given our human tendencies. That system, I call \"the third side.\" Because if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict, when we describe it, there's always two sides \u2014 it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management, husband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats. But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side, and the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community, it's the friends, the allies, the family members, the neighbors. And we can play an incredibly constructive role.Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. For the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family, for the sake of the community, for the sake of the future, let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. Because, the thing is, when we're involved in conflict, it's very easy to lose perspective. It's very easy to react. Human beings \u2014 we're reaction machines. And as the saying goes, when angry, you will make the best speech you will ever regret.(Laughter)And so the third side reminds us of that. The third side helps us go to the balcony, which is a metaphor for a place of perspective, where we can keep our eyes on the prize.Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. Some years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. There was a war going on, as you know. And we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace, in the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place. And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said, \"You should stay right here in your seats, because you're going to be on trial for war crimes.\" And then he turned to me and said, \"You're an American. Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico.\" And my mind started racing, \"Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?\" I started reacting.(Laughter)But then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony. And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response, from a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks and say, \"I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another.\"(Laughter)\"And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya.\" The conversation got back on track. That's the role of the third side, to help the parties go to the balcony.Now let me take you, for a moment, to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict, or the most impossible conflict, the Middle East. Question is: where's the third side there? How could we possibly go to the balcony? Now, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict, but I think I've got a first step \u2014 literally, a first step \u2014 something that any one of us could do as third-siders. Let me just ask you one question first. How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do? Just out of curiosity, how many of you? OK, so the great majority of us. And here, it's so far away. Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict? Is it the number of deaths? There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. No, it's because of the story, because we feel personally involved in that story. Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious, we feel we have a personal stake in it.Stories matter; as an anthropologist, I know that. Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. They give meaning to our lives. That's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories. Stories are the key. And so my question is \u2014 yes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East, but let's also take a look at the story. Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. What would that mean? What is the story there?Now, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story. What's the origin story of the Middle East? In a phrase, it's: Four thousand years ago, a man and his family walked across the Middle East, and the world has never been the same since. That man, of course, was Abraham. And what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family; he's the father of us all. But it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was. His basic message was unity too, the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all. And his basic value was respect, was kindness toward strangers. That's what he's known for, his hospitality. So in that sense, he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. Now, think about that for a moment.Today, we face the scourge of terrorism. What is terrorism? Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. What's the opposite of terrorism? It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home, in order to sow and create understanding or respect, or love.So what if, then, you took the story of Abraham, which is a third-side story, what if that could be \u2014 because Abraham stands for hospitality \u2014 what if that could be an antidote to terrorism? What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance? How would you bring that story to life? Now, it's not enough just to tell a story. That's powerful, but people need to experience the story. They need to be able to live the story. How would you do that? And that was my thinking of how would you do that. And that's what comes to the first step here. Because the simple way to do that is: you go for a walk. You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. Because walking has a real power. You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human. It's funny \u2014 when you walk, you walk side-by-side, in the same common direction. Now if I were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you, you would feel threatened. But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder, even touching shoulders, it's no problem. Who fights while they walk? That's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough, people go for walks in the woods.So the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path, a route \u2014 think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail \u2014 that followed in the footsteps of Abraham? People said, \"That's crazy. You can't. You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham \u2014 it's too insecure, you've got to cross all these borders, it goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East, because it unites them all.\" And so we studied the idea at Harvard. We did our due diligence. And then a few years ago, a group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries, decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham, going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia. And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey. Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo, which, turns out, is named after Abraham. We went to Damascus, which has a long history associated with Abraham. We then came to Northern Jordan, to Jerusalem \u2014 which is all about Abraham \u2014 to Bethlehem, and finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron. So effectively, we went from womb to tomb. We showed it could be done. It was an amazing journey.Let me ask you a question. How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land, and a total stranger, perfect stranger, comes up to you and shows you some kindness \u2014 maybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink, gives you a coffee, gives you a meal? How many of you have ever had that experience? That's the essence of the Abraham Path. That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility, and you get the most amazing hospitality, all associated with Abraham: \"In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food.\" So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people; he's alive, he's a living presence.And to make a long story short, in the last couple of years now, thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East, enjoying the hospitality of the people there. They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine, in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria. It's an amazing experience. Men, women, young people, old people \u2014 more women than men, actually, interestingly.For those who can't walk, who are unable to get there right now, people started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities. In Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. It was Abraham Path Day. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run, uniting the different communities. The media love it; they really adore it. They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea, this idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers. And just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it. Last month, there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it, two whole pages. And they quoted a villager who said, \"This walk connects us to the world.\" He said, \"It was like a light that went on in our lives \u2014 it brought us hope.\" And so that's what it's about.But it's not just about psychology; it's about economics. Because as people walk, they spend money. And this woman right here, Um Ahmad, is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. She's desperately poor. She's partially blind, her husband can't work, she's got seven kids. But what she can do is cook. And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. They sit on the floor \u2014 she doesn't even have a tablecloth. She makes the most delicious food, that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. And so more and more walkers have come, and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. And so she told our team there, she said, \"You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me.\" That's the potential of the Abraham Path.There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East, across the path. The potential is basically to change the game. And to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things \u2014 to change the frame from hostility to hospitality, from terrorism to tourism. And in that sense, the Abraham Path is a game-changer.Let me just show you one thing. I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course \u2014 grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham. The path right now is like an acorn; it's still in its early phase. What would the oak tree look like? When I think back to my childhood, a good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago, I spent in Europe. If you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin, and you had said, \"Sixty years from now, this is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet,\" people would have thought you were certifiably insane. But they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe, and a common economy. So my question is, if it can be done in Europe, why not in the Middle East? Why not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham, and thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism?So let me conclude, then, by saying that in the last 35 years, as I've worked in some of the most dangerous, difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet, I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. It's not easy, of course. But it's possible. It was done in South Africa. It was done in Northern Ireland. It could be done anywhere. It simply depends on us. It depends on us taking the third side. So let me invite you to consider taking the third side, even as a very small step. We're about to take a break in a moment. Just go up to someone who's from a different culture, a different country, a different ethnicity \u2014 some difference \u2014 and engage them in a conversation. Listen to them. That's a third-side act. That's walking Abraham's Path. After a TED Talk, why not a TED Walk?(Laughter)So let me just leave you with three things. One is, the secret to peace is the third side. The third side is us. Each of us, with a single step, can take the world, can bring the world a step closer to peace. There's an old African proverb that goes: \"When spiderwebs unite, they can halt even the lion.\" If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace, we can even halt the lion of war.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1017, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.132\nWell, the subject of difficult negotiation\n\n00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:18.934\nreminds me of one of my favorite stories\nfrom the Middle East,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.712\nof a man who left\nto his three sons, 17 camels.\n\n00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:24.934\nTo the first son, he left half the camels;\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.348\nto the second son,\nhe left a third of the camels;\n\n00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.967\nand to the youngest son,\nhe left a ninth of the camels.\n\n00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:33.805\nThe three sons got into a negotiation --\n17 doesn't divide by two.\n\n00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.567\nIt doesn't divide by three.\n\n00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:37.130\nIt doesn't divide by nine.\n\n00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:39.400\nBrotherly tempers started to get strained.\n\n00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:40.703\nFinally, in desperation,\n\n00:00:40.727 --> 00:00:44.388\nthey went and they consulted\na wise old woman.\n\n00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:47.387\nThe wise old woman thought\nabout their problem for a long time,\n\n00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:50.915\nand finally she came back and said,\n\"Well, I don't know if I can help you,\n\n00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.316\nbut at least, if you want,\nyou can have my camel.\"\n\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.808\nSo then, they had 18 camels.\n\n00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:57.690\nThe first son took his half --\nhalf of 18 is nine.\n\n00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:00.408\nThe second son took his third --\na third of 18 is six.\n\n00:01:00.432 --> 00:01:03.934\nThe youngest son took his ninth --\na ninth of 18 is two.\n\n00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.517\nYou get 17.\n\n00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.351\nThey had one camel left over.\n\n00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.303\nThey gave it back to the wise old woman.\n\n00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:11.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.197\nNow, if you think\nabout that story for a moment,\n\n00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.792\nI think it resembles a lot\nof the difficult negotiations\n\n00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.030\nwe get involved in.\n\n00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:21.530\nThey start off like 17 camels,\nno way to resolve it.\n\n00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:22.990\nSomehow, what we need to do\n\n00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:26.695\nis step back from those situations,\nlike that wise old woman,\n\n00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.751\nlook at the situation through fresh eyes\n\n00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.712\nand come up with an 18th camel.\n\n00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.597\nFinding that 18th camel\nin the world's conflicts\n\n00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.779\nhas been my life passion.\n\n00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:39.934\nI basically see humanity\na bit like those three brothers.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.548\nWe're all one family.\n\n00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:44.052\nWe know that scientifically,\n\n00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:46.022\nthanks to the communications revolution,\n\n00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:49.614\nall the tribes on the planet --\nall 15,000 tribes --\n\n00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:51.249\nare in touch with each other.\n\n00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.634\nAnd it's a big family reunion.\n\n00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:56.340\nAnd yet, like many family reunions,\n\n00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:58.587\nit's not all peace and light.\n\n00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.512\nThere's a lot of conflict,\n\n00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:03.934\nand the question is:\nHow do we deal with our differences?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.054\nHow do we deal with\nour deepest differences,\n\n00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:08.787\ngiven the human propensity for conflict\n\n00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:13.338\nand the human genius at devising\nweapons of enormous destruction?\n\n00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:15.111\nThat's the question.\n\n00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.934\nAs I've spent the last better part\nof three decades, almost four,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.013\ntraveling the world,\n\n00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:25.406\ntrying to work, getting\ninvolved in conflicts\n\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.810\nranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East\n\n00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.558\nto Chechnya to Venezuela --\n\n00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:33.655\nsome of the most difficult conflicts\non the face of the planet --\n\n00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.770\nI've been asking myself that question.\n\n00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:39.190\nAnd I think I've found, in some ways,\nwhat is the secret to peace.\n\n00:02:39.214 --> 00:02:41.934\nIt's actually surprisingly simple.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.134\nIt's not easy, but it's simple.\n\n00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:46.389\nIt's not even new.\n\n00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:49.787\nIt may be one of our most\nancient human heritages.\n\n00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:52.128\nThe secret to peace is us.\n\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.762\nIt's us who act as a surrounding\ncommunity around any conflict,\n\n00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.934\nwho can play a constructive role.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nLet me give you just a story, an example.\n\n00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:05.054\nAbout 20 years ago,\n\n00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:08.319\nI was in South Africa,\nworking with the parties in that conflict,\n\n00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:09.606\nand I had an extra month,\n\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.196\nso I spent some time living\nwith several groups of San Bushmen.\n\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.164\nI was curious about them, about the way\nin which they resolve conflict.\n\n00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:21.934\nBecause, after all, within living memory,\nthey were hunters and gatherers,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.314\nliving pretty much\nlike our ancestors lived\n\n00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:26.600\nfor maybe 99 percent of the human story.\n\n00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:30.534\nAnd all the men have these poison arrows\nthat they use for hunting --\n\n00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:32.076\nabsolutely fatal.\n\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.394\nSo how do they deal\nwith their differences?\n\n00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:39.007\nWell, what I learned is, whenever\ntempers rise in those communities,\n\n00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.602\nsomeone goes and hides\nthe poison arrows out in the bush,\n\n00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:46.261\nand then everyone sits around\nin a circle like this,\n\n00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.237\nand they sit and they talk and they talk.\n\n00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.572\nIt may take two days,\nthree days, four days,\n\n00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:54.934\nbut they don't rest\nuntil they find a resolution\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.934\nor better yet -- a reconciliation.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.991\nAnd if tempers are still too high,\n\n00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:01.554\nthen they send someone\noff to visit some relatives,\n\n00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:02.934\nas a cooling-off period.\n\n00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:06.341\nWell, that system is, I think,\nprobably the system\n\n00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:08.101\nthat kept us alive to this point,\n\n00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.934\ngiven our human tendencies.\n\n00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.990\nThat system, I call \"the third side.\"\n\n00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:17.133\nBecause if you think about it,\nnormally when we think of conflict,\n\n00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.308\nwhen we describe it,\n\n00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:19.705\nthere's always two sides --\n\n00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.435\nit's Arabs versus Israelis,\nlabor versus management,\n\n00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.610\nhusband versus wife,\nRepublicans versus Democrats.\n\n00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:27.419\nBut what we don't often see\n\n00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:29.809\nis that there's always a third side,\n\n00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:33.505\nand the third side of the conflict is us,\nit's the surrounding community,\n\n00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:34.934\nit's the friends, the allies,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.766\nthe family members, the neighbors.\n\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.718\nAnd we can play\nan incredibly constructive role.\n\n00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:44.993\nPerhaps the most fundamental way\nin which the third side can help\n\n00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:47.934\nis to remind the parties\nof what's really at stake.\n\n00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:50.798\nFor the sake of the kids,\nfor the sake of the family,\n\n00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:53.592\nfor the sake of the community,\nfor the sake of the future,\n\n00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:56.057\nlet's stop fighting for a moment\nand start talking.\n\n00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:58.239\nBecause, the thing is,\n\n00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.836\nwhen we're involved in conflict,\n\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.419\nit's very easy to lose perspective.\n\n00:05:02.443 --> 00:05:04.482\nIt's very easy to react.\n\n00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:07.379\nHuman beings -- we're reaction machines.\n\n00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:08.776\nAnd as the saying goes,\n\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.323\nwhen angry, you will make the best speech\n\n00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:12.832\nyou will ever regret.\n\n00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:14.514\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:17.534\nAnd so the third side reminds us of that.\n\n00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:19.583\nThe third side helps us go to the balcony,\n\n00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:22.313\nwhich is a metaphor\nfor a place of perspective,\n\n00:05:22.337 --> 00:05:24.743\nwhere we can keep our eyes on the prize.\n\n00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:28.347\nLet me tell you a little story\nfrom my own negotiating experience.\n\n00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:33.442\nSome years ago, I was involved\nas a facilitator in some very tough talks\n\n00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.689\nbetween the leaders of Russia\nand the leaders of Chechnya.\n\n00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:39.364\nThere was a war going on, as you know.\n\n00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:42.934\nAnd we met in the Hague,\nin the Peace Palace,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:48.065\nin the same room where the Yugoslav\nwar-crimes tribunal was taking place.\n\n00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.961\nAnd the talks got off\nto a rather rocky start\n\n00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:54.393\nwhen the vice president of Chechnya\nbegan by pointing at the Russians\n\n00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:56.934\nand said, \"You should stay\nright here in your seats,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.769\nbecause you're going\nto be on trial for war crimes.\"\n\n00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.603\nAnd then he turned to me and said,\n\n00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:02.809\n\"You're an American.\n\n00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:06.059\nLook at what you Americans\nare doing in Puerto Rico.\"\n\n00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:09.706\nAnd my mind started racing, \"Puerto Rico?\nWhat do I know about Puerto Rico?\"\n\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.882\nI started reacting.\n\n00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:11.907\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.767\nBut then, I tried to remember\nto go to the balcony.\n\n00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.989\nAnd then when he paused\n\n00:06:16.013 --> 00:06:18.094\nand everyone looked at me for a response,\n\n00:06:18.118 --> 00:06:21.496\nfrom a balcony perspective,\nI was able to thank him for his remarks\n\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.297\nand say, \"I appreciate\nyour criticism of my country\n\n00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.768\nand I take it as a sign\nthat we're among friends\n\n00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:28.683\nand can speak candidly to one another.\"\n\n00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:29.708\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:33.113\n\"And what we're here to do is not\nto talk about Puerto Rico or the past.\n\n00:06:33.137 --> 00:06:35.318\nWe're here to see\nif we can figure out a way\n\n00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:37.934\nto stop the suffering\nand the bloodshed in Chechnya.\"\n\n00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:41.124\nThe conversation got back on track.\n\n00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:42.807\nThat's the role of the third side,\n\n00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.912\nto help the parties go to the balcony.\n\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.007\nNow let me take you, for a moment,\n\n00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.096\nto what's widely regarded as the world's\nmost difficult conflict,\n\n00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.661\nor the most impossible conflict,\nthe Middle East.\n\n00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:56.934\nQuestion is: where's the third side there?\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.122\nHow could we possibly go to the balcony?\n\n00:06:59.463 --> 00:07:03.440\nNow, I don't pretend to have an answer\nto the Middle East conflict,\n\n00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:07.424\nbut I think I've got a first step --\nliterally, a first step --\n\n00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:10.435\nsomething that any one of us\ncould do as third-siders.\n\n00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:12.666\nLet me just ask you one question first.\n\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.683\nHow many of you in the last years\n\n00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.742\nhave ever found yourself\nworrying about the Middle East\n\n00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:21.518\nand wondering what anyone could do?\n\n00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.659\nJust out of curiosity, how many of you?\n\n00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:26.175\nOK, so the great majority of us.\n\n00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:28.279\nAnd here, it's so far away.\n\n00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:31.219\nWhy do we pay so much attention\nto this conflict?\n\n00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:32.934\nIs it the number of deaths?\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.355\nThere are a hundred times more people\nwho die in a conflict in Africa\n\n00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.530\nthan in the Middle East.\n\n00:07:37.554 --> 00:07:39.641\nNo, it's because of the story,\n\n00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:43.373\nbecause we feel personally\ninvolved in that story.\n\n00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:47.226\nWhether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,\nreligious or non-religious,\n\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.123\nwe feel we have a personal stake in it.\n\n00:07:49.147 --> 00:07:50.298\nStories matter;\n\n00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:52.080\nas an anthropologist, I know that.\n\n00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:55.722\nStories are what we use\nto transmit knowledge.\n\n00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.267\nThey give meaning to our lives.\n\n00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.988\nThat's what we tell here\nat TED, we tell stories.\n\n00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.166\nStories are the key.\n\n00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.761\nAnd so my question is --\n\n00:08:04.428 --> 00:08:08.604\nyes, let's try and resolve the politics\nthere in the Middle East,\n\n00:08:08.628 --> 00:08:11.152\nbut let's also take a look at the story.\n\n00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:13.620\nLet's try to get at the root\nof what it's all about.\n\n00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:15.864\nLet's see if we can apply\nthe third side to it.\n\n00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:18.692\nWhat would that mean?\nWhat is the story there?\n\n00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:22.934\nNow, as anthropologists, we know\nthat every culture has an origin story.\n\n00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:25.555\nWhat's the origin story\nof the Middle East?\n\n00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:26.934\nIn a phrase, it's:\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.549\nFour thousand years ago,\n\n00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:32.563\na man and his family walked\nacross the Middle East,\n\n00:08:32.587 --> 00:08:35.158\nand the world has never\nbeen the same since.\n\n00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:38.204\nThat man, of course, was Abraham.\n\n00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:42.934\nAnd what he stood for was unity,\nthe unity of the family;\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.934\nhe's the father of us all.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.947\nBut it's not just what he stood for,\nit's what his message was.\n\n00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:49.934\nHis basic message was unity too,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.168\nthe interconnectedness of it all,\nthe unity of it all.\n\n00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:56.502\nAnd his basic value was respect,\n\n00:08:56.526 --> 00:08:58.394\nwas kindness toward strangers.\n\n00:08:58.418 --> 00:09:01.435\nThat's what he's known for,\nhis hospitality.\n\n00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:03.633\nSo in that sense,\n\n00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:07.617\nhe's the symbolic third side\nof the Middle East.\n\n00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:12.064\nHe's the one who reminds us\nthat we're all part of a greater whole.\n\n00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:15.698\nNow, think about that for a moment.\n\n00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:18.820\nToday, we face the scourge of terrorism.\n\n00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:20.527\nWhat is terrorism?\n\n00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:24.365\nTerrorism is basically\ntaking an innocent stranger\n\n00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:28.934\nand treating them as an enemy\nwhom you kill in order to create fear.\n\n00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:31.347\nWhat's the opposite of terrorism?\n\n00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:33.654\nIt's taking an innocent stranger\n\n00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:38.065\nand treating them as a friend\nwhom you welcome into your home,\n\n00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:40.781\nin order to sow and create understanding\n\n00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:42.593\nor respect, or love.\n\n00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:48.211\nSo what if, then, you took\nthe story of Abraham,\n\n00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:49.868\nwhich is a third-side story,\n\n00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:51.934\nwhat if that could be --\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.279\nbecause Abraham stands for hospitality --\n\n00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.517\nwhat if that could be\nan antidote to terrorism?\n\n00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.363\nWhat if that could be a vaccine\nagainst religious intolerance?\n\n00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:04.934\nHow would you bring that story to life?\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.720\nNow, it's not enough just to tell a story.\n\n00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:11.138\nThat's powerful, but people need\nto experience the story.\n\n00:10:11.162 --> 00:10:13.116\nThey need to be able to live the story.\n\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.416\nHow would you do that?\n\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.934\nAnd that was my thinking\nof how would you do that.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.101\nAnd that's what comes\nto the first step here.\n\n00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.848\nBecause the simple way to do that is:\n\n00:10:21.872 --> 00:10:23.657\nyou go for a walk.\n\n00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:27.096\nYou go for a walk\nin the footsteps of Abraham.\n\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.048\nYou retrace the footsteps of Abraham.\n\n00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:32.981\nBecause walking has a real power.\n\n00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:36.425\nYou know, as an anthropologist,\nwalking is what made us human.\n\n00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:40.644\nIt's funny -- when you walk,\nyou walk side-by-side,\n\n00:10:40.668 --> 00:10:42.934\nin the same common direction.\n\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.371\nNow if I were to come to you face-to-face\n\n00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.641\nand come this close to you,\n\n00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:51.064\nyou would feel threatened.\n\n00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:53.730\nBut if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,\n\n00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:55.635\neven touching shoulders,\n\n00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.934\nit's no problem.\n\n00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:58.934\nWho fights while they walk?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.934\nThat's why in negotiations,\noften, when things get tough,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.353\npeople go for walks in the woods.\n\n00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:09.799\nSo the idea came to me\nof, what about inspiring a path,\n\n00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:13.461\na route -- think the Silk Route,\nthink the Appalachian Trail --\n\n00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:17.711\nthat followed in the footsteps of Abraham?\n\n00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:19.560\nPeople said, \"That's crazy. You can't.\n\n00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:22.596\nYou can't retrace the footsteps\nof Abraham -- it's too insecure,\n\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.478\nyou've got to cross all these borders,\n\n00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:27.184\nit goes across 10 different countries\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:28.605\nbecause it unites them all.\"\n\n00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:30.884\nAnd so we studied the idea at Harvard.\n\n00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:32.138\nWe did our due diligence.\n\n00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:33.361\nAnd then a few years ago,\n\n00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:36.115\na group of us, about 25 of us\nfrom 10 different countries,\n\n00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:39.319\ndecided to see if we could retrace\nthe footsteps of Abraham,\n\n00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:41.843\ngoing from his initial birthplace\nin the city of Urfa\n\n00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.038\nin Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.\n\n00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:47.506\nAnd we then took a bus and took some walks\n\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.687\nand went to Harran, where, in the Bible,\nhe sets off on his journey.\n\n00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.264\nThen we crossed the border\ninto Syria, went to Aleppo,\n\n00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:56.636\nwhich, turns out, is named after Abraham.\n\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.934\nWe went to Damascus,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.702\nwhich has a long history\nassociated with Abraham.\n\n00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:03.488\nWe then came to Northern Jordan,\n\n00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:08.538\nto Jerusalem -- which is all\nabout Abraham -- to Bethlehem,\n\n00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:11.933\nand finally, to the place\nwhere he's buried, in Hebron.\n\n00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:14.240\nSo effectively, we went from womb to tomb.\n\n00:12:14.264 --> 00:12:15.565\nWe showed it could be done.\n\n00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:16.958\nIt was an amazing journey.\n\n00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:18.934\nLet me ask you a question.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:23.321\nHow many of you have had the experience\nof being in a strange neighborhood\n\n00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.561\nor strange land,\n\n00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.750\nand a total stranger, perfect stranger,\n\n00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:31.496\ncomes up to you\nand shows you some kindness --\n\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.019\nmaybe invites you into their home,\ngives you a drink,\n\n00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:35.822\ngives you a coffee, gives you a meal?\n\n00:12:35.846 --> 00:12:38.016\nHow many of you have ever\nhad that experience?\n\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.831\nThat's the essence of the Abraham Path.\n\n00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:44.372\nThat's what you discover as you go\ninto these villages in the Middle East\n\n00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.731\nwhere you expect hostility,\n\n00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:48.302\nand you get the most amazing hospitality,\n\n00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:49.735\nall associated with Abraham:\n\n00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:53.519\n\"In the name of Father Ibrahim,\nlet me offer you some food.\"\n\n00:12:53.543 --> 00:12:54.726\nSo what we discovered\n\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.958\nis that Abraham is not just a figure\nout of a book for those people;\n\n00:12:57.982 --> 00:13:01.138\nhe's alive, he's a living presence.\n\n00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:03.289\nAnd to make a long story short,\n\n00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:05.375\nin the last couple of years now,\n\n00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:10.235\nthousands of people have begun to walk\nparts of the path of Abraham\n\n00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:11.592\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:14.671\nenjoying the hospitality\nof the people there.\n\n00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:17.934\nThey've begun to walk\nin Israel and Palestine,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.678\nin Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.\n\n00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:22.011\nIt's an amazing experience.\n\n00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.320\nMen, women, young people, old people --\n\n00:13:24.344 --> 00:13:27.175\nmore women than men,\nactually, interestingly.\n\n00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:29.134\nFor those who can't walk,\n\n00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:31.673\nwho are unable to get there right now,\n\n00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:35.317\npeople started to organize walks\nin cities, in their own communities.\n\n00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.715\nIn Cincinnati, for instance,\nthey organized a walk\n\n00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:41.581\nfrom a church to a mosque to a synagogue\nand all had an Abrahamic meal together.\n\n00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:43.067\nIt was Abraham Path Day.\n\n00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:45.497\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil,\nit's become an annual event\n\n00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:49.349\nfor thousands of people to run\nin a virtual Abraham Path Run,\n\n00:13:49.373 --> 00:13:51.144\nuniting the different communities.\n\n00:13:51.168 --> 00:13:54.148\nThe media love it; they really adore it.\n\n00:13:54.172 --> 00:13:57.626\nThey lavish attention on it\nbecause it's visual\n\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.314\nand it spreads the idea,\n\n00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:03.720\nthis idea of Abrahamic hospitality,\nof kindness towards strangers.\n\n00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:07.934\nAnd just a couple weeks ago,\nthere was an NPR story on it.\n\n00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:09.715\nLast month,\n\n00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:15.656\nthere was a piece\nin the Manchester Guardian about it,\n\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.545\ntwo whole pages.\n\n00:14:18.307 --> 00:14:21.527\nAnd they quoted a villager\n\n00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:24.638\nwho said, \"This walk connects\nus to the world.\"\n\n00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:27.479\nHe said, \"It was like a light\nthat went on in our lives --\n\n00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:28.934\nit brought us hope.\"\n\n00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:31.476\nAnd so that's what it's about.\n\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.306\nBut it's not just about psychology;\n\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.806\nit's about economics.\n\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.934\nBecause as people walk, they spend money.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.934\nAnd this woman right here, Um Ahmad,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.108\nis a woman who lives on the path\nin Northern Jordan.\n\n00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:45.934\nShe's desperately poor.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.603\nShe's partially blind,\nher husband can't work,\n\n00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:51.579\nshe's got seven kids.\n\n00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:53.934\nBut what she can do is cook.\n\n00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:57.170\nAnd so she's begun to cook\nfor some groups of walkers\n\n00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:00.798\nwho come through the village\nand have a meal in her home.\n\n00:15:00.822 --> 00:15:04.122\nThey sit on the floor --\nshe doesn't even have a tablecloth.\n\n00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:05.934\nShe makes the most delicious food,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.080\nthat's fresh from the herbs\nin the surrounding countryside.\n\n00:15:09.104 --> 00:15:11.231\nAnd so more and more walkers have come,\n\n00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:15.149\nand lately she's begun to earn an income\nto support her family.\n\n00:15:15.173 --> 00:15:18.050\nAnd so she told our team there, she said,\n\n00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:21.240\n\"You have made me visible\n\n00:15:21.264 --> 00:15:24.934\nin a village where people\nwere once ashamed to look at me.\"\n\n00:15:25.713 --> 00:15:27.934\nThat's the potential of the Abraham Path.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.720\nThere are literally hundreds\nof those kinds of communities\n\n00:15:30.744 --> 00:15:33.210\nacross the Middle East, across the path.\n\n00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:37.060\nThe potential is basically\nto change the game.\n\n00:15:37.417 --> 00:15:41.123\nAnd to change the game, you have to change\nthe frame, the way we see things --\n\n00:15:41.147 --> 00:15:46.465\nto change the frame\nfrom hostility to hospitality,\n\n00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.934\nfrom terrorism to tourism.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.695\nAnd in that sense, the Abraham Path\n\n00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:53.330\nis a game-changer.\n\n00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:55.623\nLet me just show you one thing.\n\n00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:57.257\nI have a little acorn here\n\n00:15:57.281 --> 00:16:00.768\nthat I picked up while I was walking\non the path earlier this year.\n\n00:16:01.324 --> 00:16:04.171\nNow, the acorn is associated\nwith the oak tree, of course --\n\n00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:07.273\ngrows into an oak tree,\nwhich is associated with Abraham.\n\n00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:09.240\nThe path right now is like an acorn;\n\n00:16:09.264 --> 00:16:10.934\nit's still in its early phase.\n\n00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:13.271\nWhat would the oak tree look like?\n\n00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:14.934\nWhen I think back to my childhood,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.911\na good part of which I spent,\nafter being born here in Chicago,\n\n00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.290\nI spent in Europe.\n\n00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:26.475\nIf you had been in the ruins of, say,\nLondon in 1945, or Berlin,\n\n00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:27.698\nand you had said,\n\n00:16:27.722 --> 00:16:29.405\n\"Sixty years from now,\n\n00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:32.754\nthis is going to be the most peaceful,\nprosperous part of the planet,\"\n\n00:16:32.778 --> 00:16:36.092\npeople would have thought\nyou were certifiably insane.\n\n00:16:36.116 --> 00:16:39.934\nBut they did it, thanks\nto a common identity, Europe,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.934\nand a common economy.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.267\nSo my question is,\nif it can be done in Europe,\n\n00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:46.934\nwhy not in the Middle East?\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:51.645\nWhy not, thanks to a common identity,\nwhich is the story of Abraham,\n\n00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:56.363\nand thanks to a common economy that\nwould be based, in good part, on tourism?\n\n00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:59.355\nSo let me conclude, then,\n\n00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:02.728\nby saying that in the last 35 years,\n\n00:17:02.752 --> 00:17:05.169\nas I've worked\nin some of the most dangerous,\n\n00:17:05.193 --> 00:17:08.120\ndifficult and intractable conflicts\naround the planet,\n\n00:17:08.144 --> 00:17:13.749\nI have yet to see one conflict\nthat I felt could not be transformed.\n\n00:17:14.296 --> 00:17:16.149\nIt's not easy, of course.\n\n00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:17.934\nBut it's possible.\n\n00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:20.364\nIt was done in South Africa.\n\n00:17:20.388 --> 00:17:22.273\nIt was done in Northern Ireland.\n\n00:17:22.297 --> 00:17:23.814\nIt could be done anywhere.\n\n00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:26.464\nIt simply depends on us.\n\n00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:29.340\nIt depends on us taking the third side.\n\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.492\nSo let me invite you to consider\ntaking the third side,\n\n00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:35.182\neven as a very small step.\n\n00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:37.428\nWe're about to take a break in a moment.\n\n00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:39.429\nJust go up to someone\n\n00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:42.096\nwho's from a different culture,\na different country,\n\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.475\na different ethnicity --\nsome difference --\n\n00:17:44.499 --> 00:17:46.136\nand engage them in a conversation.\n\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.394\nListen to them.\n\n00:17:47.418 --> 00:17:48.934\nThat's a third-side act.\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.242\nThat's walking Abraham's Path.\n\n00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:52.791\nAfter a TED Talk,\n\n00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:54.264\nwhy not a TED Walk?\n\n00:17:54.288 --> 00:17:55.709\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:59.896\nSo let me just leave you\nwith three things.\n\n00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.629\nOne is, the secret to peace\nis the third side.\n\n00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:07.764\nThe third side is us.\n\n00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:11.359\nEach of us, with a single step,\n\n00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.103\ncan take the world, can bring the world\n\n00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:16.033\na step closer to peace.\n\n00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.332\nThere's an old African proverb that goes:\n\n00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:21.522\n\"When spiderwebs unite,\n\n00:18:21.546 --> 00:18:24.109\nthey can halt even the lion.\"\n\n00:18:24.628 --> 00:18:28.903\nIf we're able to unite\nour third-side webs of peace,\n\n00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:31.935\nwe can even halt the lion of war.\n\n00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:33.110\nThank you very much.\n\n00:18:33.134 --> 00:18:36.453\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why not eat insects?", "duration": "994", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marcel_dicke_why_not_eat_insects", "transcript": "Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets. And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects? That's quite a lot. (Laughter) But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. (Laughter) Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects. But this is quite good.Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects? Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. And here you see just a selection. There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species. There's a few hundreds of mammals \u2014 six million species of insects. In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers. In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs. But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects. Insects are not only there in nature, but they also are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing.There was an estimation, a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year. It's a number \u2014 very large \u2014 a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. It was 80 billion U.S. dollars. Well we know that that was not a cheap war. So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing. And not only in the States, but in any country, in any economy.What do they do? They remove dung, they pollinate our crops. A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. They control pests, and they're food for animals. They're at the start of food chains. Small animals eat insects. Even larger animals eat insects. But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals. And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang \u2014 about two million inhabitants. If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat. And they prepare it in a wonderful way. And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars, locusts, bee pupae \u2014 delicacies. And you can eat something new everyday. There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep. More than 1,000 species \u2014 an enormous variety. And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception. You're eating at least 500 grams per year. What are you eating? Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles \u2014 any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. Some fruits get some insect damage. Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup. If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery. And that's your view of a tomato. But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup, and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency, there can be all kinds of things in there, no problem. In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway? (Laughter) In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. So anything is a good protein source already.Now you may say, \"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident.\" We're even doing this on purpose. In a lot of food items that we have \u2014 I have only two items here on the slide \u2014 pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari \u2014 a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business. One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros. One gram of gold is 30 euros. So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods.Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth. The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. Where, at the moment, we have something between six and seven billion people, it will grow to about nine billion in 2050. That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people. There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. How are we going to feed this world? And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent. And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game. And we eat quite a lot of it. In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year. In the developing world it's much lower. It's 25 kilograms per person per year. But it's increasing enormously. In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing. So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat. And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them. They have the same share that we have.Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. We could do with much, much less \u2014 and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time, and you can easily do without anything. You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production, and we're being faced with that more and more often. The first problem that we're facing is human health. Pigs are quite like us. They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. That means that pigs also share diseases with us. And a pig disease, a pig virus, and a human virus can both proliferate, and because of their kind of reproduction, they can combine and produce a new virus. This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak. You get a new disease that can be deadly. We eat insects \u2014 they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. So that's one point for insects.(Laughter)And there's the conversion factor. You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do? With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output. So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output. We're not taking the bonus yet. We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. So that's two points for insects.(Laughter)And there's the environment. If we take 10 kilograms of food \u2014 (Laughter) and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure. If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. So less waste. Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. So that's three points for insects.(Laughter)Now there's a big \"if,\" of course, and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good. In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. And even in terms of calories, it is very good. One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs. So that's four points for insects.(Laughter)I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this. So the question is, why not eat insects? I gave you at least four arguments in favor. We'll have to. Even if you don't like it, you'll have to get used to this because at the moment, 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests, but there's a limitation very soon. And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way. We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects. And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority \u2014 in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere. On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy. It's just very good food. You can vary enormously. It has many benefits.In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price. Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp? There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related. They are delicacies. In fact, a locust is a \"shrimp\" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet. So why are we not eating insects yet? Well that's just a matter of mindset. We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. That's why we're changing the perception of insects. And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis, in telling people what insects are, what magnificent things they are, what magnificent jobs they do in nature. And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well. If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.(Laughter)So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. And some might think, well they're not yet available. Well they are. There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them, and one of them is here in the audience, Marian Peeters, who's in the picture. I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets \u2014 not visible, but as animal protein in the food. And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. A Dutch chocolate maker. (Music) (Applause) So there's even a lot of design to it.(Laughter)Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. over to the Hague recently, she went to a high-class restaurant, and they ate insects all together. It's not something that is a hobby of mine. It's really taken off the ground. So why not eat insects? You should try it yourself. A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news. I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing.So you can try it yourself today, and I would say, enjoy. And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries, and he can have the first bite.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually. And it looks delicious.

come at much larger numbers.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nIn fact, of all animals on Earth,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nof all animal species,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\n80 percent

00:01:39.958\nusually without us knowing.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nThere was an estimation,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\na conservative estimation, a couple of years ago\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthat the U.S. economy\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbenefited by 57 billion\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\ndollars per year.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nIt's a number -- very large --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\na contribution to the economy of the United States for free.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd so I looked up what the economy was paying\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nfor the war in Iraq\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nin the same year.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nIt was 80 billion U.S. dollars.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWell we know that that\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwas not a cheap war.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nSo insects, just for free,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\ncontribute to the economy of the United States\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwith about the same order of magnitude,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\njust for free, without everyone knowing.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd not only in the States,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nbut in any country, in any economy.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWhat do they do?\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThey remove dung, they pollinate our crops.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nA third of all the fruits that we eat\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nare all a result\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nof insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey control pests,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand they're food for animals.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThey're at the start of food chains.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSmall animals eat insects.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nEven larger animals eat insects.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nBut the small animals that eat insects\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare being eaten by larger animals,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nstill larger animals.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThere's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd here you see me\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nin a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nabout two million inhabitants.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nIf you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwhere you can select which fish you want to eat,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nyou can select which insects you would like to eat.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd they prepare it in a wonderful way.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd here you see me enjoying a meal\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwith caterpillars, locusts,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbee pupae -- delicacies.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd you can eat something new everyday.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThere's more than 1,000 species of insects\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthat are being eaten all around the globe.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThat's quite a bit more\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthan just a few mammals that we're eating,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nlike a cow or a pig\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nor a sheep.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nMore than 1,000 species --\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nan enormous variety.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd now you may think, okay,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nin this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nWell we've seen already that quite some of you\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nalready ate insects maybe occasionally,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut I can tell you that every one of you\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nis eating insects, without any exception.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nYou're eating at least\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\n500 grams per year.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nWhat are you eating?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nTomato soup, peanut butter,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nchocolate, noodles --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nany processed food that you're eating\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ncontains insects,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nbecause insects are here all around us,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand when they're out there in nature\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthey're also in our crops.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSome fruits get some insect damage.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThose are the fruits, if they're tomato,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat go to the tomato soup.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIf they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd that's your view of a tomato.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand as long as they meet\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthe requirements of the food agency,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthere can be all kinds of things in there,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nno problem.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIn fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthere's meat in there anyway?\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nIn fact, all our processed foods\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\ncontain more proteins\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthan we would be aware of.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSo anything is a good protein source already.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nNow you may say,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\n\"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident.\"\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWe're even doing this on purpose.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIn a lot of food items that we have --\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nI have only two items\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nhere on the slide --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\npink cookies or surimi sticks\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nor, if you like, Campari --\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\na lot of our food products that are of a red color\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nare dyed with a natural dye.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThe surimi sticks\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\n[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nis white fish\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthat's being dyed with cochineal.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nCochineal is a product\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nof an insect that lives off these cacti.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nIt's being produced in large amounts,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n150 to 180 metric tons per year\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nin the Canary Islands in Peru,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand it's big business.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nOne gram of cochineal\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\ncosts about 30 euros.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nOne gram of gold\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nis 30 euros.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nSo it's a very precious thing\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat we're using to dye our foods.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nNow the situation in the world is going to change\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nfor you and me, for everyone on this Earth.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe human population is growing very rapidly\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand is growing exponentially.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nWhere, at the moment, we have\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nsomething between six and seven billion people,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nit will grow to about nine billion\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nin 2050.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThat means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand this is something that worries more and more people.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThere was an FAO conference last October\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat was completely devoted to this.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nHow are we going to feed this world?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd if you look at the figures up there,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nit says that we have a third more mouths to feed,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nbut we need an agricultural production increase\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nof 70 percent.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd that's especially because this world population\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nis increasing,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand it's increasing, not only in numbers,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut we're also getting wealthier,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand also starts to eat more meat.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd meat, in fact, is something\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat costs a lot\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nof our agricultural production.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nOur diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand at the moment, most of us here\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nget it from livestock,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nfrom fish, from game.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd we eat quite a lot of it.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIn the developed world it's on average\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n80 kilograms per person per year,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhich goes up to 120\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nin the United States\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand a bit lower in some other countries,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nbut on average 80 kilograms\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nper person per year.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIn the developing world it's much lower.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nIt's 25 kilograms per person per year.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut it's increasing enormously.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIn China in the last 20 years,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nit increased from 20 to 50,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand it's still increasing.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo if a third of the world population\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nis going to increase its meat consumption\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nfrom 25 to 80 on average,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand a third of the world population\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nis living in China and in India,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwe're having an enormous demand on meat.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd of course, we are not there to say\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat's only for us, it's not for them.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThey have the same share that we have.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nNow to start with, I should say\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat we are eating way too much meat\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin the Western world.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWe could do with much, much less --\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand you can easily do without anything.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nYou'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut then there's a lot of problems\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nthat come with meat production,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand we're being faced with that more and more often.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThe first problem that we're facing is human health.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nPigs are quite like us.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThey're even models in medicine,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThat means that pigs also share diseases with us.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd a pig disease,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\na pig virus, and a human virus\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ncan both proliferate,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand because of their kind of reproduction,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthey can combine and produce a new virus.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nduring the classical swine fever outbreak.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nYou get a new disease that can be deadly.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nWe eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthat this doesn't happen.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nSo that's one point for insects.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd there's the conversion factor.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nYou take 10 kilograms of feed,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nyou can get one kilogram of beef,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nSo if you would be an entrepreneur,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhat would you do?\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nWith 10 kilograms of input,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nyou can get either one or nine kg. of output.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo far we're taking\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe one, or up to five kilograms of output.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWe're not taking the bonus yet.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWe're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo that's two points for insects.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd there's the environment.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIf we take 10 kilograms of food --\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand it results in one kilogram of beef,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe other nine kilograms are waste,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand a lot of that is manure.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIf you produce insects, you have less manure\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nper kilogram of meat that you produce.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo less waste.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nFurthermore, per kilogram of manure,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nyou have much, much less ammonia\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand fewer greenhouse gases\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhen you have insect manure\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthan when you have cow manure.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo you have less waste,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nand the waste that you have is not as environmental malign\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nas it is with cow dung.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo that's three points for insects.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nNow there's a big \"if,\" of course,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand it is if insects produce meat\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthat is of good quality.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWell there have been all kinds of analyses\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nit's very good.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIn fact, it's comparable\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nto anything we eat as meat at the moment.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd even in terms of calories, it is very good.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOne kilogram of grasshoppers\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nhas the same amount of calories\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nas 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo that's four points for insects.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI can go on,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand I could make many more points for insects,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbut time doesn't allow this.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSo the question is, why not eat insects?\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nI gave you at least four arguments in favor.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe'll have to.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nEven if you don't like it,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nyou'll have to get used to this\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nbecause at the moment,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\n70 percent of all our agricultural land\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nis being used to produce livestock.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThat's not only the land\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhere the livestock is walking and feeding,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nbut it's also other areas\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhere the feed is being produced and being transported.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nWe can increase it a bit\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nat the expense of rainforests,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nbut there's a limitation very soon.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd if you remember that we need to increase\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nagricultural production by 70 percent,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwe're not going to make it that way.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe could much better change\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nfrom meat, from beef,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto insects.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd then 80 percent of the world\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nalready eats insects,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nso we are just a minority --\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nin a country like the U.K., the USA,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthe Netherlands, anywhere.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nOn the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwhere they have abundantly present\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nall kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nOn the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo people there are eating them,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nnot because they're hungry,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut because they think it's a delicacy.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nIt's just very good food.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nYou can vary enormously.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIt has many benefits.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIn fact, we have delicacy\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nthat's very much like this grasshopper:\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nshrimps, a delicacy\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nbeing sold at a high price.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nWho wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThere are a few people who don't like shrimp,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nbut shrimp, or crabs,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nor crayfish,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nare very closely related.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThey are delicacies.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nIn fact, a locust is a \"shrimp\" of the land,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand it would make very good into our diet.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo why are we not eating insects yet?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nWell that's just a matter of mindset.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nWe're not used to it,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThat's why we're changing the perception of insects.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nin telling people what insects are,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nwhat magnificent things they are,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwhat magnificent jobs they do in nature.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd in fact, without insects,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwe would not be here in this room,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nbecause if the insects die out,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwe will soon die out as well.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nIf we die out, the insects will continue very happily.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd some might think, well they're not yet available.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWell they are.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThere are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand one of them is here in the audience,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nMarian Peeters, who's in the picture.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nnot visible, but as animal protein\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin the food.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd maybe by 2020,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nyou'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd they're being made in the most wonderful ways.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nA Dutch chocolate maker.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\n(Music)\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nSo there's even a lot of design to it.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWell in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand she puts the insects on the menu\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin her restaurant in her ministry.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nover to the Hague recently,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nshe went to a high-class restaurant,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nand they ate insects all together.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nIt's not something that is a hobby of mine.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nIt's really taken off the ground.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nSo why not eat insects?\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nYou should try it yourself.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nA couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nin a square in Wageningen town,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand they ate insects at the same moment,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nand this was still big, big news.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nI think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nbecause it's just a normal way of doing.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nSo you can try it yourself today,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand I would say, enjoy.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand he can have the first bite.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:16:03.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nBruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nMarcel Dicke: It's all protein.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nBG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd it looks delicious.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nThey just make it [with] nuts or something.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nMD: Thank you.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I taught rats to sniff out land mines", "duration": "731", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bart_weetjens_how_i_taught_rats_to_sniff_out_land_mines", "transcript": "I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. As a child, I had two passions. One was a passion for rodents. I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels. You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops. (Laughter) I also had a passion for Africa. Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity. Africa was truly fascinating for me.I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode. I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines. We're talking '95 now. Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true. As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land. Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world. We chose rats.Why would you choose rats? Because, aren't they vermin? Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures. And actually, our product \u2014 what you see here. There's a target somewhere here. You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. There, the animal finds a mine. It scratches on the soil. And the animal comes back for a food reward. Very, very simple. Very sustainable in this environment. Here, the animal gets its food reward. And that's how it works. Very, very simple.Now why would you use rats? Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments. Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. They're extremely sensitive to smell. Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. Now how do we communicate with rats? Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there. A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food \u2014 so click is food \u2014 we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds \u2014 five seconds, which is long for a rat. Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult. It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test. This consists of 400 square meters. There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field \u2014 just like dogs, by the way. Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog.This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up. But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal \u2014 two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down. Question of scale. If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger. We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines.But let me bring you to a very different problem. And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem. Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability. In Tanzania \u2014 the numbers don't lie \u2014 45 percent of people \u2014 T.B. patients \u2014 get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense. You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives.So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B. is \"tering,\" which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar. Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. So what we did is we collected some samples \u2014 just as a way of testing \u2014 from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there.So how does it work? You have a cassette with 10 samples. You put these 10 samples at once in the cage. An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast. Here it's already at the third sample. This is a positive sample. It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative. Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. A cage like this \u2014 (Applause) A cage like this \u2014 provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats \u2014 a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples. Can you imagine the potential offspring applications \u2014 environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.But let's stick first to tuberculosis. I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done. Microscopy for 1,800 patients. And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent. Throughout last year, we've been \u2014 depending on which intervals you take \u2014 we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent. So this is really considerable. Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. So, to standardize this. Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon. Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. This is in a prototype stage. We don't have a working system here yet.To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people. It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available. So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human. And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1019, "subtitle":

-\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nextraordinarily rewarding journey,\nactually -\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nwhich brought me into\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\ntraining rats\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nto save human lives\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nby detecting landmines\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nand tuberculosis.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nAs a child, I had two passions.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nOne was a passion for rodents.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nI had all kinds of rats,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nmice, hamsters,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\ngerbils, squirrels.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nYou name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI also had a passion for Africa.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nGrowing up in a multicultural environment,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwe had African students in the house,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand I learned about their stories,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nso different backgrounds,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\ndependency on imported know-how,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\ngoods, services,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nexuberant cultural diversity.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAfrica was truly fascinating for me.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nI became an industrial engineer,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nengineer in product development,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand I focused on appropriate detection technologies,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nactually the first appropriate technologies\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nfor developing countries.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nI started working in the industry,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nbut I wasn't really happy to contribute\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto a material consumer society\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nin a linear, extracting\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand manufacturing mode.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nI quit my job to focus on the real world problem:\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nlandmines.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nWe're talking '95 now.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nPrincess Diana is announcing on TV\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthat landmines form a structural barrier\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nto any development, which is really true.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAs long as these devices are there,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nor there is suspicion of landmines,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nyou can't really enter into the land.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nActually, there was an appeal worldwide\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nfor new detectors\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nsustainable in the environments\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwhere they're needed to produce,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhich is mainly in the developing world.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWe chose rats.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nWhy would you choose rats?\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nBecause, aren't they vermin?\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nWell, actually rats are,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nin contrary to what most people think about them,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nrats are highly sociable creatures.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd actually, our product -- what you see here.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThere's a target somewhere here.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nYou see an operator, a trained African\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwith his rats in front\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho actually are left and right.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThere, the animal finds a mine.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nIt scratches on the soil.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd the animal comes back for a food reward.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nVery, very simple.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nVery sustainable in this environment.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nHere, the animal gets its food reward.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd that's how it works.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nVery, very simple.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow why would you use rats?\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nRats have been used since the '50s last century,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nin all kinds of experiments.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nRats have more genetic material\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nallocated to olfaction\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthan any other mammal species.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nThey're extremely sensitive to smell.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nMoreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand to communicate about it.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow how do we communicate with rats?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nWell don't talk rat,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut we have a clicker,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\na standard method for animal training,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nwhich you see there.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nA clicker, which makes a particular sound\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwith which you can reinforce particular behaviors.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nFirst of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwhich is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nOnce the animal knows click, food,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nclick, food, click, food --\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nso click is food --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nwe bring it in a cage with a hole,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand actually the animal learns\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto stick the nose in the hole\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nunder which a target scent is placed,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand to do that for five seconds --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nfive seconds, which is long for a rat.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nOnce the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt learns how to find the target smell\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nin a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThen the animal learns\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nto walk on a leash in the open\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand find targets.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIn the next step, animals learn\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nto find real mines in real minefields.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThey are tested and accredited\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\naccording to International Mine Action Standards,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\njust like dogs have to pass a test.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThis consists of 400 square meters.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nThere's a number of mines\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nplaced blindly,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand the team of trainer and their rat\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nhave to find all the targets.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nIf the animal does that, it gets a license\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nas an accredited animal\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nto be operational in the field --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\njust like dogs, by the way.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nMaybe one slight difference:\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwe can train rats at a fifth of the price\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nof training the mining dog.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThis is our team in Mozambique:\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\none Tanzanian trainer,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwho transfers the skills\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nto these three Mozambican fellows.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThey have a skill,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich makes them much less dependent\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\non foreign aid.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nMoreover, this small team\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\ntogether with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nand the manual de-miners to follow-up.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nBut with this small investment in a rat capacity,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwe have demonstrated in Mozambique\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat we can reduce the cost-price per square meter\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nup to 60 percent\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nof what is currently normal --\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\ntwo dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand we can still bring that price down.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nQuestion of scale.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIf you can bring in more rats,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwe can actually make the output even bigger.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe have a demonstration site in Mozambique.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nEleven African governments\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nhave seen that they can become less dependent\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nby using this technology.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThey have signed the pact for peace\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand treaty in the Great Lakes region,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand they endorse hero rats\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto clear their common borders of landmines.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut let me bring you to a very different problem.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd there's about 6,000 people last year\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat walked on a landmine,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nbut worldwide last year,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nalmost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nas a first cause of infection.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nEspecially in Africa\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwhere T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthere is a huge common problem.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nMicroscopy, the standard WHO procedure,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nreaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nIn Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\n45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nget diagnosed with T.B. before they die.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nIt means that, if you have T.B.,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nyou have more chance that you won't be detected,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nbut will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd if, however,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nyou are detected very early, diagnosed early,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\ntreatment can start,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nYou can actually cure T.B.,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\neven in HIV-positives.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nSo in our common language, Dutch,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthe name for T.B.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nis \"tering,\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhich, etymologically,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nrefers to the smell of tar.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAlready the old Chinese\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand the Greek, Hippocrates,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhave actually published,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\ndocumented, that T.B. can be diagnosed\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nbased on the volatiles\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nexuding from patients.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nSo what we did is we collected some samples --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\njust as a way of testing --\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nfrom hospitals,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\ntrained rats on them\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand see if this works,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand wonder, well,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwe can reach 89 percent sensitivity,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n86 percent specificity\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nusing multiple rats in a row.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThis is how it works,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand really, this is a generic technology.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nWe're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nbut can you imagine,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nyou can actually put anything under there.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nSo how does it work?\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nYou have a cassette with 10 samples.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nYou put these 10 samples at once in the cage.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAn animal only needs two hundredths of a second\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nto discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nHere it's already at the third sample.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThis is a positive sample.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nIt gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd by doing so, very fast,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwe can have like a second-line opinion\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nto see which patients are positive,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nwhich are negative.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nJust as an indication,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhereas a microscopist can process\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\n40 samples in a day,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\na rat can process\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthe same amount of samples\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nin seven minutes only.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nA cage like this --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nA cage like this -- provided that you have rats,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand we have now currently\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\n25 tuberculosis rats --\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\na cage like this, operating throughout the day,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\ncan process 1,680 samples.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nCan you imagine the potential offspring applications --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nenvironmental detection\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nof pollutants in soils,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\ncustoms applications,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\ndetection of illicit goods in containers and so on.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nBut let's stick first to tuberculosis.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI just want to briefly highlight,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe blue rods\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nare the scores of microscopy only\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nat the five clinics in Dar es Salaam\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\non a population of 500,000 people,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhere 15,000 reported to get a test done.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nMicroscopy for 1,800 patients.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd by just presenting the samples once more to the rats\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand looping those results back,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwe were able to increase case detection rates\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nby over 30 percent.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThroughout last year,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwe've been -- depending on which intervals you take --\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwe've been consistently\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nincreasing case detection rates\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nin five hospitals in Dar es Salaam\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nbetween 30 and 40 percent.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo this is really considerable.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nKnowing that a missed patient by microscopy\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\ninfects up to 15 people,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nhealthy people, per year,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nyou can be sure\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthat we have saved lots of lives.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAt least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThe way forward for us\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nis now to standardize this technology.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd there are simple things\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nlike, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhere the animal has to stick for five seconds.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nSo, to standardize this.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAlso, to standardize the pellets,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthe food rewards,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand to semi-automate this\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nin order to replicate this on a much larger scale\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand affect the lives of many more people.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nTo conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nHere is a first prototype\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nof our camera rat,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwhich is a rat with a rat backpack\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwith a camera that can go under rubble\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto detect for victims\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nafter earthquake and so on.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThis is in a prototype stage.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nWe don't have a working system here yet.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nTo conclude, I would actually like to say,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nyou may think this is about rats, these projects,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbut in the end it is about people.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nIt is about empowering vulnerable communities\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nto tackle difficult, expensive\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand doing that with a local resource,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nplenty available.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nSo something completely different\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nis to keep on challenging your perception\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nabout the resources surrounding you,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhether they are environmental,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ntechnological, animal, or human.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd to respectfully harmonize with them\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nin order to foster a sustainable world.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A vision for sustainable restaurants", "duration": "529", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_potts_dawson_a_vision_for_sustainable_restaurants", "transcript": "Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today, 10 calories are taken to produce it. That's a lot. I want to take something rather humble to discuss. I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to. The humble potato \u2014 and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these. And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy. It grows and is nurtured. It's then harvested. It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue. It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me. I basically take it, prepare it, and then people consume it \u2014 hopefully they enjoy it. The last stage is basically waste, and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. There are different types of waste. There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy; and there's a waste of waste. And every business I've been working on over the past five years, I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. Basically a restaurant just like any other. This is the restaurant, Acorn House. Front and back. So let me run you through a few ideas. Floor: sustainable, recyclable. Chairs: recycled and recyclable. Tables: Forestry Commission. This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom \u2014 she didn't like sitting on it, so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale \u2014 reusing, a job that was pretty good. I hate waste, especially walls. If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products. The whole business is run on sustainable energy. This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. Paint is all low-volume chemical, which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. I was experimenting with these \u2014 I don't know if you can see it \u2014 but there's a work surface there. And that's a plastic polymer. And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature. But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers. Will they outlive me? They probably might. Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine. It actually looks better than a brand new one \u2014 so looking good there. Now reusing is vital. And we filter our own water. We put them in bottles, refrigerate them, and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. Here's a great little example. If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire, which has been turned inside out and sewn up. It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.This is the kitchen, which is in the same room. I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. It serves 220 people a day. We generate quite a lot of waste. This is the waste room. You can't get rid of waste. But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it. In here, I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator \u2014 turns food into an inner material, which I can store and then compost later.I compost it in this garden. All of the soil you can see there is basically my food, which is generated by the restaurant, and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. Three compost bins \u2014 go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week \u2014 really good, makes fantastic compost. A couple of wormeries in there too. And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. And I tried taking the dried food waste, putting it to the worms, going, \"There you go, dinner.\" It was like vegetable jerky, and killed all of them. I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you. (Laughter) What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. This takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds \u2014 this is going to be mint in there \u2014 and I sort of water the garden with it. And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.So, water is a very important aspect. I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great. I managed to do it. This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House \u2014 same chairs, same tables. They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. But this is an electrical restaurant. The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen. And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water. Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water. It literally is Waterhouse. The air handling system inside it \u2014 I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. This is basically air-handling. I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room. Very advanced, no air-conditioning \u2014 I love it. In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange. I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it. (Laughter) And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat \u2014 it's off-grid; it generates all its own power. He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.There's no accident in names of these restaurants. Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water; and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. I've got metal and earth to come. So you've got to watch your space for that. Okay. So this is my next project. Five weeks old, it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad. The People's Supermarket. So basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. So people \u2014 i.e., perhaps, more working-class \u2014 or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. This is a social enterprise, not-for-profit cooperative supermarket. It really is about the social disconnect between food, communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers \u2014 connecting communities in London to rural growers. Really important. So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk; I'm committing to leeks and broccoli \u2014 all very important stuff. I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors; I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges; I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys. I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. That's zero food waste. And no one's doing that just yet. In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching, let's have a go. Try it on. I'm going to get there before you.So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning, and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time, and it's an important statement to understand. If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food, think about the sustainable nature of it, then we may fail. But, I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. They're here. You can see I've done three so far; I've got a few more to go. The idea is embryonic. I think it's important. I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse and recycle \u2014 right at the end there \u2014 recycling is the last point I want to make; but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's \u2014 then I think we're going to be on our way. So these three are not perfect \u2014 they're ideas. I think that there are many problems to come, but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. And I hope you all take part.Thank you very much.

All of the lights are daylight bulbs.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nPaint is all low-volume chemical,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhich is very important when you're working in the room all the time.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nbut there's a work surface there.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd that's a plastic polymer.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBut I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nexperiment with polymers.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nWill they outlive me? They probably might.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nRight, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nIt actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nNow reusing is vital.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd we filter our own water.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nWe put them in bottles, refrigerate them,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nHere's a great little example.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIf you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwhich has been turned inside out and sewn up.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nIt's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThis is the kitchen, which is in the same room.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nI basically created a menu that allowed people\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nto choose the amount and volume of food\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nthat they wanted to consume.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nRather than me putting a dish down,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthey were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nOkay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nIt serves 220 people a day.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nWe generate quite a lot of waste.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis is the waste room.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nYou can't get rid of waste.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBut this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nIn here, I have produce and boxes\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat are unavoidable.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nturns food into an inner material,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwhich I can store and then compost later.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI compost it in this garden.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAll of the soil you can see there is basically my food,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwhich is generated by the restaurant,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand wine casks and all kinds of things.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThree compost bins --\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\ngo through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nreally good, makes fantastic compost.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nA couple of wormeries in there too.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd actually one of the wormeries\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nwas a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd I tried taking the dried food waste,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nputting it to the worms, going, \"There you go, dinner.\"\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt was like vegetable jerky,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand killed all of them.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI don't know how many worms [were] in there,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbut I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nWhat you're seeing here is a water filtration system.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThis takes the water out of the restaurant,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nruns it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand I sort of water the garden with it.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nmaybe wash hands with it, I don't know.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo, water is a very important aspect.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI started meditating on that\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand created a restaurant called Waterhouse.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIf I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthat is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nI managed to do it.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThis restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nsame chairs, same tables.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThey're all English and a little bit more sustainable.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nBut this is an electrical restaurant.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd it's run on hydroelectricity,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso I've gone from air to water.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNow it's important to understand\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthat this room\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis cooled by water, heated by water,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nfilters its own water,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand it's powered by water.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIt literally is Waterhouse.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe air handling system inside it --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nI got rid of air-conditioning\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nbecause I thought there was too much consumption going on there.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is basically air-handling.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\npumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nit's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\ncooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd this is an English willow air diffuser,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand that's softly moving\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat air current through the room.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nVery advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIn the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthere is hundreds of meters of coil piping.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThis takes the temperature of the canal\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nlives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nHe's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThere's no accident in names of these restaurants.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAcorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nfive restaurants based\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\non the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI've got metal and earth to come.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo you've got to watch your space for that.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nOkay. So this is my next project.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nFive weeks old,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nit's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe People's Supermarket.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSo basically, the restaurants only really hit\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\npeople who believed in what I was doing anyway.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nWhat I needed to do was get food out\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nto a broader spectrum of people.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nor perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is a social enterprise,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nnot-for-profit cooperative supermarket.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nIt really is about the social disconnect\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbetween food, communities\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nin urban settings\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand their relationship to rural growers --\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nconnecting communities in London to rural growers.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nReally important.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nI've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nIn fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe most sustainable supermarket in the world.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThat's zero food waste.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd no one's doing that just yet.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIn fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nlet's have a go. Try it on.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm going to get there before you.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nSo nature doesn't create waste\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\ndoesn't create waste as such.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nEverything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwith waste being the end of the beginning,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand it's an important statement to understand.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIf we don't stand up\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand make a difference\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand think about sustainable food,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthink about the sustainable nature of it,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthen we may fail.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nBut, I wanted to get up and show you\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat we can do it if we're more responsible.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nEnvironmentally conscious businesses are doable.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThey're here. You can see I've done three so far;\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nI've got a few more to go.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThe idea is embryonic.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nI think it's important.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand recycle -- right at the end there --\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nrecycling is the last point I want to make;\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbut it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthen I think we're going to be on our way.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI think that there are many problems to come,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbut with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd I hope you all take part.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThank you very much.

But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. First, of course, the economic meltdown. It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. (Laughter) Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama. By the way, the pronunciation is \"Eyjafjallajokull.\" None of your media got it right.(Laughter)But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin \u2014 who you see in the picture \u2014 in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit. Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm? Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. But I can surely tell you that in my country, much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere, men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector, and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems.(Applause)So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable, to found a financial services firm based on our values, and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. We weren't known as the typical \"women\" women in Iceland up until then. So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. And we got a great group of people to join us \u2014 principled people with great skills, and investors with a vision and values to match ours. And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that \u2014 and also there's a factor of luck and timing \u2014 we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values.So let me share with you our values. We believe in risk awareness. What does that mean? We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking, and we will not invest in things we don't understand. Not a complicated thing. But in 2007, at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures, it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market. We also believe in straight-talking, telling it as it is, using simple language that people understand, telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides, and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter, like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. And, although we do work in the financial sector, where Excel is king, we believe in emotional capital. And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. It is actually people that make money and lose money, not Excel spreadsheets.(Applause)Last, but not least, we believe in profit with principles. We care how we make our profit. So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. So we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest.But it wasn't just about the values, although we are convinced that they matter. It was also about a business opportunity. It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend, that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table. So what do you get? You get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results.But one has to wonder, now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland \u2014 and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now, and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change? Will government change?Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. I have days that I believe, but I have days that I'm full of doubt. Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? (Applause) Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity \u2014 to do the same things over and over again, hoping for a different outcome. So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. I want to see more revolutionary thinking, and I remain hopeful. Like TED, I believe in people. And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious, and they are going to start voting with their wallets, and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside, if they don't do it from the inside.But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland. We have a long history of strong, courageous, independent women, ever since the Viking age. And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society, I was seven \u2014 it happened to be my mother's birthday \u2014 October 24, 1975. Women in Iceland took the day off. From work or from home, they took the day off, and nothing worked in Iceland. (Laughter) They marched into the center of Reykjavik, and they put women's issues onto the agenda. And some say this was the start of a global movement. For me it was the start of a long journey, but I decided that day to matter. Five years later, Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president \u2014 first female to become head of state, single mom, a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. And at one of the campaign sessions, she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president \u2014 she was a woman, and even half a woman. That night she won the election, because she came back \u2014 not just because of his crappy behavior \u2014 but she came back and said, \"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it.\"(Applause)So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. But in spite of that, I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities. But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. We are not the same, and it's great. Because of our differences, we create and sustain life. So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life \u2014 either it's men or it's women. We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business. That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1030, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nIt sure used to be a lot

market.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWe also believe in straight-talking,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\ntelling it as it is,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nusing simple language that people understand,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\ntelling people about the downsides\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nas well as the potential upsides,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nlike our lack of belief in the sustainability\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nof the Icelandic financial sector\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthat already we had\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nmonths before the collapse hit us.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd, although we do work in the financial sector,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwhere Excel is king,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe believe in emotional capital.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd we believe\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat doing emotional due diligence\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nis just as important\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nas doing financial due diligence.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt is actually people\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat make money and lose money,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nnot Excel

principles.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe care how we make our profit.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwe are willing to do it with a long-term view,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand we like to have a wider definition of profits\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthan just the economic profit in the next quarter.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo we like to see profits,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nplus positive social\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand environmental benefits, when we invest.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nBut it wasn't just about the values,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nalthough we are convinced that they matter.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nIt was also about a business opportunity.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nIt's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat are going to create\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nsome of the most interesting investment opportunities\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nin the years to come.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe whole thing about the female trend\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nis not about women being better than men;\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nit is actually about\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nwomen being different from men,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nbringing different values and different ways to the table.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo what do you get? You get better decision-making,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nand you get less herd behavior,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand both of those things hit your bottom line\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwith very positive results.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nBut one has to wonder,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nnow that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand many would say that you in America\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nare heading for some more trouble as well.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow that we've had all that happen,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand we have all this data out there\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\ntelling us that it's much better to have diversity\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\naround the decision-making tables,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwill we see business and finance change?\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWill government change?\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWell I'll give you my straight talk about this.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nI have days that I believe,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nbut I have days that I'm full of doubt.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nHave you seen the incredible urge out there\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nto rebuild the very things that failed us?\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nEinstein said\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat this was the definition of insanity --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nto do the same things\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nover and over again,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nhoping for a different outcome.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nSo I guess the world is insane,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbecause I see entirely too much\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nof doing the same things over and over again,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nhoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nI want to see more revolutionary thinking,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand I remain hopeful.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nLike TED, I believe in people.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd I know that consumers\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nare becoming more conscious,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand they are going to start voting with their wallets,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand they are going to change the face\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nof business and finance from the outside,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nif they don't do it from the inside.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut I'm more of the revolutionary,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand I should be;

Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating \u2014 no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger \u2014 and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects. I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the \"man box.\" See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man. But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood.This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay. They're 11 and 12. Kendall's 15 months older than Jay. There was a period of time when my wife \u2014 her name is Tammie \u2014 and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay. (Laughter) And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying. It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.Now Kendall on the other hand \u2014 and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her \u2014 he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off. I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, \"Why are you crying? Hold your head up. Look at me. Explain to me what's wrong. Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. Why are you crying?\" And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, \"Just go in your room. Just go on, go on in your room. Sit down, get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a \u2014\" what? (Audience: Man.) Like a man. And he's five years old. And as I grow in life, I would say to myself, \"My God, what's wrong with me? What am I doing? Why would I do this?\" And I think back. I think back to my father.There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers. We lived in New York City, as I said. We lived in the Bronx at the time, and the burial was in a place called Long Island, it was about two hours outside of the city. And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. And the limousine empties out. My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying. He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground \u2014 something I just can't even imagine. The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying.I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box. I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, \"How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?\" Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that. No, the boy said to me \u2014 the boy said to me, \"It would destroy me.\" And I said to myself, \"God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?\"(Applause)It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old. I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. At this time we're living in the Bronx, and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old \u2014 younger guys. And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder, \"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?\" And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. He was a troubled kid. His mother had died from a heroin overdose. He was being raised by his grandmother. His father wasn't on the set. His grandmother had two jobs. He was home alone a lot. But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man. He was cool. He was fine. That's what the sisters said, \"He was fine.\" He was having sex. We all looked up to him.So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something \u2014 just playing around, doing something \u2014 I don't know what. He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, \"Hey Anthony.\" They called me Anthony growing up as a kid. \"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs.\" Johnny call, you go. So I run right upstairs. As he opens the door, he says to me, \"Do you want some?\" Now I immediately knew what he meant. Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, \"Do you want some?\" meant one of two things: sex or drugs \u2014 and we weren't doing drugs. Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy. Two things: One, I never had sex. We don't talk about that as men. You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life, the first time you had sex. For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. There ain't no first time. (Laughter) The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. Women are objects, especially sexual objects.Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that. So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, \"Yes.\" He told me to go in his room. I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. She's 16 years old. She's nude. She's what I know today to be mentally ill, higher-functioning at times than others. We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her. Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes.So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. So when I go in the room, I close the door. Folks, I'm petrified. I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything, and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. So now there's a living room full of guys. It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, \"It was good,\" and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door.Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught. But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me. It was way more important to me, about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her.See collectively, we as men are taught to have less value in women, to view them as property and the objects of men. We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it. You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad.So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay. The world I envision for her \u2014 how do I want men to be acting and behaving? I need you on board. I need you with me. I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men \u2014 that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.

It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. Let me begin with my parents. I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s \u2014 '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India. They belonged to boys. They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married. My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique. We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys. We were four girls and no boys. And my parents were part of a landed property family. My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us. He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school. Children don't choose a school. They just get the school which parents choose for them. So this is the foundation time which I got. I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters. And my father used to say at that time, \"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.\" I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened. I'm the only one who's left in India. One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. So we are four of us in four corners of the world.And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. One, they said, \"Life is on an incline. You either go up, or you come down.\" And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad. Out of 100, 90 are your creation. They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it. Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing. It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake. You can't do a thing about it. You've got to just respond to the situation. But that response comes out of those 90 points. Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, \"life on an incline,\" that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry, and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. I thought I must tell you this. Why I said this, is the background.This is what comes next. I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc. But I joined the Indian Police Service, and then it was a new pattern of policing. For me the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent and power to detect. This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India \u2014 the power to prevent. Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish. But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up. How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10? So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men. I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way I was different. And I redefined policing concepts in India. I'm going to take you on two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey. What you see, if you see the title called \"PM's car held.\" This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. (Laughter) That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it. It'll never happen again in India, because now it was once and forever. And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice. That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service. I had other options, but I didn't choose them.So I'm going to move on. This is about tough policing, equal policing. Now I was known as \"here's a woman that's not going to listen.\" So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings, postings which others would say no. I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. Normally police officers don't want to do prison. They sent me to prison to lock me up, thinking, \"Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. Let's lock her up.\" Here I got a prison assignment. This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. Obviously, it was. But 10,000 men, of which only 400 were women \u2014 10,000 \u2014 9,000 plus about 600 were men. Terrorists, rapists, burglars, gangsters \u2014 some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. And then how did I deal with them? The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them. And I said, \"Do you pray?\" When I looked at the group, I said, \"Do you pray?\" They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit. I said, \"Do you pray?\" And they didn't say anything. I said, \"Do you pray? Do you want to pray?\" They said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"All right, let's pray.\" I prayed for them, and things started to change. This is a visual of education inside the prison.Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies. I started this with community support. Government had no budget. It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. This was initiated in Delhi prison. You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. These are hundreds of classes. Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program \u2014 the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. We converted this into an ashram \u2014 from a prison to an ashram through education. I think that's the bigger change. It was the beginning of a change. Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. Books came from donated schoolbooks. Stationery was donated. Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison. Now if I'd not done that, it would have been a hellhole.That's the second landmark. I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. One, the numbers you'll never get to see. Secondly, this concept. This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners. One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. And this is what transformed. You want to know more about this, go and see this film, \"Doing Time, Doing Vipassana.\" You will hear about it, and you will love it. And write to me on KiranBedi.com, and I'll respond to you. Let me show you the next slide. I took the same concept of mindfulness, because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison? Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind. I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was \"we\" and \"they,\" and that the people don't cooperate. This worked.This is a feedback box called a petition box. This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances. This was a magic box. This was a sensitive box. This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. If you see somebody in the blue \u2014 yeah, this guy \u2014 he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.Let me wrap it up. I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands \u2014 India is all about thousands. Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India. That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. Friends, you will hear a lot about it. That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life.Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much.

In my mother's day, she didn't go to college. Not a lot of women did. And now, for every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce. And they're starting to dominate lots of professions \u2014 doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants. Over 50 percent of managers are women these days, and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women. So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture \u2014 what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes.For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated \u2014 tough, rugged, in control of his own environment. A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen, who is a parody of American manhood, and that's what we have in our commercials today. The phrase \"first-born son\" is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. In American fertility clinics, 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. And in places where you wouldn't think, such as South Korea, India and China, the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little, and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons.If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere. You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '20s and the '60s also come to mind. But the difference is that, back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time, it's not about passion, and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not, and that's why I talk about the \"end of men.\"Now all you men out there, this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes, because the point is that this is happening to all of us. I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it, then I think it will go much more smoothly. I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern \u2014 that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called \"Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,\" in which she described how hard the recession had hit men, and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. And I realized that two things were different this time around. The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men \u2014 that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women.And now look at this second set of slides. These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. Women, a majority of the workplace. And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs. This second set of headlines \u2014 you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. And look at that last headline \u2014 young women earning more than young men. That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been. But in fact, they found something very surprising. It was young, single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding, to do a nationwide survey. So they spread out all the census data, and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker, which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities, women, young women, were making more money than young men. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them.Now, I've just laid out the picture for you, but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph, and what you'll see on this graph \u2014 it begins in 1973, just before women start flooding the workforce, and it brings us up to our current day. And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. Now what does that mean? It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs \u2014 and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy. This has been going on for 40 years now. But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue. You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class, but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. There we go. So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. The men sort of stagnate there, while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs. So what's that about? It looks like women got some power boost on a video game, or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high. But of course, it's not about that.What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. Those two economies require very different skills, and as it happens, women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree, but you had a specific set of skills, and with the help of a union, you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life. But that really isn't true anymore. This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength, which is what's helped men along all these years. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing.If you look at management theory these days, it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton, right? You would be issuing orders from above. You would be very hierarchical. You would tell everyone below you what to do. But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his \u2014 get the employees \u2014 see, I still say \"his\" \u2014 who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well.And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top, and then at the working class, all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. So that's childcare, elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do. Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work, middle-aged, former steelworker guy to watch their children at home, and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce. And here the story is fairly simple. Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. Why? This is a real mystery. People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. They're used to thinking of themselves as providers, and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the \"boy crisis.\" Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys, for whatever reason, are doing worse in school than very young girls, and people have theories about that. Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum, and little girls are better at that than little boys? Or that we require kids to sit still too much, and so boys initially feel like failures? And some people say it's because, in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school. Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it, so I don't have the answer. But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert, who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa, to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse.(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter. I mean they have much larger vocabulary. They learn much faster. They are more controlled. On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.Hanna Rosin: And why is that?Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely.HR: So there you go. This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City \u2014 working-class college. Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life \u2014 that my husband and I would both work, and that we would equally raise the children. But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. Basically, the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day, that their husband would maybe have a job, but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. And this was kind of a shocker to me. And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls: \"Men are the new ball and chain.\"(Laughter)Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right? And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. The night after I talked to these college girls, I also went to a men's group in Kansas, and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. They were men who had been contractors, or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom, and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority, that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore, and they were not really the providers. So who were they? And this was very disheartening for them. And what he did was he wrote down on the board \"$85,000,\" and he said, \"That's her salary,\" and then he wrote down \"$12,000.\" \"That's your salary. So who's the man now?\" he asked them. \"Who's the damn man? She's the man now.\" And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this, because I think it can be pretty painful, and we really have to work through it.And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. It's happening all over the world. In India, poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men. And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea. Over several decades, South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code. And if women failed to birth male children, they were basically treated like domestic servants. And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. But over the '70s and '80s, the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize, and so what they did was, they started to push women into the workforce. Now they've been asking a question since 1985: \"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?\" And now look at the chart. That's from 1985 to 2003. How much do you prefer a first-born son?So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. Now because we haven't fully processed this information, it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways, where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the \"omega males\" popping up, who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. And they come up in lots of different forms. So we have the perpetual adolescent. We have the charmless misanthrope. Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive, the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women. You've got Lady Gaga. You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie. And it's not just for the young, right? Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal.So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term \"glass ceiling.\" Now I've never really liked this term. For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women. And we have a lot of skill and experience, but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling? And also, \"shattering the glass ceiling\" is a terrible phrase. What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling?So the image that I like to think of, instead of glass ceiling, is the high bridge. It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge, but it's also pretty exhilarating, because it's beautiful up there, and you're looking out on a beautiful view. And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. You can bring your husband along. You can bring your friends, or your colleagues, or your babysitter to walk along with you. And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready. But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it.Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id": 1033, "subtitle":

--\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\ndoctors, lawyers,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nbankers, accountants.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nOver 50 percent of managers are women these days,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand in the 15 professions\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nprojected to grow the most in the next decade,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nall but two of them are dominated by women.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nSo the global economy is becoming a place\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwhere women are more successful than men,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nbelieve it or not,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand these economic changes\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nare starting to rapidly affect our culture --\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwhat our romantic comedies look like,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nwhat our marriages look like,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nwhat our dating lives look like,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand our new set of superheroes.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nFor a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\ntough, rugged,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nin control of his own environment.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nA few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand replaced by this\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nmuch less impressive specimen,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwho is a parody of American manhood,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nand that's what we have in our commercials today.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThe phrase \"first-born son\"\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nis so deeply ingrained in our consciousness\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat this statistic alone shocked me.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIn American fertility clinics,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\n75 percent of couples\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nare requesting girls and not boys.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd in places where you wouldn't think,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nsuch as South Korea, India and China,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe very strict patriarchal societies\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nare starting to break down a little,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand families are no longer\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nstrongly preferring first-born sons.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIf you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand start to connect the dots,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nyou can see the evidence everywhere.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nYou can see it in college graduation patterns,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nin job projections,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nin our marriage statistics,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nyou can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat something amazing and unprecedented\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nis happening with women.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nCertainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThe '20s and the '60s also come to mind.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nBut the difference is that, back then,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nit was driven by a very passionate feminist movement\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nthat was trying to project its own desires,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhereas this time, it's not about passion,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand it's not about any kind of movement.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is really just about the facts\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nof this economic moment that we live in.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThe 200,000-year period\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nin which men have been top dog\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nis truly coming to an end, believe it or not,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand that's why I talk about the \"end of men.\"\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nNow all you men out there,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthis is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nbecause the point is that this\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nis happening to all of us.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nI myself have a husband and a father\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand two sons whom I dearly love.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd this is why I like to talk about this,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbecause if we don't acknowledge it,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nthen the transition will be pretty painful.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBut if we do take account of it,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthen I think it will go much more smoothly.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nI first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nI was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand I started to notice a distinct pattern --\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthat the recession was affecting men\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nmuch more deeply than it was affecting women.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd I remembered back to about 10 years ago\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhen I read a book by Susan Faludi\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\ncalled \"Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,\"\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nin which she described how hard the recession had hit men,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand I started to think about\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwhether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd I realized that two things were different this time around.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThe first was that\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthese were no longer just temporary hits\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthat the recession was giving men --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat this was reflecting a deeper\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nunderlying shift in our global economy.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd second, that the story was no longer\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\njust about the crisis of men,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nbut it was also about what was happening to women.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd now look at this second set of slides.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThese are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nThese are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWomen, a majority of the workplace.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThis second set of headlines --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nyou can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd look at that last headline --\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nyoung women earning more than young men.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThat particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThey were basically asked by one of their clients\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwho was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd they expected that it would be young families,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nor young men, just like it had always been.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBut in fact, they found something very surprising.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nIt was young, single women\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nwho were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nto do a nationwide survey.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo they spread out all the census data,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhich is that in 1,997\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nout of 2,000 communities,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwomen, young women,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwere making more money than young men.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nSo here you have a generation of young women\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwho grow up thinking of themselves\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nas being more powerful earners\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthan the young men around them.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nNow, I've just laid out the picture for you,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nbut I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand what you'll see on this graph --\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nit begins in 1973,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\njust before women start flooding the workforce,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand it brings us up to our current day.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd basically what you'll see\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nis what economists talk about\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nas the polarization of the economy.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow what does that mean?\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand low-skill, low-wage jobs --\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThis has been going on for 40 years now.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut this process is affecting men\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nvery differently than it's affecting women.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nYou'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nYou'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nbut see what happens to women and see what happens to men.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThere we go.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWatch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe men sort of stagnate there,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhile the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo what's that about?\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nIt looks like women got some power boost on a video game,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nor like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthat lets them shoot up high.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nBut of course, it's not about that.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nWhat it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWe used to have a manufacturing economy,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwhich was about building goods and products,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand now we have a service economy\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand an information and creative economy.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThose two economies require very different skills,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand as it happens, women have been much better\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nat acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIt used to be that you were\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\na guy who went to high school\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwho didn't have a college degree,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut you had a specific set of skills,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand with the help of a union,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nyou could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nBut that really isn't true anymore.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThis new economy is pretty indifferent\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nto size and strength,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhich is what's helped men along all these years.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWhat the economy requires now\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nis a whole different set of skills.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nYou basically need intelligence,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nyou need an ability to sit still and focus,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nto communicate openly,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nto be able to listen to people\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand those are things that women do extremely well,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nas we're seeing.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIf you look at management theory these days,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nit used to be that our ideal leader\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nsounded something like General Patton, right?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nYou would be issuing orders from above.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nYou would be very hierarchical.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nYou would tell everyone below you what to do.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut that's not what an ideal leader is like now.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIf you read management books now,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\na leader is somebody who can foster creativity,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwho can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say \"his\" --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwho can get the employees to talk to each other,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwho can basically build teams and get them to be creative.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd those are all things that women do very well.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nAnd then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nWomen enter the workplace at the top,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand then at the working class,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nall the new jobs that are created\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nare the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nSo that's childcare,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nelder care and food preparation.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo those are all the jobs that are growing,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand those are jobs that women tend to do.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nNow one day it might be\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthat mothers will hire an out-of-work,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nmiddle-aged, former steelworker guy\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nto watch their children at home,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nTo see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nyou have to look at our future workforce.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd here the story is fairly simple.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWomen are getting college degrees\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nat a faster rate than men.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWhy? This is a real mystery.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nPeople have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nto community college, say, and retool themselves,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nlearn a new set of skills?\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWell it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nThey're used to thinking of themselves as providers,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand they can't seem to build the social networks\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthat allow them to get through college.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo for some reason\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nmen just don't end up going back to college.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd what's even more disturbing\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis what's happening with younger boys.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThere's been about a decade of research\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nabout what people are calling the \"boy crisis.\"\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nNow the boy crisis is this idea\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat very young boys, for whatever reason,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare doing worse in school than very young girls,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand people have theories about that.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIs it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand little girls are better at that than little boys?\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nOr that we require kids to sit still too much,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand so boys initially feel like failures?\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd some people say it's because,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nin 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBecause I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nso I don't have the answer.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBut in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwho's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nto talk to you about\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhy the boys in her class do worse.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nI mean they have much larger vocabulary.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThey learn much faster.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThey are more controlled.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nOn the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nHanna Rosin: And why is that?\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nNoa: Why? They were just not listening to the class\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwhile the girls sat there very nicely.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nHR: So there you go.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThis whole thesis really came home to me\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nwhen I went to visit a college in Kansas City --\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nworking-class college.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nCertainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat my husband and I would both work,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand that we would equally raise the children.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nBut these college girls\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nhad a completely different view of their future.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBasically, the way they said it to me is\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat they would be working 18 hours a day,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat their husband would maybe have a job,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nbut that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd this was kind of a shocker to me.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n\"Men are the new ball and chain.\"\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nNow you laugh,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nbut that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd I think the reason it has a sting\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis because thousands of years of history\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\ndon't reverse themselves\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwithout a lot of pain,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand that's why I talk about\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nus all going through this together.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThe night after I talked to these college girls,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nI also went to a men's group in Kansas,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhich I spoke to you about earlier.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThey were men who had been contractors,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nor they had been building houses\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nand they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd the instructor was up there in the class\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nexplaining to them all the ways\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nin which they had lost their identity in this new age.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHe was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nthat nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand they were not really the providers.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nSo who were they?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd this was very disheartening for them.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd what he did was he wrote down on the board\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\n\"$85,000,\"\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand he said, \"That's her salary,\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand then he wrote down \"$12,000.\"\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\n\"That's your salary.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nSo who's the man now?\" he asked them.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\n\"Who's the damn man?\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nShe's the man now.\"\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd that really sent a shudder through the room.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nbecause I think it can be pretty painful,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we really have to work through it.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd the other reason it's kind of urgent\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nis because it's not just happening in the U.S.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nIt's happening all over the world.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIn India, poor women are learning English\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfaster than their male counterparts\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nin order to staff the new call centers\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthat are growing in India.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nIn China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nis happening because women are starting businesses,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nsmall businesses, faster than men.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nOver several decades,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nSouth Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThey basically enshrined the second-class status of women\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nin the civil code.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd if women failed to birth male children,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthey were basically treated like domestic servants.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nso they could have a male child.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nBut over the '70s and '80s,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nthe South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand so what they did was,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthey started to push women into the workforce.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nNow they've been asking a question since 1985:\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\n\"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd now look at the chart.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThat's from 1985 to 2003.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nHow much do you prefer a first-born son?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nSo you can see that these economic changes\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nreally do have a strong effect on our culture.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nNow because we haven't fully processed this information,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nit's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nin these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwhere you can see that the stereotypes are changing.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAnd so we have on the male side\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhat one of my colleagues likes to call the \"omega males\" popping up,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwho are the males who are romantically challenged losers\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwho can't find a job.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd they come up in lots of different forms.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nSo we have the perpetual adolescent.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nWe have the charmless misanthrope.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nThen we have our Bud Light guy\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwho's the happy couch potato.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe sexiest man alive\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\ngets romantically played these days in a movie.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd then on the female side, you have the opposite,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nin which you have these crazy superhero women.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nYou've got Lady Gaga.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nYou've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd it's not just for the young, right?\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nEven Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd so it feels like we have to move from this place\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwhere we've got these uber-exaggerated images\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\ninto something that feels a little more normal.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nSo for a long time in the economic sphere,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwe've lived with the term \"glass ceiling.\"\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nNow I've never really liked this term.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nFor one thing, it puts men and women\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nin a really antagonistic relationship with one another,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nbecause the men are these devious tricksters up there\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nwho've put up this glass ceiling.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd we have a lot of skill and experience,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nbut it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nto get through that glass ceiling?\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd also, \"shattering the glass ceiling\" is a terrible phrase.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWhat crazy person\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwould pop their head through a glass ceiling?\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo the image that I like to think of,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\ninstead of glass ceiling,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nis the high bridge.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nbut it's also pretty exhilarating,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nbecause it's beautiful up there,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand you're looking out on a beautiful view.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nThere's no man or woman standing in the middle\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nabout to cut the cables.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nThere's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.\n\n00:15:23.958 -->

From mistakes", "duration": "605", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/diana_laufenberg_3_ways_to_teach", "transcript": "I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. In 1931, my grandmother \u2014 bottom left for you guys over here \u2014 graduated from the eighth grade. She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned. Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse. And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome. This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. But the information was closer to me. I could get access to it.In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet. Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government. My first year \u2014 super gung-ho \u2014 going to teach American government, loved the political system. Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. Year two: learned a few things \u2014 had to change my tactic. And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community.They produced flyers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. The older teachers \u2014 more experienced \u2014 looked at me and went, \"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.\" (Laughter) \"She doesn't know what she's in for.\" But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night, all 90 kids \u2014 dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it. I had to just sit and watch. It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. It meant something to them. And they will step up.From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students. Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again, \"thrilled\" to learn. But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school, and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie \"Hotel Rwanda\" is based after. And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it. And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing. I asked them to produce a little movie about it. It's the first time we'd done this. Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share. The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people? The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary.Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus. So what do you do when the information is all around you? Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning. That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong. To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project. I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure.My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history. And they had certain criteria to do it. They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it. They can talk \u2014 they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. But I gave them the room to just do the thing. Go create. Go figure it out. Let's see what we can do. And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. This was done in like two or three days. And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.And when I sat the students down, I said, \"Who's got the best one?\" And they immediately went, \"There it is.\" Didn't read anything. \"There it is.\" And I said, \"Well what makes it great?\" And they're like, \"Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color. And there's some ... \" And they went through all that we processed out loud. And I said, \"Go read it.\" And they're like, \"Oh, that one wasn't so awesome.\" And then we went to another one \u2014 it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information \u2014 and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves, and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from. And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process.There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully \u2014 this is one of my favorites \u2014 of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it. Ask them really interesting questions. They will not disappoint. Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls. This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces.The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark. And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better.(Applause)", "id": 1034, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI have been teaching for a long time,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand in doing so\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nhave acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nthat I really wish more people would understand\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nabout the potential of students.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIn 1931, my grandmother --\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nbottom left for you guys over here --\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\ngraduated from the eighth grade.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nShe went to school to get the information\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nbecause that's where the information lived.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nIt was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nand she needed to go there to get the information,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nbecause that's how you learned.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nFast-forward a generation:\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nthis is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nwhere my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAnd he again had to travel to the school\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nto get the information from the teacher,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nstored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nand take it with him,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbecause that is how information was being transported\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nfrom teacher to student and then used in the world.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nWhen I was a kid,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nwe had a set of encyclopedias at my house.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIt was purchased the year I was born,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand it was extraordinary,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbecause I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe information was inside my house\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand it was awesome.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nThis was different\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nthan either generation had experienced before,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand it changed the way I interacted with information\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\neven at just a small level.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nBut the information was closer to me.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nI could get access to it.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nIn the time that passes\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbetween when I was a kid in high school\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand when I started teaching,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nwe really see the advent of the Internet.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nRight about the time that the Internet gets going\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nas an educational tool,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI take off from Wisconsin\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand move to Kansas, small town Kansas,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nwhere I had an opportunity to teach\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nin a lovely, small-town,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nrural Kansas school district,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwhere I was teaching my favorite subject,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAmerican government.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nMy first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nloved the political system.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nKids in the 12th grade:\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nnot exactly all that enthusiastic\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nabout the American government system.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nYear two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd I put in front of them an authentic experience\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthat allowed them to learn for themselves.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nI didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nI posed a problem in front of them,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwhich was to put on an election forum for their own community.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThey produced flyers.

Perfect field trip.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThe problem then becomes\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nhow do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand deal with the subject in a way\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthat is responsible and respectful,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand they know what to do with it.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas an example of a gentleman\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwho singularly used his life to do something positive.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI then challenged the kids to identify\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nsomeone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat they could identify that had done a similar thing.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI asked them to produce a little movie about it.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt's the first time we'd done this.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nbut they were into it.

00:05:04.958\nFast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nI teach at the Science Leadership Academy,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhich is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand the school district of Philadelphia.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nWe are a nine through 12 public school,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nbut we do school quite differently.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI moved there primarily\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nto be part of a learning environment\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat validated the way that I knew that kids learned,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand that really wanted to investigate\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nwhat was possible\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwhen you are willing to let go\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nof some of the paradigms of the past,\n\n00:05:31.958 -->

00:05:39.958\nand to a moment when we have information surplus.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo what do you do when the information is all around you?\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWhy do you have kids come to school\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nif they no longer have to come there to get the information?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIn Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nso the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\ntaking them home, getting access to information.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhen you've given the tool\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto acquire information to students,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nis that you have to be comfortable with this idea\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nof allowing kids to fail\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nas part of

culture of one right answer\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthat can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand I am here to share with you:\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nit is not learning.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThat is the absolute wrong thing to ask,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nto tell kids to never be wrong.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nTo ask them to always have the right answer\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\ndoesn't allow them to learn.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo we did this project,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand this is one of the artifacts of the project.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI almost never show them off\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nbecause of the issue of the idea of failure.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nMy students produced these info-graphics\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nas a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nresponding to the oil spill.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI asked them to take the examples that we were seeing\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nof the info-graphics that existed\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nin a lot of mass media,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand take a look at what were the interesting components of it,\n\n00:06:58.958

criteria to do it.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThey were a little uncomfortable with it,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nbecause we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey can talk -- they're very smooth,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand they can write very, very well,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbut asking them to communicate ideas in a different way\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwas a little uncomfortable for them.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nBut I gave them the room to just do the thing.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nGo create. Go figure it out.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nLet's see what we can do.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd the student that persistently\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nturns out the best visual product did not disappoint.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThis was done in like two or three days.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd this is the work of the student that consistently did it.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd when I sat the students down, I said, \"Who's got the best one?\"\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd they immediately went, \"There it is.\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nDidn't read anything. \"There it is.\"\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd I said, \"Well what makes it great?\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd there's some ... \" And they went through all that we processed out loud.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd I said, \"Go read it.\"\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, that one wasn't so awesome.\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd then we went to another one --\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nit didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand spent an hour talking about the learning process,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbecause it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nor whether or not it was what I could create.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nIt asked them to create for themselves,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand it allowed them to fail,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nprocess, learn from.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd when we do another round of this in my class this year,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthey will do better this time,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nbecause learning\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas to include an amount of failure,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nbecause failure is instructional\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nin the process.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThere are a million pictures\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthat I could click through here,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nof students learning,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nof what learning can look like\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nin a landscape where we let go of the idea\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthat kids have to come to school to get the information,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nbut instead, ask them what they can do with it.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAsk them really interesting questions.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey will not disappoint.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAsk them to go to places,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nto see things for themselves,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nto actually experience the learning,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nto play, to inquire.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThis is one of my favorite photos,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbecause this was taken on Tuesday,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nwhen I asked the students to go to the polls.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThis is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nBut this is learning too,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nbecause we asked them to go out into real spaces.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThe main point\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nis that, if we continue to look at education\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nas if it's about coming to school\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nto get the information\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nand not about experiential learning,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nempowering student voice and embracing failure,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwe're missing the mark.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd everything that everybody is talking about today\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nisn't possible if we keep having an educational system\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat does not value these qualities,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nbecause we won't get there with a standardized test,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWe know how to do this better,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand it's time to do better.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Let's talk parenting taboos", "duration": "1028", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rufus_griscom_alisa_volkman_let_s_talk_parenting_taboos", "transcript": "Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins \u2014 the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son, Declan. Obviously a really profound moment, and it changed our lives in many ways. It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways, and those unexpected ways we later reflected on, that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us, and a year later, we launched Babble, a website for parents.Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.AV: We did.RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. It was a website called Nerve.com, the tagline of which was \"literate smut.\" It was in theory, and hopefully in practice, a smart online magazine about sex and culture.AV: That spawned a dating site. But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble, which we did. And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing, which is, of course, relevant, but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. It seems to us that when people start dissembling, people start lying about things, that's when it gets really interesting. That's a subject that we want to dive into. And we've been surprised to find, as young parents, that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex.AV: It's true. So like we said, the early years were really wonderful, but they were also really difficult. And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. (Laughter) We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework, but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this. And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying. I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all.RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at, with these beautiful images, and looked at the scene in our actual living room, it looked a little bit more like this. These are our three sons. And of course, they're not always crying and screaming, but with three boys, there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should.AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing, and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way.RG: So today, what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. And of course, there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting, but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. So the first, taboo number one: you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital. We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.AV: We, or I?RG: I'm sorry. Misuse of the pronoun. Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child \u2014 (AV: Thank you.) \u2014 and I was there with a catcher's mitt. And I was there with my arms open. The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful, beautiful child, and I remember, as she was approaching me, the voices of friends saying, \"The moment they put the baby in your hands, you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.\" So I was bracing myself for the moment. The baby was coming, and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands, it was an extraordinary moment. This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. And you can see, our eyes were glistening. I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife, with deep, deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. And it was also, of course, surreal. I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure. I was incredulous, \"Are you sure this is our child?\" And this was all quite remarkable. But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection, but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.And so we've done something here that is heretical. We have charted our love for our child over time. (Laughter) This, as you know, is an act of heresy. You're not allowed to chart love. The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. You're either in love, or you're not in love. You love, or you don't love. And I think the reality is that love is a process, and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you. And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months, maybe their first year, that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up, because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. But we like to joke, in the first few months of all of our children's lives, this is Uncle Rufus. (Laughter)RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies. So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.RG: Uh oh.AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here, and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.RG: The far left. AV: No!(Laughter)RG: Cruel.AV: Nothing more to be said.(Laughter)I'll move on to taboo number two. You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date. I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. It was a really wonderful experience, but when I got home, I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out, and I was really surprised by those feelings. I did expect it to be difficult, have sleepless nights, constant feedings, but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced, and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me, that I was going to be feeling this way. And I called my sister whom I'm very close to \u2014 and had three children \u2014 and I asked her, \"Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way, that I was going to have these \u2014 feeling incredibly isolated?\" And she said \u2014 I'll never forget \u2014 \"It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time.\"RG: And of course, we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. And that this, of course, one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. So Alisa's experience is not isolated. So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. Of those, 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five \u2014 probably really zero to two. In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.AV: So taboo number three: you can't talk about your miscarriage \u2014 but today I'll talk about mine. So after we had Declan, we kind of recalibrated our expectations. We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant, and I soon learned that we were having a boy, and then when I was five months, we learned that we had lost our child. This is actually the last little image we have of him. And it was obviously a very difficult time \u2014 really painful. As I was working through that mourning process, I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. I really wanted to crawl into a hole, and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way, is on a really deep gut level, I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed, frankly, that, in some respects, I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. And of course, it made me question, if I wasn't able to have another child, what would that mean for my marriage, and just me as a woman. So it was a very difficult time. As I started working through it more, I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. People I interacted with daily, worked with, was friends with, family members that I had known a long time, had never shared with me their own stories. And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork, and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of, which was reassuring and also really concerning. And I think, miscarriage is an invisible loss. There's not really a lot of community support around it. There's really no ceremony, rituals, or rites. And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life, and there's a lot of community support, and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.RG: Which is too bad because, of course, it's a very common and very traumatic experience. Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, and I find this astounding. In a survey, 74 percent of women said that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful. And astoundingly, 22 percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.So taboo number four: you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day, our first son, Declan, was nine months old, and I was sitting there on the couch, and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, \"Stumbling on Happiness.\" And I got about two-thirds of the way through, and there was a chart on the right-hand side \u2014 on the right-hand page \u2014 that we've labeled here \"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent.\" This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. Basically, there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction, which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness, that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life, this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. We were despondent.AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study. So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining.RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents, because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. We said, something is wrong here. There's something missing from these studies. It can't possibly be that bad. So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece, and she interviewed four scientists, and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert, and we did indeed find a silver lining. So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. And so we all remember as children, the tiniest little thing \u2014 and we see it on the faces of our children \u2014 the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation, and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. And then, of course, as you get older, it's almost like age is a form of lithium.As you get older, you become more stable. And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s, is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. You start to realize that \"Hey, I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps, but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. So I'm not going to go. I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go.\" So your average happiness goes up, but you lose those transcendent moments.AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child, and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows \u2014 the highs being the first steps, the first smile, your child reading to you for the first time \u2014 the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night. But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way, which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying.RG: And so in effect, we trade average happiness. We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this? There's another factor in our case. We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives, and this is a bonus taboo.AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together, especially with three children \u2014 and we are.RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end. Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble, the venture capitalists said, \"We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives, because there's an extra point of failure. It's a bad idea. Don't do it.\" And we obviously went forward. We did. We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did, because in this phase of one's life, the incredibly scarce resource is time. And if you're really passionate about what you do every day \u2014 which we are \u2014 and you're also passionate about your relationship, this is the only way we know how to do it. And so the final question that we would ask is: can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards? It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy, but they're sometimes pretty quick. And so how about that average baseline of happiness? Can we move that up a little bit?AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about, is really the result of walking into parenting \u2014 and really any long-term partnership for that matter \u2014 with the wrong expectations. And if you have the right expectations and expectation management, we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.RG: And so this is what \u2014 And we think that a lot of parents, when you get in there \u2014 in our case anyway \u2014 you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go. Get out of the airplane, it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience, particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty, but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences, that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.RG + AV: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1036, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nAlisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nthe dramatic moments of the birth\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nof our first son, Declan.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nObviously a really profound moment,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nand it changed our lives in many ways.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIt also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand those unexpected ways we later reflected on,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nthat eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand a year later, we launched Babble,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\na website for parents.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nRufus Griscom: Now I think of our story\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nas starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nRG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAV: We did.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nRG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nIt was a website called Nerve.com,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthe tagline of which was \"literate smut.\"\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nIt was in theory, and hopefully in practice,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\na smart online magazine\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nabout sex and culture.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAV: That spawned a dating site.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nBut you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nYou follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nwhich we did.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nRG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwas not just the life stage thing,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwhich is, of course, relevant,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nbut it was really more about\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nour desire to speak very honestly\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nabout subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nIt seems to us that\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nwhen people start dissembling, people start lying about things,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat's when it gets really interesting.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThat's a subject that we want to dive into.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd we've been surprised to find, as young parents,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nthat there are almost more taboos around parenting\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthan there are around sex.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAV: It's true. So like we said,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe early years were really wonderful,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nbut they were also really difficult.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd we feel like some of that difficulty\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwas because of this false advertisement around parenting.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nWe subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbut really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd we went into parenting\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nexpecting our lives to look like this.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThe sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nI would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand in fact, it was not like that at all.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nRG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthat we were looking at, with these beautiful images,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand looked at the scene in our actual living room,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nit looked a little bit more like this.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThese are our three sons.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd of course, they're not always crying and screaming,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nbut with three boys, there's a decent probability\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthat at least one of them will not be comporting himself\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nexactly as he should.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWe really felt like what we went in expecting\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nhad nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nWe really wanted to let them understand\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhat the realities of parenting were in an honest way.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nRG: So today, what we would love to do\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nis share with you four parenting taboos.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd of course, there are many more than four things\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nyou can't say about parenting,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbut we would like to share with you today\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nfour that are particularly relevant for us personally.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo the first, taboo number one:\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nyou can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nin the very first minute.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nI remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWe were in the process of giving birth to our first child.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAV: We, or I?\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nRG: I'm sorry.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nMisuse of the pronoun.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAlisa was very generously in the process\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nof giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\n-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd I was there with my arms open.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThe nurse was coming at me\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nwith this beautiful, beautiful child,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand I remember, as she was approaching me,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthe voices of friends saying,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\n\"The moment they put the baby in your hands,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nyou will feel a sense of love that will come over you\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthat is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthan anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo I was bracing myself for the moment.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe baby was coming,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand I was ready for this Mack truck of love\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nto just knock me off my feet.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nit was an extraordinary moment.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nThis picture is from literally a few seconds after\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthe baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd you can see, our eyes were glistening.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith deep, deep gratitude\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat we had what appeared to be a healthy child.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd it was also, of course, surreal.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nI was incredulous, \"Are you sure this is our child?\"\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this was all quite remarkable.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nBut what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbut nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd so we've done something here\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthat is heretical.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWe have charted\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nour love for our child over time.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThis, as you know, is an act of heresy.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nYou're not allowed to chart love.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nThe reason you're not allowed to chart love\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis because we think of love as a binary thing.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nYou're either in love, or you're not in love.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nYou love, or you don't love.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd I think the reality is that love is a process,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand I think the problem with thinking of love\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nas something that's binary\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nis that it causes us\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nto be unduly concerned\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthat love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nBut I think a lot of men do go through this sense\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nin the early months, maybe their first year,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthat their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nbecause you can notice where he dips in the first years\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwhere I think I was doing most of the work.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nBut we like to joke,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin the first few months of all of our children's lives,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthis is Uncle Rufus.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nRG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthat I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\namongst other babies.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nRG: Uh oh.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nRG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nRG: The far left. AV: No!\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nRG: Cruel.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAV: Nothing more to be said.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nI'll move on to taboo number two.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nYou can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI felt incredibly connected to the community around me.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\ntracking it down till the actual due-date.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nI felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThat continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIt was a really wonderful experience,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut when I got home,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI suddenly felt very disconnected\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nand suddenly shut in and shut out,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand I was really surprised by those feelings.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI did expect it to be difficult,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nhave sleepless nights, constant feedings,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut I did not expect the feelings\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof isolation and loneliness that I experienced,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthat I was going to be feeling this way.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd I called my sister\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhom I'm very close to -- and had three children --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand I asked her, \"Why didn't you tell me\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI was going to be feeling this way,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?\"\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd she said -- I'll never forget --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n\"It's just not something you want to say to a mother\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat's having a baby for the first time.\"\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nRG: And of course, we think\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nit's precisely what you really should be saying\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nto mothers who have kids for the first time.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd that this, of course, one of the themes for us\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis that we think\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat candor and brutal honesty\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nis critical to us collectively\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nbeing great parents.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd it's hard not to think\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat part of what leads to this sense of isolation\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nis our modern world.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nSo Alisa's experience is not isolated.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo your 58 percent of mothers surveyed\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nreport feelings of loneliness.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nOf those, 67 percent are most lonely\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhen their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nIn the process of preparing this,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwe looked at how some other cultures around the world\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ndeal with this period of time,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nbecause here in the Western world,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nless than 50 percent of us live near our family members,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwhich I think is part of why this is such a tough period.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo to take one example among many:\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nin Southern India\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthere's a practice known as jholabhari,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nin which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nmoves in with her mother\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ngive birth and returns home to her nuclear family\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nseveral months after the child is born.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd this is one of many ways\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAV: So taboo number three:\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nyou can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo after we had Declan,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nwe kind of recalibrated our expectations.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWe thought we actually could go through this again\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nand thought we knew what we would be up against.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand I soon learned that we were having a boy,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand then when I was five months,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwe learned that we had lost our child.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nThis is actually the last little image we have of him.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd it was obviously a very difficult time --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nreally painful.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAs I was working through that mourning process,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nI was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI really wanted to crawl into a hole,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand I didn't really know how I was going\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nto work my way back into my surrounding community.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nis on a really deep gut level,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nI was feeling a lot of shame\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand embarrassed, frankly,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthat, in some respects, I had failed\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nat delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd of course, it made me question,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nif I wasn't able to have another child,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwhat would that mean for my marriage,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand just me as a woman.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo it was a very difficult time.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nAs I started working through it more,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nI started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nI was really amazed\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nby all the stories that started flooding in.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nPeople I interacted with daily,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nworked with, was friends with,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nfamily members that I had known a long time,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nhad never shared with me their own stories.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand I felt like I happened upon\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthis secret society of women that I now was a part of,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nwhich was reassuring and also really concerning.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd I think,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nmiscarriage is an invisible loss.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThere's not really a lot of community support around it.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThere's really no ceremony,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nrituals, or rites.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand there's a lot of community support,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand it's something women don't have with miscarriage.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nRG: Which is too bad because, of course,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nit's a very common and very traumatic experience.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nFifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand I find this astounding.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIn a survey, 74 percent of women said\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthat miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd astoundingly, 22 percent\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nsaid they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo taboo number four:\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nyou can't say that your average happiness\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nhas declined since having a child.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nThe party line is that every single aspect of my life\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nhas just gotten dramatically better\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\never since I participated\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nin the miracle that is childbirth and family.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nour first son, Declan, was nine months old,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand I was sitting there on the couch,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, \"Stumbling on Happiness.\"\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd I got about two-thirds of the way through,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand there was a chart on the right-hand side --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\non the right-hand page --\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat we've labeled here\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\n\"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nfor a New Parent.\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThis chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nBasically, there's this precipitous drop\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof marital satisfaction,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwhich is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat doesn't rise again\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nuntil your first child goes to college.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthis chasm of happiness\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthat we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nWe were despondent.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nbut we'd come out of it,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand were really shocked to see this study.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo we really wanted to take a deeper look at it\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nin hopes that we would find a silver lining.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nRG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nbecause we got this incredible reporter\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nto go and interview all the scientists\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nwho conducted these four studies.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWe said, something is wrong here.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThere's something missing from these studies.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nIt can't possibly be that bad.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand she interviewed four scientists,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand we did indeed find a silver lining.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSo this is our guess\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nas to what this baseline of average happiness\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\narguably looks like throughout life.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAverage happiness is, of course, inadequate,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nbecause it doesn't speak\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto the moment-by-moment experience,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand so this is what we think it looks like\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwhen you layer in\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nmoment-to-moment experience.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd so we all remember as children,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthe tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nthe teeniest little thing\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\ncan just rocket them to these heights\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nof just utter adulation,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand then the next teeniest little thing\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\ncan cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd then, of course, as you get older,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nit's almost like age is a form of lithium.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAs you get older, you become more stable.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nis you start to learn to hedge your happiness.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nYou start to realize that\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n\"Hey, I could go to this live music event\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand have an utterly transforming

I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you \u2014 in just 15 minutes \u2014 that this isn't a flimsy idea, or a short-term trend, but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume, but how we consume.Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. Hands up \u2014 how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away? Can't see all the hands, but it looks like all of you, right? On our shelves at home, we have a box set of the DVD series \"24,\" season six to be precise. I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show. But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else. Now before we go on, I have a confession to make. I lived in New York for 10 years, and I am a big fan of \"Sex and the City.\" Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week. So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of \"24\" for a wanted copy of \"Sex and the City?\" Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading. Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's \"haves\" with person C's \"wants,\" whatever they may be.The other week, I went on one of these sites, appropriately called Swaptree, and there were over 59,300 items that I could instantly swap for my copy of \"24.\" Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her \"like new\" copy of \"Sex and the City\" for my copy of \"24.\" So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call \"the coincidence of wants,\" in approximately 60 seconds. What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot, because it knows the way of the item. Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree, but that's not my interest, and nor is swap trading, per se.My passion, and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching, is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems. When you think about it, it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago, that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully, and the one percent that receive a negative rating, it's for relatively minor reasons, like the item didn't arrive on time.So what's happening here? An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. Namely, that technology is enabling trust between strangers. We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face, but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. So what's actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back. We're bartering, trading, swapping, sharing, but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share, whether that's our neighborhood, our school, our office, or our Facebook network, and that's creating an economy of \"what's mine is yours.\" From the mighty eBay, the grandfather of exchange marketplaces, to car-sharing companies such as GoGet, where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour, to social lending platforms such as Zopa, that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend, and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world, we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. I call this \"groundswell collaborative consumption.\"Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from? Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said, \"I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,\" but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. Over the next minute, you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. The first thing I began to notice: how many big concepts were emerging \u2014 from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs \u2014 around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world \u2014 from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between \u2014 on what the power of numbers could achieve.Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere? That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators, to highly enabled collaborators. What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer. And the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. I mean, it's amazing to think that, in every single minute of this speech, 25 hours of YouTube video will be loaded. Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. And we were doing so for thousands of years, whether it's when we hunted in packs, or farmed in cooperatives, before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. But things are changing, and one of the reasons why is the digital natives, or Gen-Y. They're growing up sharing \u2014 files, video games, knowledge. It's second nature to them. So we, the millennials \u2014 I am just a millennial \u2014 are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of \"me\" to a culture of \"we.\"The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time, from a small device in our hands. All of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008, when, of course, the great financial crash happened. Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, \"No more.\" Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.So all of this is a lot of twittering, right? Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head, until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. One, a renewed belief in the importance of community, and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies, fundamentally changing the way we behave. Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns. And four, a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift \u2014 away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption. I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors \u2014 through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online \u2014 are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food, we are consuming and collaborating once again.So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. The first is redistribution markets. Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is. They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' \u2014 reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute \u2014 because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste.The second is collaborative lifestyles. This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time. I bet, in a couple of years, that phrases like \"coworking\" and \"couchsurfing\" and \"time banks\" are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. It's a scheme in the U.K. that matches Mr. Jones, with some spare space in his back garden, with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower. Together they grow their own food. It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant, you wonder why it's never been done before.Now, the third system is product-service systems. This is where you pay for the benefit of the product \u2014 what it does for you \u2014 without needing to own the product outright. This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity. And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to \u2014 how many of you have a power drill, own a power drill? Right. That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime. (Laughter) It's kind of ridiculous, right? Because what you need is the hole, not the drill. (Laughter) (Applause) So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it? These three systems are coming together, allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles, or their cherished personal freedoms. I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit.So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run. Yet, that car sits idle for 23 hours a day. So when you consider these two facts, it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. So this is where car-sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. In 2009, Zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities \u2014 and they're all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies \u2014 and got them to surrender their keys for a month. Instead, these people had to walk, bike, take the train, or other forms of public transport. They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. But my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back. In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own.Now products-service systems have been around for years. Just think of libraries and laundrettes. But I think they're entering a new age, because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said, \"Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the 8-track, what solar power is to the coal mine.\" I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries. I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves. I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays. In other words, I don't want stuff; I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions \u2014 or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it, \"where access is better than ownership.\"Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud, a blurry line is appearing between what's mine, what's yours, and what's ours. I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. This represents an eight-year time span. We've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet, to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental, where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor. Now all of these systems require a degree of trust, and the cornerstone to this working is reputation.Now in the old consumer system, our reputation didn't matter so much, because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review. But now with the Web, we leave a trail. With every spammer we flag, with every idea we post, comment we share, we're actually signaling how well we collaborate, and whether we can or can't be trusted. Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree. I can see that Rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate. In other words, I can trust him or her. Now mark my words, it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. It's a new social currency, so to speak, that could become as powerful as our credit rating.Now as a closing thought, I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste, and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak \u2014 when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough.Thank you very much.(Applause)",

sequel coming out next week.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nSo how easily could I swap\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nour unwanted copy of \"24\"\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nfor a wanted copy of \"Sex and the City?\"\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow you may have noticed\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthere's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nNow the easiest analogy for swap-trading\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nis like an online dating service\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nfor all your unwanted media.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nWhat it does is use the Internet\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nto create an infinite marketplace\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nto match person A's \"haves\"\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nwith person C's \"wants,\"\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwhatever they may be.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nThe other week, I went on one of these sites,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nappropriately called Swaptree,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand there were over 59,300 items\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nthat I could instantly swap\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nfor my copy of \"24.\"\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nLo and behold,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthere in Reseda, CA was Rondoron\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwho wanted swap his or her\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\n\"like new\" copy of \"Sex and the City\"\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nfor my copy of \"24.\"\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo in other words, what's happening here\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nis that Swaptree\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nsolves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\na problem the economists call \"the coincidence of wants,\"\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nin approximately 60 seconds.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWhat's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nbecause it knows the way of the item.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nNow there are layers of technical wonder\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nbehind sites such as Swaptree,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut that's not my interest,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand nor is swap trading, per se.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nMy passion, and what I've spent the last few years\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\ndedicated to researching,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nis the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\ninherent in these systems.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWhen you think about it,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nit would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat I would swap my stuff with a total stranger\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nwhose real name I didn't know\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand without any money changing hands.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nhappen successfully,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand the one percent that receive a negative rating,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nit's for relatively minor reasons,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nlike the item didn't arrive on time.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nSo what's happening here?\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAn extremely powerful dynamic\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nthat has huge commercial and cultural implications\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nis at play.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNamely, that technology\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nis enabling\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\ntrust between strangers.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nWe now live in a global village\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhere we can mimic the ties\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthat used to happen face to face,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut on a scale and in ways\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat have never been possible before.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo what's actually happening\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis that social networks and real-time technologies\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nare taking us back.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe're bartering, trading,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nswapping, sharing,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbut they're being reinvented\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ninto dynamic and appealing forms.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nWhat I find fascinating\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nis that we've actually wired our world to share,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwhether that's our neighborhood, our school,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nour office, or our Facebook network,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand that's creating an economy\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nof \"what's mine is yours.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nFrom the mighty eBay,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthe grandfather of exchange marketplaces,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nto car-sharing companies such as GoGet,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhere you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nto social lending platforms such as Zopa,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat will take anyone in this audience\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nwith 100 dollars to lend,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nwe're sharing and collaborating again\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin ways that I believe\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nare more hip than hippie.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI call this \"groundswell collaborative consumption.\"\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nNow before I dig into the different systems\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nof collaborative consumption,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nI'd like to try and answer the question\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat every author rightfully gets asked,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich is, where did this idea come from?\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNow I'd like to say I woke up one morning\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand said, \"I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbut actually it was a complicated web\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nof seemingly disconnected ideas.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nOver the next minute,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nyou're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nof all the dots that went on in my head.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThe first thing I began to notice:\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nhow many big concepts were emerging --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nfrom the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\naround how ridiculously easy it is\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nto form groups for a purpose.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd linked to this crowd mania\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nwere examples all around the world --\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nfrom the election of a president\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\non what the power of numbers could achieve.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nNow, you know when you learn a new word,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then you start to see that word everywhere?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThat's what happened to me\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhen I noticed that we are moving\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nfrom passive consumers\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nto creators,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto highly enabled collaborators.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nWhat's happening\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nis the Internet is removing the middleman,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nso that anyone from a T-shirt designer\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nto a knitter\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\ncan make a living selling peer-to-peer.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the ubiquitous force\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nof this peer-to-peer revolution\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nmeans that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nI mean, it's amazing to think\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat, in every single minute of this speech,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\n25 hours\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nof YouTube video will be loaded.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow what I find fascinating about these examples\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis how they're actually tapping into\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nour primate instincts.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI mean, we're monkeys,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand we're born and bred to share and cooperate.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd we were doing so for thousands of years,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhether it's when we hunted in packs,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nor farmed in cooperatives,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nbefore this big system called hyper-consumption came along\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand we built these fences\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand created out own little fiefdoms.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nBut things are changing,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand one of the reasons why\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nis the digital natives, or Gen-Y.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThey're growing up sharing --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nfiles, video games, knowledge.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nIt's second nature to them.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nare like foot soldiers,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmoving us from a culture of \"me\" to a culture of \"we.\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThe reason why it's happening so fast\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nis because of mobile collaboration.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe now live in a connected age\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhere we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nfrom a small device in our hands.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAll of this was going through my head\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\ntowards the end of 2008,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nwhen, of course, the great financial crash happened.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand he poignantly commented\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat 2008 is when we hit a wall,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nwhen Mother Nature and the market\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nboth said, \"No more.\"\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nNow we rationally know\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthat an economy built on hyper-consumption\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nYet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo all of this is a lot of twittering, right?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nWell it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nuntil actually I realized it was happening\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nbecause of four key drivers.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nOne, a renewed belief in the importance of community,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nand a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nA torrent of peer-to-peer social networks\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand real-time technologies,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nfundamentally changing the way we behave.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThree, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd four, a global recession\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthat has fundamentally shocked\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nconsumer behaviors.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThese four drivers\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nare fusing together\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand creating the big shift --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\naway from the 20th century,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ndefined by hyper-consumption,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\ntowards the 21st century,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ndefined by collaborative consumption.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI generally believe we're at an inflection point\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhere the sharing behaviors --\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthrough sites such as Flickr and Twitter\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat are becoming second nature online --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nare being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nFrom morning commutes to the way fashion is designed\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto the way we grow food,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwe are consuming and collaborating once again.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nhave actually gathered thousands of examples\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nfrom all around the world of collaborative consumption.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd although they vary enormously\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nin scale, maturity and purpose,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhen we dived into them,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwe realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThe first is redistribution markets.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nRedistribution markets, just like Swaptree,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nare when you take a used, or pre-owned, item\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand move it from where it's not needed\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nto somewhere, or someone, where it is.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThey're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nreduce, reuse, recycle, repair\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand redistribute --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nbecause they stretch the life cycle of a product\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand thereby reduce waste.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThe second is collaborative lifestyles.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThis is the sharing of resources\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nof things like money, skills and time.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI bet, in a couple of years,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthat phrases like \"coworking\"\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand \"couchsurfing\" and \"time banks\"\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nare going to become a part of everyday vernacular.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nOne of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nis called Landshare.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nIt's a scheme in the U.K.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat matches Mr. Jones,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwith some spare space in his back garden,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwith Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nTogether they grow their own food.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nIt's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nyou wonder why it's never been done before.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nNow, the third system\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nis product-service systems.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThis is where you pay for the benefit of the product --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwhat it does for you --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwithout needing to own the product outright.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nThis idea is particularly powerful\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nfor things that have\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nhigh-idling capacity.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd that can be anything from baby goods\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nto fashions to --\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nhow many of you have a power drill,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nown a power drill? Right.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThat power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nin its entire lifetime.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIt's kind of ridiculous, right?\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nBecause what you need is the hole, not the drill.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo why don't you rent the drill,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nor, even better, rent out your own drill to other people\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand make some money from it?\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThese three systems are coming together,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nallowing people to share resources\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nwithout sacrificing their lifestyles,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nor their cherished personal freedoms.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI'm not asking people\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nto share nicely in the sandpit.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nSo I want to just give you an example\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nof how powerful collaborative consumption can be\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nto change behaviors.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThe average car\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\ncosts 8,000 dollars a year to run.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nYet, that car sits idle\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nfor 23 hours a day.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo when you consider these two facts,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nit starts to make a little less sense\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthat we have to own one outright.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nSo this is where car-sharing companies\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nsuch as Zipcar and GoGet come in.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIn 2009,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nZipcar took 250 participants\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nfrom across 13 cities --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand they're all self-confessed car addicts\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand car-sharing rookies --\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand got them to surrender their keys for a month.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nInstead, these people had to walk,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nbike, take the train,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nor other forms of public transport.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThey could only use their Zipcar membership\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwhen absolutely necessary.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nThe results of this challenge after just one month\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwas staggering.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nIt's amazing that 413 lbs were lost\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\njust from the extra exercise.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nBut my favorite statistic\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nis that 100\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nout of the 250 participants\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\ndid not want their keys back.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nIn other words, the car addicts\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nhad lost their urge to own.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nNow products-service systems have been around for years.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nJust think of libraries and laundrettes.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nBut I think they're entering a new age,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbecause technology makes sharing\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nfrictionless and fun.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nThere's a great quote that was written in the New York Times\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nthat said, \"Sharing is to ownership\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwhat the iPod is to the 8-track,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwhat solar power is to the coal mine.\"\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nI believe also, our generation,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nour relationship to satisfying what we want\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nis far less tangible\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthan any other previous generation.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nI don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nI don't want a clunky answering machine;\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nI want the message it saves.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIn other words, I don't want stuff;\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nI want the needs or experiences it fulfills.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThis is fueling a massive shift\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nfrom where usage trumps possessions --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nor as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n\"where access is better than ownership.\"\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nNow as our possessions\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\ndematerialize into the cloud,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\na blurry line is appearing\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nbetween what's mine, what's yours,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand what's ours.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI want to give you one example\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat shows how fast this evolution is happening.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThis represents an eight-year time span.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nWe've gone from traditional car-ownership\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nto car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nto ride-sharing platforms that match rides\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nto the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhere you can actually make money\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nout of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nto your neighbor.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nNow all of these systems\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nrequire a degree of trust,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nand the cornerstone to this working\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nis reputation.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nNow in the old consumer system,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nour reputation didn't matter so much,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbecause our credit history was far more important\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthat any kind of peer-to-peer review.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nBut now with the Web, we leave a trail.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWith every spammer we flag,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nwith every idea we post, comment we share,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nwe're actually signaling how well we collaborate,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand whether we can or can't be trusted.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nLet's go back to my first example,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSwaptree.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nI can see that Rondoron\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nhas completed 553 trades\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwith a 100 percent success rate.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIn other words, I can trust him or her.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nNow mark my words,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nit's only a matter of time\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nbefore we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand see a cumulative picture\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nof our reputation capital.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd this reputation capital\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nwill determine our access to collaborative consumption.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nIt's a new social currency, so to speak,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nthat could become as powerful as our credit rating.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nNow as a closing thought,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI believe we're actually in a period\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwhere we're waking up\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nfrom this humongous hangover\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nof emptiness and waste,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nand we're taking a leap\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto create a more sustainable system\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbuilt to serve our innate needs\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nfor community and individual identity.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nI believe it will be referred to\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nas a revolution, so to speak --\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nwhen society, faced with great challenges,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nmade a seismic shift\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nfrom individual getting and spending\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ntowards a rediscovery of collective good.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nI'm on a mission to make sharing cool.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nI'm on a mission to make sharing hip.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nBecause I really believe\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nit can disrupt outdated modes of business,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nhelp us leapfrog\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nover wasteful forms of hyper-consumption\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand teach us when enough really is enough.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Life lessons from big cats", "duration": "1040", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/beverly_dereck_joubert_life_lessons_from_big_cats", "transcript": "Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness, and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats? Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character \u2014 this leopard.Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of \"CSI\" \u2014 something like 28 years. In essence, what we've done is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior, we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals. But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality, that individual personality that these animals have. And here's a prime example. We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in Africa, the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us \u2014 her own daughter, eight days old. And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years \u2014 following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her. Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters. (Laughter) Beverly's clearly one of them, and this little leopard, Legadema, is another, and she changed our lives.BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her \u2014 in fact, more time than even her mother did. When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film. And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us. It was frightening, and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. And of course, we were stunned for a while, but when we managed to get our wits about us, we looked at it and said, \"My gosh, what's going to happen with that little cub? She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us.\" Well, we needn't have worried. She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out. And actually from that day on, she's been comfortable with us. So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. We called her Legadema, which means, \"light from the sky.\"DJ: Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals, in particular in the cats. This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, \"he who greets with fire,\" and you can just see that about him, you know \u2014 that's his character. But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have.BJ: But through our investigation, we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating. But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory. But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us. And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go \u2014 not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly \u2014 and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves. But we've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others, and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.BJ: And then of course, the challenge is knowing when to turn around. We don't always get that right, and on this particular day, we seriously underestimated the depth. We got deeper and deeper, until it was at Dereck's chest-height. Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle. We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine.DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. (Laughter) You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly \u2014 the dry top angle, by the way. (Laughter) But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us, and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.BJ: But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. And 20 years ago, we did a film called \"Eternal Enemies\" where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species \u2014 lions and hyenas. And surprisingly, it became a cult film. And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare.DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents. He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it. (Animal sounds) But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere. This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, \"That's wrong, and that's right.\" But that's not always easy for us.BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes \u2014 extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night. Sleep deprivation is extreme. We're on the edge through a large part of the time. But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together \u2014 and never ever managed until this particular night. And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. I had tears rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking with anxiety, but I knew that [I had] to capture something that had never been seen before, had never been documented. And I do believe you should stay with us.DJ: The amazing thing about these moments \u2014 and this is probably a highlight of our career \u2014 is that you never know how it's going to end. Many people believe, in fact, that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart, not in the lungs, and that's when people give up hope, or when any life form gives up hope. And you can see the start of it here. This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope. But by the same token, you can get your hope back again. So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight \u2014 that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have. Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.(Applause)Now back to the leopard. We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. We were perhaps taking her for granted, and maybe she didn't like that that much. This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I. Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is, and I'm on the other side where my space is. These are precious to us, these divides.BJ: But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear, she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. But at the same time, we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car, it might not turn out the same way \u2014 she might get shot for that. So we knew we had to react quickly. And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make \u2014 a hiss and a sound. So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car \u2014 very innovative.DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see. (Laughter) But really and truly, this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her, when she started hunting.BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited. It was like watching a graduation ceremony. We felt like we were surrogate parents. And of course, we knew now that she was going to survive. But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent, it didn't turn and run. So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety, protecting it from the hyena. And over the next five hours, she took care of it. We realized that we actually don't know everything, and that nature is so unpredictable, we have to be open at all times.DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. (Laughter) But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting. Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother. She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality.BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together. They ended up sleeping for hours. But I have to tell you \u2014 everybody always asks, \"What happened to the baby baboon?\" It did die, and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant. We had to deal with these individual personalities. We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved \u2014 and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000. Tigers haven't fared any better \u2014 45,000 down to maybe 3,000.BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000. Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000. Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema \u2014 which is really over a five-year period \u2014 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount. It's simply not sustainable. We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power. It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers. And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade. South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions. So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. I call it complacency \u2014 our complacency. Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on that we're all aware of, that we condone. And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today.BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride. A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. So we've estimated that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far-off place.DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. They're essential to the habitat. If they disappear, whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. If they disappear, all of that goes away. But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature, as we de-link ourselves spiritually from these animals, we lose hope, we lose that spiritual connection, our dignity, that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet.BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness. And so what we are doing, in February, we're bringing out a film called \"The Last Lion,\" and \"The Last Lion\" is exactly what is happening right now. That is the situation we're in \u2014 the last lions. That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear. And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by \u2014 that conservation was all about respect and celebration \u2014 is probably true. That's really what it needs. We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that.And Legadema? Well we can report, in fact, that we're grandparents.(Laughter)BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1039, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958

wilderness,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand so what we've done\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nis we've focused on iconic cats.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAnd I know,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nin the light of human suffering and poverty\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand even climate change,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\none would wonder,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nwhy worry about a few cats?\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nWell today we're here\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nto share with you a message that we have learned\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nfrom a very important and special character --\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nthis leopard.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nDereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nlike a super long episode of \"CSI\" --\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nsomething like 28 years.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nIn essence, what we've done\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nis we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nwe've seen over 2,000 kills\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nby these amazing animals.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nBut one of the things that science really lets us down on\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nis that personality,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat individual personality that these animals have.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd here's a prime example.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nWe found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbaobab tree in Africa,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthe same tree that we found her mother in\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand her grandmother.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd she took us on a journey\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nand revealed something very special to us --\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nher own daughter, eight days old.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd the minute we found this leopard,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nwe realized that we needed to move in,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand so we basically stayed with this leopard\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nfor the next four-and-a-half years --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nfollowing her every day,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\ngetting to know her,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthat individual personality of hers,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand really coming to know her.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nNow I'm destined\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nto spend a lot of time\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nwith some unique,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nvery, very special,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nindividualistic\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand often seductive female characters.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nBeverly's clearly one of them,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand this little leopard, Legadema, is another,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nand she changed our lives.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her --\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nin fact, more time than even her mother did.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nWhen her mother would go off hunting,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwe would stay and film.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\n20 paces away from us.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt was frightening,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nand it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd of course, we were stunned for a while,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nbut when we managed to get our wits about us,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwe looked at it and said, \"My gosh,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhat's going to happen with that little cub?\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nShe's probably going to forever associate\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthat deafening crash with us.\"\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWell, we needn't have worried.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nShe came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nsat next to us, shivering,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwith her back towards Dereck, and looking out.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd actually from that day on,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nshe's been comfortable with us.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSo we felt that that day\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwas the day that she really earned her name.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nWe called her Legadema,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich means, \"light from the sky.\"\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nDJ: Now we've found these individualisms\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin all sorts of animals,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nin particular in the cats.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\n\"he who greets with fire,\"\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut only by getting up close to these animals\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand spending time with them\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\ncan we actually even reach out\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand dig out these personal characters that they have.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nBJ: But through our investigation,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwe have to seek the wildest places in Africa.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd right now this is in the Okavango Delta\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nin Botswana.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nYes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbut I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut also, our hearts are in our throats\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\na huge amount of the time,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nbecause we're driving through water,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand it's an unknown territory.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nBut we're really there\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nseeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nDJ: Now one of the big things, of course,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\neverybody knows that cats hate water,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand so this was a real revelation for us.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd we could only find this by pushing ourselves,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nby going where no sane person should go --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nnot without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand just pushing the envelope,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\ngoing out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nBut we've managed to find that these lions\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nare 15 percent bigger than any others,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nand they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBJ: And then of course, the challenge\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis knowing when to turn around.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWe don't always get that right,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand on this particular day,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwe seriously underestimated the depth.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe got deeper and deeper,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nuntil it was at Dereck's chest-height.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWell then we hit a deep depression,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand we seriously submerged the vehicle.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nWe actually managed to drown\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\ntwo million dollars' worth of camera gear.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nWe drowned our pride, I must tell you,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwhich was really serious,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand we seized the engine.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nDJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nis that he who drowns the vehicle\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ngets to swim with the crocodiles.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nYou will notice also that all of these images here\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nare taken from the top angle by Beverly --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthe dry top angle, by the way.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut all the places we get stuck in really have great views.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand Beverly was able to get a great photograph.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nBJ: But we truly do\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nspend day and night\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ntrying to capture unique footage.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd 20 years ago,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwe did a film called \"Eternal Enemies\"\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nwhere we managed to capture\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nthis unusual disturbing behavior across two species --\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nlions and hyenas.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd surprisingly, it became a cult film.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd we can only work that out\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nas people were seeing parallels\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nbetween the thuggish side of nature\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand gang warfare.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nDJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nis doing exactly what his name,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nEetwidomayloh, represents.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nHe's focused on this hyena,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand he is going to get it.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\n(Animal sounds)\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nBut that's, I think, what this is all about,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nis that these individuals have these personalities and characters.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBut for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbut we live by certain rules of engagement,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwhich mean we can't interfere.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThis sort of behavior has been going on\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nfor three, four, five million years,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand we can't step in and say, \"That's wrong, and that's right.\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBut that's not always easy for us.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBJ: So, as Dereck says,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwe have to work through extremes --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nextreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSleep deprivation is extreme.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nWe're on the edge\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthrough a large part of the time.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nBut, for 10 years, we tried to capture\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nlions and elephants together --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand never ever managed\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nuntil this particular night.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd I have to tell you\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthat it was a disturbing night for me.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nI had tears rolling down my cheeks.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI was shaking with anxiety,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nbut I knew that [I had] to capture something\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat had never been seen before, had never been documented.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd I do believe you should stay with us.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nDJ: The amazing thing about these moments --\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand this is probably a highlight of our career --\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nis that you never know how it's going to end.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nMany people believe, in fact,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthat death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nnot in the lungs,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand that's when people give up hope,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nor when any life form gives up hope.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd you can see the start of it here.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThis elephant, against overwhelming odds,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nsimply gives up hope.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBut by the same token,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nyou can get your hope back again.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo just when you think it's all over, something else happens,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nsome spark gets into you,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nsome sort of will to fight --\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthat iron will that we all have,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthat this elephant has,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthat conservation has, that big cats have.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nEverything has that will to survive,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nto fight, to push through that mental barrier\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand to keep going.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd for us, in many ways,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthis elephant has become\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\na symbol of inspiration for us,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\na symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nNow back to the leopard.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nWe were spending so much time with this leopard\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand getting to understand her individualism,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nher personal character,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nthat maybe we were taking it a little bit far.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWe were perhaps taking her for granted,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand maybe she didn't like that that much.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis is about couples working together,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand so I do need to say that within the vehicle\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwe have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nBeverly sits on the one side\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwhere all her camera gear is,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand I'm on the other side where my space is.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThese are precious to us, these divides.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBJ: But when this little cub saw\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthat I had vacated my seat\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand climbed to the back to get some camera gear,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nshe came in like a curious cat\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nto come and investigate.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nIt was phenomenal, and we felt grateful\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthat she trusted us to that extent.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nBut at the same time, we were concerned\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthat if she created this as a habit\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand jumped into somebody else's car,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nit might not turn out the same way --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nshe might get shot for that.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo we knew we had to react quickly.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd the only way we thought we could\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwithout scaring her\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nis to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\na hiss and a sound.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nvery innovative.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nDJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbecause Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut really and truly, this was how\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthis little leopard was displaying\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nher individual personality.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nBut nothing prepared us\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nfor what happened next in our relationship with her,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwhen she started hunting.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was like watching a graduation ceremony.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWe felt like we were surrogate parents.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd of course, we knew now\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthat she was going to survive.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBut only when we saw the tiny baby baboon\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nclinging to the mother's fur\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ndid we realize that something very unique\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwas taking place here with Legadema.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nit didn't turn and run.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo what we watched\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nover the next couple of hours\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwas very unique.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIt was absolutely amazing\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nwhen she picked it up to safety,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nprotecting it from the hyena.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd over the next five hours,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nshe took care of it.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nWe realized that we actually don't know everything,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand that nature is so unpredictable,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwe have to be open at all times.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nDJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nBut in fact,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwhat we were seeing here was interesting.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBecause she is a cub wanting to play,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nbut she was also a predator needing to kill,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand yet conflicted in some way,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbecause she was also an emerging mother.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nShe had this maternal instinct,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nmuch like a young girl on her way to womanhood,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand so this really took us to this new level\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nof understanding that personality.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nBJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThey ended up sleeping for hours.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nBut I have to tell you --\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\neverybody always asks, \"What happened to the baby baboon?\"\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nIt did die,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nDJ: So at this stage, I guess,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwe had very, very firm ideas\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\non what conservation meant.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nWe had to deal with these individual personalities.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe had to deal with them with respect\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand celebrate them.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nto march forward into conservation,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\ntaking care of the big cats that we loved --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nto see how well we had all collectively been doing.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo when Beverly and I were born,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthere were 450,000 lions,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand today there are 20,000.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nTigers haven't fared any better --\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\n45,000\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\ndown to maybe 3,000.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nBJ: And then cheetahs have crashed\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nall the way down to 12,000.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nLeopards have plummeted\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nfrom 700,000\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\ndown to a mere 50,000.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nNow in the extraordinary time\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthat we have worked with Legadema --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwhich is really over a five-year period --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n10,000 leopards were legally shot\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nby safari hunters.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd that's not the only leopards\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthat were being killed through that period.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThere's an immense amount of poaching as well,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand so possibly the same amount.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIt's simply not sustainable.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nWe admire them,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand we fear them,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand yet, as man, we want to steal their power.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nIt used to be the time\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwhere only kings wore a leopard skin,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nbut now throughout rituals and ceremonies,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\ntraditional healers and ministers.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd of course, looking at this lion paw\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat has been skinned,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nit eerily reminds me\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nof a human hand,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nDJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nSouth Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nLion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand so in a stroke, the lion bone industry\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nis going to wipe out all the tigers.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nSo we have a real problem here,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nno more so than the lions do, the male lions.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nSo the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nis actually a red herring,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nbecause there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand they all are actually\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\ninfected with the same disease.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nI call it complacency --\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nour complacency.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nBecause there's a sport, there's an activity going on\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthat we're all aware of, that we condone.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd that's probably because we haven't seen it\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nlike we are today.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nBJ: And you have to know\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthat, when a male lion is killed,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nit completely disrupts the whole pride.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nA new male comes into the area\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand takes over the pride,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nand, of course, first of all kills all the cubs\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo we've estimated\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwhen one lion is hanging on a wall\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nsomewhere in a far-off place.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nDJ: So what our investigations have shown\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nis that these lions are essential.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nThey're essential to the habitat.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nIf they disappear,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nwhole ecosystems in Africa disappear.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThere's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\necotourism revenue stream into Africa.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo this is not just a concern about lions;\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nit's a concern about communities in Africa as well.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nIf they disappear, all of that goes away.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBut what I'm more concerned about in many ways\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nis that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nas we de-link ourselves spiritually\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nfrom these animals,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nwe lose hope,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nwe lose that spiritual connection,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nour dignity, that thing within us\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nthat keeps us connected to the planet.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nBJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nof lions and leopards right now,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nit is all about critical awareness.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nAnd so what we are doing,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nin February, we're bringing out a film called \"The Last Lion,\"\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nand \"The Last Lion\" is exactly\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nwhat is happening right now.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThat is the situation we're in --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nthe last lions.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThat is, if we don't take action and do something,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nthese plains will be completely devoid\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nof big cats,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand then, in turn, everything else will disappear.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nAnd simply, if we can't protect them,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nwe're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nDJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand designed our lives by --\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nthat conservation was all about respect\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand celebration --\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nis probably true. That's really what it needs.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nWe need it. We respect and celebrate each other\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nas a man and a woman, as a community\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nand as part of this planet,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand we need to continue that.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nAnd Legadema?\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nWell we can report, in fact,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nthat we're grandparents.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nBJ/DJ: Thank you very much.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:09.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why we have too few women leaders", "duration": "898", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders", "transcript": "So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them. But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem. And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 190 heads of state \u2014 nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats \u2014 tops out at 15, 16 percent. The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent.We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting \u2014 it's about a three-hour meeting \u2014 and two hours in, there needs to be that bio break, and everyone stands up, and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. And so I said, \"Did you just move into this office?\" And he said, \"No, we've been here about a year.\" And I said, \"Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?\" And he looked at me, and he said, \"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom.\"(Laughter)So the question is, how are we going to fix this? How do we change these numbers at the top? How do we make this different? I want to start out by saying, I talk about this \u2014 about keeping women in the workforce \u2014 because I really think that's the answer. In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top \u2014 Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries \u2014 the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important. Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves? What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us? What are the messages we tell our daughters?Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, \"Mommy, don't get on the plane\" thing. This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce, who don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone.My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three. One, sit at the table. Two, make your partner a real partner. And three, don't leave before you leave. Number one: sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook, we hosted a very senior government official, and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department, and I kind of said to them, \"Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table,\" and they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college, my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History. Don't you love that kind of thing from college? I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate, Carrie, who was then a brilliant literary student \u2014 and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar \u2014 and my brother \u2014 smart guy, but a water-polo-playing pre-med, who was a sophomore.The three of us take this class together. And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin, goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother is kind of busy. He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures, marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down. And we sit there for three hours \u2014 and our little blue notebooks \u2014 yes, I'm that old. We walk out, we look at each other, and we say, \"How did you do?\" And Carrie says, \"Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic.\" And I say, \"God, I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow.\" And my brother says, \"I got the top grade in the class.\"(Laughter)\"You got the top grade in the class? You don't know anything.\"(Laughter)The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows: women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women. And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, \"I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking?\" If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard. Why does this matter? Boy, it matters a lot. Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side, not at the table, and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success, or they don't even understand their own success.I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for, these fabulous women, \"Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.\" I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple. Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true.There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley, and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In 2002 \u2014 not so long ago \u2014 a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it [Howard] Roizen. And he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word: \"Heidi\" to \"Howard.\" But that one word made a really big difference. He then surveyed the students, and the good news was the students, both men and women, thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent, and that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him. You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi? Not so sure. She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues, we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table, and we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not.The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me, but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me. I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked. And she said, \"I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up.\" \"What do you mean?\" She said, \"You're giving this talk, and you said you would take two more questions. I had my hand up with many other people, and you took two more questions. I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same, and then you took more questions, only from the men.\" And I thought to myself, \"Wow, if it's me \u2014 who cares about this, obviously \u2014 giving this talk \u2014 and during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised, and the women's hands are still raised, how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women?\" We've got to get women to sit at the table.(Cheers)(Applause)Message number two: Make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child, the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does, and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more? The causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.I think the cause is more complicated. I think, as a society, we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers, and it's hard. When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there, I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem, because we have to make it as important a job, because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home, for people of both genders, if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.(Applause)Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there, they also have more \u2014 how shall I say this on this stage? They know each other more in the biblical sense as well.(Cheers)Message number three: Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking \u2014 and I see this all the time \u2014 with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. Here's what happens: We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. And she starts thinking about having a child, and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child. \"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?\" And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, \"Me. I want to do that.\" She starts leaning back. The problem is that \u2014 let's say she got pregnant that day, that day \u2014 nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave, six months to catch your breath \u2014 Fast-forward two years, more often \u2014 and as I've seen it \u2014 women start thinking about this way earlier \u2014 when they get engaged, or married, when they start thinking about having a child, which can take a long time. One woman came to see me about this. She looked a little young. And I said, \"So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?\" And she said, \"Oh no, I'm not married.\" She didn't even have a boyfriend.(Laughter)I said, \"You're thinking about this just way too early.\"But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back? Everyone who's been through this \u2014 and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back, because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did, if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal, until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child \u2014 and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance, particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.My generation really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top. They're just not moving. We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population \u2014 in my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women] at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women, would be a better world. It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are, even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1040, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.299\nSo for any of us in this room today,\nlet's start out by admitting we're lucky.\n\n00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:20.150\nWe don't live in the world\nour mothers lived in,\n\n00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:21.413\nour grandmothers lived in,\n\n00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:23.925\nwhere career choices\nfor women were so limited.\n\n00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:25.934\nAnd if you're in this room today,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:30.702\nmost of us grew up in a world\nwhere we have basic civil rights,\n\n00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:34.649\nand amazingly, we still live in a world\nwhere some women don't have them.\n\n00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.044\nBut all that aside,\nwe still have a problem,\n\n00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:39.283\nand it's a real problem.\n\n00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:40.934\nAnd the problem is this:\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.130\nWomen are not making it\nto the top of any profession\n\n00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:46.526\nanywhere in the world.\n\n00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:49.485\nThe numbers tell the story quite clearly.\n\n00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:52.547\n190 heads of state --\nnine are women.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.424\nOf all the people\nin parliament in the world,\n\n00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:57.297\n13 percent are women.\n\n00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.600\nIn the corporate sector, women at the top,\n\n00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:02.934\nC-level jobs, board seats --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.699\ntops out at 15, 16 percent.\n\n00:01:05.723 --> 00:01:08.675\nThe numbers have not moved since 2002\n\n00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:10.648\nand are going in the wrong direction.\n\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.302\nAnd even in the non-profit world,\n\n00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:16.598\na world we sometimes think of\nas being led by more women,\n\n00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:18.934\nwomen at the top: 20 percent.\n\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.398\nWe also have another problem,\n\n00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:23.812\nwhich is that women face harder choices\n\n00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:26.934\nbetween professional success\nand personal fulfillment.\n\n00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:32.479\nA recent study in the U.S.\nshowed that, of married senior managers,\n\n00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.934\ntwo-thirds of the married men had children\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.664\nand only one-third\nof the married women had children.\n\n00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:40.637\nA couple of years ago, I was in New York,\n\n00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:42.117\nand I was pitching a deal,\n\n00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.492\nand I was in one of those fancy\nNew York private equity offices\n\n00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:46.689\nyou can picture.\n\n00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:49.523\nAnd I'm in the meeting --\nit's about a three-hour meeting --\n\n00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:52.706\nand two hours in,\nthere needs to be that bio break,\n\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.537\nand everyone stands up,\n\n00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.847\nand the partner running the meeting\nstarts looking really embarrassed.\n\n00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.492\nAnd I realized he doesn't know\nwhere the women's room is in his office.\n\n00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:05.059\nSo I start looking\naround for moving boxes,\n\n00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.369\nfiguring they just moved in,\nbut I don't see any.\n\n00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.337\nAnd so I said, \"Did you just\nmove into this office?\"\n\n00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:12.957\nAnd he said, \"No,\nwe've been here about a year.\"\n\n00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:17.688\nAnd I said, \"Are you telling me\nthat I am the only woman\n\n00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:20.494\nto have pitched a deal\nin this office in a year?\"\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.544\nAnd he looked at me, and he said,\n\n00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:26.149\n\"Yeah.

I feel guilty sometimes.\n\n00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:48.934\nI know no women,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.768\nwhether they're at home\nor whether they're in the workforce,\n\n00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:53.331\nwho don't feel that sometimes.\n\n00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:55.934\nSo I'm not saying\nthat staying in the workforce\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.783\nis the right thing for everyone.\n\n00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.934\nMy talk today is about\nwhat the messages are\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.315\nif you do want to stay in the workforce,\n\n00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:04.934\nand I think there are three.\n\n00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:07.461\nOne, sit at the table.\n\n00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:10.272\nTwo, make your partner a real partner.\n\n00:04:11.164 --> 00:04:14.934\nAnd three, don't leave before you leave.\n\n00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.216\nNumber one: sit at the table.\n\n00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:19.637\nJust a couple weeks ago at Facebook,\n\n00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:21.934\nwe hosted a very senior\ngovernment official,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.179\nand he came in to meet with senior execs\n\n00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:26.804\nfrom around Silicon Valley.\n\n00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:29.494\nAnd everyone kind of sat at the table.\n\n00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:32.090\nHe had these two women\nwho were traveling with him\n\n00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:33.934\npretty senior in his department,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.244\nand I kind of said to them,\n\n00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:37.482\n\"Sit at the table.\nCome on, sit at the table,\"\n\n00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.269\nand they sat on the side of the room.\n\n00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.443\nWhen I was in college, my senior year,\n\n00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:44.966\nI took a course called\nEuropean Intellectual History.\n\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.197\nDon't you love that kind\nof thing from college?\n\n00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:48.934\nI wish I could do that now.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.934\nAnd I took it with my roommate, Carrie,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.498\nwho was then a brilliant\nliterary student --\n\n00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:55.832\nand went on to be a brilliant\nliterary scholar --\n\n00:04:55.856 --> 00:04:57.873\nand my brother -- smart guy,\n\n00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.512\nbut a water-polo-playing pre-med,\n\n00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:00.934\nwho was a sophomore.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.934\nThe three of us take this class together.\n\n00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:07.692\nAnd then Carrie reads all the books\nin the original Greek and Latin,\n\n00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:09.408\ngoes to all the lectures.\n\n00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.482\nI read all the books in English\n\n00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:13.163\nand go to most of the lectures.\n\n00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:14.934\nMy brother is kind of busy.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.670\nHe reads one book of 12\nand goes to a couple of lectures,\n\n00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:21.741\nmarches himself up to our room\n\n00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:24.242\na couple days before the exam\nto get himself tutored.\n\n00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.496\nThe three of us go to the exam\ntogether, and we sit down.\n\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.679\nAnd we sit there for three hours --\n\n00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:32.084\nand our little blue notebooks\n-- yes, I'm that old.\n\n00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:35.323\nWe walk out, we look at each other,\nand we say, \"How did you do?\"\n\n00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:38.824\nAnd Carrie says, \"Boy, I feel like\nI didn't really draw out the main point\n\n00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:40.423\non the Hegelian dialectic.\"\n\n00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:43.372\nAnd I say, \"God, I really\nwish I had really connected\n\n00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:46.611\nJohn Locke's theory of property\nwith the philosophers that follow.\"\n\n00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:48.139\nAnd my brother says,\n\n00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:50.078\n\"I got the top grade in the class.\"\n\n00:05:50.102 --> 00:05:52.047\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:54.167\n\"You got the top grade in the class?\n\n00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.741\nYou don't know

00:06:05.251\nwomen systematically\nunderestimate their own abilities.\n\n00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:06.934\nIf you test men and women,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.552\nand you ask them questions\non totally objective criteria like GPAs,\n\n00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:12.440\nmen get it wrong slightly high,\n\n00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:14.551\nand women get it wrong slightly low.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.934\nWomen do not negotiate\nfor themselves in the workforce.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.934\nA study in the last two years\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.575\nof people entering\nthe

themselves,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.612\nand women attribute it\nto other external factors.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.331\nIf you ask men why they did a good job,\n\n00:06:42.355 -->

Why are you even asking?\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.934\nIf you ask women why they did a good job,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.934\nwhat they'll say is someone helped them,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.934\nthey got lucky, they worked really hard.\n\n00:06:54.604 --> 00:06:55.934\nWhy does this matter?\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.934\nBoy, it matters a lot.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.934\nBecause no one gets to the corner office\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.512\nby sitting on the side, not at the table,\n\n00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:05.539\nand no one gets the promotion\n\n00:07:05.563 --> 00:07:08.118\nif they don't think\nthey deserve their success,\n\n00:07:08.142 --> 00:07:10.934\nor they don't even understand\ntheir own success.\n\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.574\nI wish the answer were easy.\n\n00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:16.210\nI wish I could go tell\nall the young women I work for,\n\n00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:17.248\nthese fabulous women,\n\n00:07:17.272 --> 00:07:19.522\n\"Believe in yourself\nand negotiate for yourself.\n\n00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:20.934\nOwn your own success.\"\n\n00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:23.360\nI wish I could tell that to my daughter.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.563\nBut it's not that simple.\n\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.438\nBecause what the data shows,\nabove all else, is one thing,\n\n00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:33.763\nwhich is that success and likeability\nare positively correlated for men\n\n00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.773\nand negatively correlated for women.\n\n00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.813\nAnd everyone's nodding,\nbecause we all know this to be true.\n\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.934\nThere's a really good study\nthat shows this really well.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.149\nThere's a famous Harvard\nBusiness School study\n\n00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.806\non a woman named Heidi Roizen.\n\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.234\nAnd she's an operator\nin a company in Silicon Valley,\n\n00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:52.934\nand she uses her contacts\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.494\nto become a very successful\nventure capitalist.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.934\nIn 2002 -- not so long ago --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.197\na professor who was then\nat Columbia University\n\n00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.604\ntook that case\nand made it [Howard] Roizen.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.461\nAnd he gave the case out, both of them,\nto two groups of students.\n\n00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:09.417\nHe changed exactly one word:\n\n00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.934\n\"Heidi\" to \"Howard.\"\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.934\nBut that one word made\na really big difference.\n\n00:08:14.505 --> 00:08:16.136\nHe then surveyed the students,\n\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.826\nand the good news was the students,\nboth men and women,\n\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.244\nthought Heidi and Howard\nwere equally competent,\n\n00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:22.546\nand that's good.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.641\nThe bad news was\nthat everyone liked Howard.\n\n00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:27.665\nHe's a great guy.\nYou want to work for him.\n\n00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:29.689\nYou want to spend the day\nfishing with him.\n\n00:08:29.713 --> 00:08:31.275\nBut Heidi? Not so sure.\n\n00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:34.164\nShe's a little out for herself.\nShe's a little political.\n\n00:08:34.188 --> 00:08:36.235\nYou're not sure\nyou'd want to work for her.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.583\nThis is the complication.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.268\nWe have to tell our daughters\nand our colleagues,\n\n00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.976\nwe have to tell ourselves\nto believe we got the A,\n\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.934\nto reach for the promotion,\nto sit at the table,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.737\nand we have to do it in a world\n\n00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.356\nwhere, for them, there are sacrifices\nthey will make for that,\n\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.667\neven though for their brothers,\nthere are not.\n\n00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:59.442\nThe saddest thing about all of this\nis that it's really hard to remember this.\n\n00:08:59.466 --> 00:09:02.514\nAnd I'm about to tell a story\nwhich is truly embarrassing for me,\n\n00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:03.845\nbut I think important.\n\n00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:07.425\nI gave this talk at Facebook\nnot so long ago\n\n00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.938\nto about 100 employees,\n\n00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:13.010\nand a couple hours later,\nthere was a young woman who works there\n\n00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:16.373\nsitting outside my little desk,\nand she wanted to talk to me.\n\n00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:18.540\nI said, okay, and she sat down,\nand we talked.\n\n00:09:18.564 --> 00:09:20.517\nAnd she said, \"I learned something today.\n\n00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:22.596\nI learned that I need to keep my hand up.\"\n\n00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:23.969\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:25.787\nShe said, \"You're giving this talk,\n\n00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:28.108\nand you said you would take\ntwo more questions.\n\n00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:30.212\nI had my hand up with many other people,\n\n00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.831\nand you took two more questions.\n\n00:09:31.855 --> 00:09:34.765\nI put my hand down, and I noticed\nall the women did the same,\n\n00:09:34.789 --> 00:09:36.718\nand then you took more questions,\n\n00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.934\nonly from the men.\"\n\n00:09:39.114 --> 00:09:40.405\nAnd I thought to myself,\n\n00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:43.234\n\"Wow, if it's me -- who cares\nabout this, obviously --\n\n00:09:43.258 --> 00:09:45.192\ngiving this talk --\n\n00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:50.934\nand during this talk, I can't even notice\nthat the men's hands are still raised,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.934\nand the women's hands are still raised,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.136\nhow good are we\n\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.864\nas managers of our companies\nand our organizations\n\n00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.413\nat seeing that the

partner.\n\n00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:14.355\nI've become convinced that we've made\nmore progress in the workforce\n\n00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.934\nthan we have in the home.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.169\nThe data shows this very clearly.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.137\nIf a woman and a man\nwork full-time and have a child,\n\n00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.514\nthe woman does twice the amount\nof housework the man does,\n\n00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:30.934\nand the woman does three times\nthe amount of childcare the man does.\n\n00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:35.155\nSo she's got three jobs\nor two jobs, and he's got one.\n\n00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.206\nWho do you think drops out\nwhen someone needs to be home more?\n\n00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:42.582\nThe causes of this are really complicated,\nand I don't have time to go into them.\n\n00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:46.542\nAnd I don't think Sunday football-watching\nand general laziness is the cause.\n\n00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:48.780\nI think the cause is more complicated.\n\n00:10:48.804 --> 00:10:50.293\nI think, as a society,\n\n00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:52.534\nwe put more pressure\non our boys to succeed\n\n00:10:52.558 --> 00:10:53.934\nthan we do on our girls.\n\n00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:56.440\nI know men that stay home\n\n00:10:56.464 --> 00:10:59.531\nand work in the home\nto support wives with careers,\n\n00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:00.582\nand it's hard.\n\n00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:03.934\nWhen I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff\nand I see the father there,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.477\nI notice that the other mommies\ndon't play with him.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.934\nAnd that's a problem,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.144\nbecause we have to make it\nas important a job,\n\n00:11:13.168 --> 00:11:16.547\nbecause it's the hardest job\nin the world to work inside the home,\n\n00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:18.051\nfor people of both genders,\n\n00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:21.569\nif we're going to even things out and let\nwomen stay in the workforce.\n\n00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:22.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.197\nStudies show that households\nwith equal earning\n\n00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:27.163\nand equal responsibility\n\n00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.348\nalso have half the divorce rate.\n\n00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:32.556\nAnd if that wasn't good enough motivation\nfor everyone out there,\n\n00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.393\nthey also have more --\n\n00:11:34.417 --> 00:11:36.227\nhow shall I say this on this stage?\n\n00:11:36.251 -->

00:11:44.934\nDon't leave before you leave.\n\n00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.240\nI think there's a really deep irony\n\n00:11:47.264 --> 00:11:49.349\nto the fact that actions\nwomen are taking --\n\n00:11:49.373 --> 00:11:50.934\nand I see this all the time --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.084\nwith the objective\nof staying in the workforce\n\n00:11:54.108 --> 00:11:56.673\nactually lead to

The first one is happening right here in Chicago. Brenda Palms-Farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison. Currently, taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail. We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back. I find it interesting that, for every one dollar we spend, however, on early childhood education, like Head Start, we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future. Or \u2014 think about it \u2014 that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well.But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey. Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me. It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential. She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees, harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves, and that were later sold at Whole Foods. She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed, like anger-management and teamwork, and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more. Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail. So these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process. Talk about a sweet beginning.Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles, and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues. But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now. They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains. Currently, 20 percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California. Their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island \u2014 linking trees, people and technology to create a more livable city. All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water, also helps cool our cities. Because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want? How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.So a few years ago, L.A. County decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools. And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves. And by presenting a really strong economic case, they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery, that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure. So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided, and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down, while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up, resulting in a net-savings to the system, but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia. And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be Judy. But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. Now, two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months, and only for about a few years' worth of coal. That kind of technology is called \"mountaintop removal.\" It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. Just imagine that the air surrounding these places \u2014 it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so \u2014 not just miners, but everybody.And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned. And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake. But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain, and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet. Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs, or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills, and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind. She calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time, and it's a net-plus on so many levels for the local, national and global economy. It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal, but the wind energy actually pays back forever. Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals, and it gives them a lot of misery. The water is turned into goo. Most people are still unemployed, leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience \u2014 drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.Now Judy and I \u2014 I have to say \u2014 totally related to each other. Not quite an obvious alliance. I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia. I mean, they are not \u2014 they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, \"Save the endangered hillbillies.\" So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. But just a few months ago, Judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer. Yeah. And it has since moved to her bones and her brain. And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy. And she might not get to see that mountaintop. But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something, she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen. That's what my homegirl is doing. So I'm so proud of that.(Applause)But these three people don't know each other, but they do have an awful lot in common. They're all problem solvers, and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org. Now they're all very practical visionaries. They take a look at the demands that are out there \u2014 beauty products, healthy schools, electricity \u2014 and how the money's flowing to meet those demands. And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs, you're left with unemployed people, and those people aren't cheap. In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens, and they include generationally impoverished, traumatized vets returning from the Middle East, people coming out of jail. And for the veterans in particular, the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003. I think that number's probably going to go up. They're not the largest number of people, but they are some of the most expensive \u2014 and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands, reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future.And there are plenty of other examples like that. One problem: waste handling and unemployment. Even when we think or talk about recycling, lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates \u2014 they leave much to be recycled. And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities. And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models \u2014 there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing. And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx, but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot. Fortunately \u2014 because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs \u2014 but after many years, the city wanted to build a jail. They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment. Working-class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system. It relies too much on transportation, chemical fertilization, big use of water and also refrigeration. Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land, and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity. And so we know \"urban ag\" is a big buzz topic this time of the year, but it's mostly gardening, which has some value in community building \u2014 lots of it \u2014 but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production. The numbers just aren't there. Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city, that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities, owned and operated by small growers, where now there are only consumers. This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce. It's not a competition with rural farm; it's actually reinforcements. It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system.The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well. This is smart infrastructure. And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure \u2014 things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs. And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base. And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability. So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.These examples indicate a trend. I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident. I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country, and the good news is that it's growing. And we all need to be invested in it. It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery. And I call it \"hometown security.\" The recession has us reeling and fearful, and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering. It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery. Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local. And when we do that, our neighbors \u2014 be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country \u2014 will be just fine. The sum of the local is the global. Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses, putting people to work, restoring our natural systems. Hometown security means creating wealth here at home, instead of destroying it overseas. Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings, wealth generation and national security. Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America. The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more.Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own, but it's not like the old saying, \"charity begins at home.\" I recently read a book called \"Love Leadership\" by John Hope Bryant. And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear. And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. See, my dad was a great, great man in many ways. He grew up in the segregated South, escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times, and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times. But, like all of us, he had some problems. (Laughter) And his was gambling, compulsively. To him that phrase, \"Charity begins at home,\" meant that my payday \u2014 or someone else's \u2014 would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. So you need to help him out. And sometimes I would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs, and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest, of course, after he hit it big. And he did sometimes, believe it or not, at a racetrack in Los Angeles \u2014 one reason to love L.A. \u2014 back in the 1940s. He made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in. So I'm not that unhappy about that. But listen, I did feel obligated to him, and I grew up \u2014 then I grew up. And I'm a grown woman now, and I have learned a few things along the way.To me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts. I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year \u2014 I'm not trying to feed the habit. I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment, that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it, actually left people in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before. And over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions \u2014 in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty \u2014 but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.And I know a little bit about these issues, because, for many years, I spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex, and I'm a recovering executive director, two years clean. (Laughter) But during that time, I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities. But I really did struggle for financial support. The greater our success, the less money came in from foundations. And I tell you, being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived. And by the time I'd moved on, I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees. And I think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. But since then, the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk became this little thing. But I did in fact get married in it. Over here. There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding. The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006. Since then, we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. And we love this, because I love construction now, because we're watching these things actually happen.So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people. Hometown security is next on my to-do list. What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises, who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. We need to work together to embrace and repair our land, repair our power systems and repair ourselves. It's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1041, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo today, I'm going to tell you about some people\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nwho didn't move out of their neighborhoods.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThe first one is happening right here in Chicago.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nBrenda Palms-Farber was hired\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nto help ex-convicts reenter society\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nand keep them from going back into prison.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nCurrently, taxpayers spend\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nabout 60,000 dollars per year\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nsending a person to jail.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nWe know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI find it interesting that, for every one dollar\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nwe spend, however, on early childhood education,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nlike Head Start,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nwe save 17 dollars\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\non stuff like incarceration in the future.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nOr -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nis more than what it costs\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nto send one person to Harvard as well.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nBut Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\ntook a look at her challenge\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand came up\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nwith a not-so-obvious solution:\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\ncreate a business\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat produces skin care products from honey.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nOkay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt's the basis of growing a form of social innovation\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthat has real potential.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nShe hired seemingly unemployable men and women\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nto care for the bees, harvest the honey\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand make value-added products\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat they marketed themselves,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand that were later sold at Whole Foods.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nShe combined employment experience and training\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwith life skills they needed,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nlike anger-management and teamwork,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand also how to talk to future employers\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nabout how their experiences\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nactually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand their eagerness to learn more.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nLess than four percent\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nof the folks that went through her program\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nactually go back to jail.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nSo these young men and women learned job-readiness\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand life skills through bee keeping\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand became productive citizens in the process.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nTalk about a sweet beginning.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nNow, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand lots of people know\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthat L.A. has its issues.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nBut I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nThey have not enough water on most days\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand too much to handle when it rains.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nCurrently, 20 percent\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nof California's energy consumption\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nis used to pump water\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\ninto mostly Southern California.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nTheir spending loads, loads,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nto channel that rainwater out into the ocean\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhen it rains and floods as well.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNow Andy Lipkis is working to help\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nL.A. cut infrastructure costs\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nassociated with water management and urban heat island --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nlinking trees, people and technology\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nto create a more livable city.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAll that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nalso helps cool our cities.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nBecause, come to think about it,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ndo you really want air-conditioning,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nor is it a cooler room that you want?\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nHow you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSo a few years ago,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nL.A. County\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\ndecided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nto repair the city schools.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd Andy and his team discovered\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nthat they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\non asphalt to surround the schools themselves.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd by presenting a really strong economic case,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthey convinced the L.A. government\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat replacing that asphalt\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwith trees and other greenery,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthat the schools themselves would save the system more on energy\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthan they spend on horticultural infrastructure.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwas replaced or avoided,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwhile employment\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nfor people to maintain those grounds went up,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nresulting in a net-savings to the system,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbut also healthier students and schools system employees as well.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nNow Judy Bonds\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis a coal miner's daughter.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nHer family has eight generations\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nin a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd if anyone should be clinging\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nto the former glory of the coal mining history,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand of the town,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nit should be Judy.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBut the way coal is mined right now is different\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nfrom the deep mines that her father\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand her father's father would go down into\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nNow, two dozen men\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\ncan tear down a mountain in several months,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand only for about a few years' worth of coal.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThat kind of technology is called \"mountaintop removal.\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIt can make a mountain go from this to this\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nin a few short months.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nJust imagine that the air surrounding these places --\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nWhen we visited, it gave some of the people we were with\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthis strange little cough\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nafter being only there for just a few hours or so --\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nnot just miners, but everybody.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd Judy saw her landscape being destroyed\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand her water poisoned.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd the coal companies just move on\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nafter the mountain was emptied,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nleaving even more unemployment in their wake.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nBut she also saw the difference in potential wind energy\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\non an intact mountain,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand one that was reduced in elevation\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nby over 2,000 feet.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThree years of dirty energy with not many jobs,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nor centuries of clean energy\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwith the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbased on technical skills,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand developing local knowledge\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nabout how to get the most out of that region's wind.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nShe calculated the up-front cost\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand the payback over time,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand it's a net-plus on so many levels\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nfor the local, national and global economy.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nIt's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbut the wind energy actually pays back forever.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nNow mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand it gives them a lot of misery.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThe water is turned into goo.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nMost people are still unemployed,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nleading to most of the same kinds of social problems\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat unemployed people in inner cities also experience --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\ndrug and alcohol abuse,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\ndomestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nNow Judy and I -- I have to say --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\ntotally related to each other.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNot quite an obvious alliance.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nI mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI mean, they are not --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthey ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nor anything like that.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nsays, \"Save the endangered hillbillies.\"\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo homegirls and hillbillies we got it together\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand totally understand that this is what it's all about.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nBut just a few months ago,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nJudy was diagnosed\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwith stage-three lung cancer.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nYeah.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd it has since moved to her bones and her brain.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd I just find it so bizarre\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat she's suffering from the same thing\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthat she tried so hard to protect people from.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBut her dream\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nof Coal River Mountain Wind\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nis her legacy.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd she might not\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nget to see that mountaintop.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBut rather than writing\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nyet some kind of manifesto or something,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nshe's leaving behind\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\na business plan to make it happen.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThat's what my homegirl is doing.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo I'm so proud of that.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut these three people\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\ndon't know each other,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nbut they do have an awful lot in common.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThey're all problem solvers,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand they're just some of the many examples\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin the examples of the work that I do now.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nI was really lucky to have them all featured\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\non my Corporation for Public Radio radio show\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\ncalled ThePromisedLand.org.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow they're all very practical visionaries.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThey take a look at the demands that are out there --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nbeauty products, healthy schools, electricity --\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand how the money's flowing to meet those demands.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd when the cheapest solutions\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\ninvolve reducing the number of jobs,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nyou're left with unemployed people,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand those people aren't cheap.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIn fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand they include generationally impoverished,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ntraumatized vets returning from the Middle East,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\npeople coming out of jail.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd for the veterans in particular,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthe V.A. said there's a six-fold increase\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nin mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nI think that number's probably going to go up.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nThey're not the largest number of people,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nbut they are some of the most expensive --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\npoor performance by their kids in schools\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand also poor health as a result of stress.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo these three guys all understand\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nhow to productively channel dollars\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthrough our local economies\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nto meet existing market demands,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nreduce the social problems that we have now\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand prevent new problems in the future.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd there are plenty of other examples like that.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nOne problem: waste handling and unemployment.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nEven when we think or talk about recycling,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nlots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthey leave much to be recycled.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthere's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwhere either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nor you use recycled materials\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nto make goods that you can actually use and sell.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nWe can create these local markets and incentives\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nfor recycled materials\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nto be used as raw materials for manufacturing.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nbut our mayor decided what he wanted to see\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwas a jail on that same spot.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nFortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nbut after many years,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthe city wanted to build a jail.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThey've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnother problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nWorking-class and poor urban Americans\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nare not benefiting economically\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nfrom our current food system.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nIt relies too much on transportation,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nchemical fertilization, big use of water\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand also refrigeration.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nMega agricultural operations\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\noften are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand it produces this incredibly unhealthy product\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthat costs us billions in healthcare\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand lost productivity.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd so we know \"urban ag\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nis a big buzz topic this time of the year,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nbut it's mostly gardening,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nwhich has some value in community building -- lots of it --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut it's not in terms of creating jobs\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nor for food production.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThe numbers just aren't there.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nPart of my work now is really laying the groundwork\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nto integrate urban ag and rural food systems\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nto hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nby creating a national brand of urban-grown produce\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nin every city,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthat uses regional growing power\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nand augments it with indoor growing facilities,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nowned and operated by small growers,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nwhere now there are only consumers.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThis can support seasonal farmers around metro areas\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwho are losing out because they really can't meet\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nthe year-round demand for produce.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nIt's not a competition with rural farm;\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nit's actually reinforcements.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nIt allies in a really positive\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand economically viable food system.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThe goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nfor hospitals,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nsenior centers, schools, daycare centers,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand produce a network of regional jobs, as well.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThis is smart infrastructure.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd how we manage our built environment\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\naffects the health and well-being of people every single day.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOur municipalities, rural and urban,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nplay the operational course of infrastructure --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthings like waste disposal, energy demand,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nas well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand the impacts of various public health costs.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nSmart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nfor municipalities to handle\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nboth infrastructure and social needs.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd we want to shift the systems\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthat open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nto become part of the tax base.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd imagine a national business model\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthat creates local jobs and smart infrastructure\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nto improve local economic stability.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nSo I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThese examples indicate a trend.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nI haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nI'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand the good news is that it's growing.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd we all need to be invested in it.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nIt is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nAnd I call it \"hometown security.\"\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThe recession has us reeling and fearful,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand there's something in the air these days\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat is also very empowering.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's a realization\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nthat we are the key\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nto our own recovery.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nNow is the time for us to act in our own communities\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwhere we think local and we act local.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nAnd when we do that, our neighbors --\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nbe they next-door, or in the next state,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nor in the next country --\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nwill be just fine.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe sum of the local is the global.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nHometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nputting people to work,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nrestoring our natural systems.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nHometown security means creating wealth here at home,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\ninstead of destroying it overseas.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nTackling social and environmental problems\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nat the same time with the same solution\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nyields great cost savings,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nwealth generation and national security.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nMany great and inspiring solutions\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhave been generated across America.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nThe challenge for us now\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nis to identify and support countless more.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nNow, hometown security is about taking care of your own,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbut it's not like the old saying,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\n\"charity begins at home.\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nI recently read a book called \"Love Leadership\" by John Hope Bryant.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd it's about leading in a world\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthat really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd reading that book made me reexamine that theory\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nbecause I need to explain what I mean by that.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nSee, my dad\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwas a great, great man in many ways.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nHe grew up in the segregated South,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nescaped lynching and all that\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nduring some really hard times,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut, like all of us, he had some problems.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd his was gambling,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\ncompulsively.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nTo him that phrase, \"Charity begins at home,\"\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nmeant that my payday -- or someone else's --\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwould just happen to coincide with his lucky day.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nSo you need to help him out.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd sometimes I would loan him money\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nfrom my after-school or summer jobs,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand he always had the great intention\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nof paying me back with interest,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nof course, after he hit it big.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd he did sometimes, believe it or not,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nat a racetrack in Los Angeles --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\none reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nHe made 15,000 dollars cash\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nand bought the house that I grew up in.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSo I'm not that unhappy about that.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut listen, I did feel obligated to him,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand I grew up -- then I grew up.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd I'm a grown woman now,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand I have learned a few things along the way.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nTo me, charity\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\noften is just about giving,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nbecause you're supposed to,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nor because it's what you've always done,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nor it's about giving until it hurts.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nI'm about providing the means\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nto build something that will grow\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand intensify its original investment\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand not just require greater giving next year --\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI'm not trying to feed the habit.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nI spent some years\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwatching how good intentions for community empowerment,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthat were supposed to be there\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nto support the community and empower it,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nactually left people\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd over the past 20 years,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nwe've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\non social problems,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nyet educational outcomes,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nmalnutrition, incarceration,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nobesity, diabetes, income disparity,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthey've all gone up with some exceptions --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin particular, infant mortality\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\namong people in poverty --\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nbut it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd I know a little bit about these issues,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nbecause, for many years, I spent a long time\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nin the non-profit industrial complex,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nand I'm a recovering executive director,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\ntwo years clean.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nBut during that time, I realized that it was about projects\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand developing them on the local level\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nthat really was going to do the right thing for our communities.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nBut I really did struggle for financial support.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nThe greater our success,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nthe less money came in from foundations.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd I tell you, being on the TED stage\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand winning a MacArthur in the same exact year\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ngave everyone the impression that I had arrived.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnd by the time I'd moved on,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI was actually covering a third\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nof my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nAnd I think because early on, frankly,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nmy programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nBut since then,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nthe park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nbecame this little thing.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nBut I did in fact get married in it.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nOver here.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nThere goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThe South Bronx Greenway\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwas also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nSince then, we got\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nabout 50 million dollars in stimulus package money\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nto come and get here.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nAnd we love this, because I love construction now,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nbecause we're watching these things actually happen.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nSo I want everyone to understand\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nthe critical importance\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nof shifting charity into enterprise.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nI started my firm to help communities across the country\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nrealize their own potential\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nto improve everything about the quality of life for their people.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nHometown security\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nis next on my to-do list.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nWhat we need are people who see the value\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nin investing in these types of local enterprises,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nwho will partner with folks like me\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nto identify the growth trends and climate adaptation\n\n00:17:18.958

"https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability", "transcript": "So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called, and she said, \"I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.\" And I thought, \"Well, what's the struggle?\" And she said, \"Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant.\"(Laughter)And I was like, \"Okay.\" And she said, \"But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller.\" And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, \"You're going to call me a what?\" And she said, \"I'm going to call you a storyteller.\" And I was like, \"Why not 'magic pixie'?\"(Laughter)I was like, \"Let me think about this for a second.\" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said, \"You know what? Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller.\" And she went, \"Ha ha. There's no such thing.\"(Laughter)So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today \u2014 we're talking about expanding perception \u2014 and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, \"Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist.\" And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. I was like, \"Really?\" and he was like, \"Absolutely.\" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the \"life's messy, love it.\" And I'm more of the, \"life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box.\"(Laughter)And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me \u2014 really, one of the big sayings in social work is, \"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\" And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see.So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is \u2014 neurobiologically that's how we're wired \u2014 it's why we're here.So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one \"opportunity for growth?\"(Laughter)And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection.So very quickly \u2014 really about six weeks into this research \u2014 I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection?The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this \"I'm not good enough,\" \u2014 which, we all know that feeling: \"I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough.\" The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know, it's not going to turn out well.(Laughter)You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to \u2014 and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research.My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories \u2014 thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay \u2014 and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness \u2014 that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness \u2014 they have a strong sense of love and belonging \u2014 and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those.What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? And the first words that came to my mind were \"whole-hearted.\" These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. What's the theme? What's the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode.And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language \u2014 it's from the Latin word \"cor,\" meaning \"heart\" \u2014 and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection, and \u2014 this was the hard part \u2014 as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating \u2014 as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, \"I love you\" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental.I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job \u2014 you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 which actually looked more like this.(Laughter)And it did.I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.(Laughter)A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, \"I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?\" Because about five of my friends were like, \"Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist.\"(Laughter)I was like, \"What does that mean?\" And they're like, \"I'm just saying, you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.\"(Laughter)I was like, \"Okay.\" So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana \u2014 I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, \"How are you?\" And I said, \"I'm great. I'm okay.\" She said, \"What's going on?\" And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.(Laughter)And so I said, \"Here's the thing, I'm struggling.\" And she said, \"What's the struggle?\" And I said, \"Well, I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem, and I need some help.\" And I said, \"But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit.\"(Laughter)\"I just need some strategies.\"(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you. So she goes like this.(Laughter)And then I said, \"It's bad, right?\" And she said, \"It's neither good nor bad.\"(Laughter)\"It just is what it is.\" And I said, \"Oh my God, this is going to suck.\"(Laughter)And it did, and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that.(Laughter)For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back.And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No.So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability \u2014 when we're waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, \"How would you define vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?\" And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.And I think there's evidence \u2014 and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause \u2014 We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is \u2014 and I learned this from the research \u2014 that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.(Laughter)I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God.(Laughter)You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle.One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. \"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up.\" That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.(Laughter)Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, \"Wow.\"(Laughter)And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, \"Look at her, she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect \u2014 make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.\" That's not our job. Our job is to look and say, \"You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.\" That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate \u2014 whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... \"We're sorry. We'll fix it.\"But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee \u2014 and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult \u2014 to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, \"Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?\" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, \"I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.\" And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, \"I'm enough\" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.That's all I have. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1042, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:17.019\nSo, I'll start with this: a couple\nyears ago, an event

parent.\n\n00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.923\nAnd this is where my story starts.\n\n00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:52.371\nWhen I was a young researcher,\ndoctoral student,\n\n00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:56.372\nmy first year, I had\na research professor who said to us,\n\n00:01:56.396 --> 00:02:00.342\n\"Here's the thing, if you cannot\nmeasure it, it does not exist.\"\n\n00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:04.664\nAnd I thought he was just\nsweet-talking me.\n\n00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.474\nI was like, \"Really?\"\nand he was like, \"Absolutely.\"\n\n00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:09.751\nAnd so you have to understand\n\n00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.355\nthat I have a bachelor's\nand a master's in social work,\n\n00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.753\nand I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,\nso my entire academic career\n\n00:02:15.777 --> 00:02:21.394\nwas surrounded by people who kind of\nbelieved in the \"life's messy, love it.\"\n\n00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:27.600\nAnd I'm more of the, \"life's messy,\nclean it up, organize it\n\n00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:29.401\nand put it into a bento box.\"\n\n00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.401\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:37.029\nAnd so to think that I had found my way,\nto found a career that takes me --\n\n00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:40.386\nreally, one of the big sayings\nin social work is,\n\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.505\n\"Lean into the discomfort of the work.\"\n\n00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:45.767\nAnd I'm like, knock discomfort\nupside the head\n\n00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.069\nand move it over and get all A's.\n\n00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:50.005\nThat was my mantra.\n\n00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:53.664\nSo I was very excited about this.\n\n00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:56.664\nAnd so I thought, you know what,\nthis is the career for me,\n\n00:02:56.688 --> 00:02:59.664\nbecause I am interested\nin some messy topics.\n\n00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.059\nBut I want to be able\nto make them not messy.\n\n00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:03.405\nI want to understand them.\n\n00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.006\nI want to hack into these things\nthat I know are important\n\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.006\nand lay the code out for everyone to see.\n\n00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.347\nSo where I started was with connection.\n\n00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.783\nBecause, by the time\nyou're a social worker for 10 years,\n\n00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:20.514\nwhat you realize is that connection\nis why we're here.\n\n00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:22.918\nIt's what gives purpose\nand meaning to our lives.\n\n00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:25.560\nThis is what it's all about.\n\n00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:27.681\nIt doesn't matter whether\nyou talk to people\n\n00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:30.797\nwho work in social justice,\nmental health and abuse and neglect,\n\n00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:36.162\nwhat we know is that connection,\nthe ability to feel connected, is --\n\n00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:38.664\nneurobiologically\nthat's how we're wired --\n\n00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:40.067\nit's why we're here.\n\n00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.104\nSo I thought, you know what,\nI'm going to start with connection.\n\n00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.662\nWell, you know that situation\n\n00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:48.194\nwhere you get an evaluation\nfrom your boss,\n\n00:03:48.218 --> 00:03:51.004\nand she tells you 37 things\nthat you do really awesome,\n\n00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:53.402\nand one \"opportunity for growth?\"\n\n00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:55.235\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:59.362\nAnd all you can think about\nis that opportunity for growth, right?\n\n00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.084\nWell, apparently this is the way\nmy work went as well,\n\n00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:07.085\nbecause, when you ask people about love,\nthey tell you about heartbreak.\n\n00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.743\nWhen you ask people about belonging,\n\n00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:13.719\nthey'll tell you their most excruciating\nexperiences of being excluded.\n\n00:04:13.743 --> 00:04:16.244\nAnd when you ask people about connection,\n\n00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:18.806\nthe stories they told me\nwere about disconnection.\n\n00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:22.841\nSo very quickly -- really about six weeks\ninto this research --\n\n00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:28.887\nI ran into this unnamed thing\nthat absolutely unraveled connection\n\n00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:31.371\nin a way that I didn't understand\nor had never seen.\n\n00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:33.784\nAnd so I pulled back out of the research\n\n00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:36.038\nand thought, I need\nto figure out what this is.\n\n00:04:36.062 --> 00:04:38.241\nAnd it turned out to be shame.\n\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.188\nAnd shame is really easily understood\nas the fear of disconnection:\n\n00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:48.467\nIs there something about me that,\nif other people know it or see it,\n\n00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.657\nthat I won't be worthy of connection?\n\n00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.973\nThe things I can tell you about it:\n\n00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.664\nIt's universal; we all have it.\n\n00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:57.688\nThe only people who don't experience shame\n\n00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:00.046\nhave no capacity for human\nempathy or connection.\n\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.664\nNo one wants to talk about it,\n\n00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:04.259\nand the less you talk about it,\nthe more you have it.\n\n00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:10.869\nWhat underpinned this shame,\nthis \"I'm not good enough,\" --\n\n00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.497\nwhich, we all know that feeling:\n\n00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.570\n\"I'm not blank enough.\nI'm not thin enough,\n\n00:05:14.594 --> 00:05:17.848\nrich enough, beautiful enough,\nsmart enough, promoted enough.\"\n\n00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:22.848\nThe thing that underpinned this\nwas excruciating vulnerability.\n\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.664\nThis idea of, in order\nfor connection to happen,\n\n00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:31.434\nwe have to allow ourselves\nto be seen, really seen.\n\n00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.957\nAnd you know how I feel\nabout vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.\n\n00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:40.479\nAnd so I thought, this is my chance\nto beat it back with my measuring stick.\n\n00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:43.194\nI'm going in, I'm going\nto figure this stuff out,\n\n00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.528\nI'm going to spend a year,\nI'm going to totally deconstruct shame,\n\n00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.830\nI'm going to understand\nhow vulnerability works,\n\n00:05:48.854 --> 00:05:50.289\nand I'm going to outsmart it.\n\n00:05:51.338 --> 00:05:53.608\nSo I was ready, and I was really excited.\n\n00:05:56.937 --> 00:05:59.080\nAs you know,\nit's not going to turn out well.\n\n00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:01.617\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.235\nYou know this.\n\n00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.148\nSo, I could tell you a lot about shame,\n\n00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:07.269\nbut I'd have to borrow\neveryone else's time.\n\n00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:10.150\nBut here's what I can tell you\nthat it boils down to --\n\n00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:13.556\nand this may be one of the most important\nthings that I've ever learned\n\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.444\nin the decade of doing this research.\n\n00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:20.958\nMy one year turned into six years:\n\n00:06:20.982 --> 00:06:25.664\nThousands of stories, hundreds\nof long interviews, focus groups.\n\n00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:28.069\nAt one point, people were\nsending me journal pages\n\n00:06:28.093 --> 00:06:29.930\nand sending me their stories --\n\n00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:33.946\nthousands of pieces of data in six years.\n\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.664\nAnd I kind of got a handle on it.\n\n00:06:35.688 --> 00:06:38.787\nI kind of understood, this is\nwhat shame is, this is how it works.\n\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.397\nI wrote a book, I published a theory,\nbut something was not okay --\n\n00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:50.577\nand what it was is that, if I roughly\ntook the people I interviewed\n\n00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:57.173\nand divided them into people who really\nhave a sense of worthiness --\n\n00:06:57.197 --> 00:06:59.959\nthat's what this comes down to,\na sense of worthiness --\n\n00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:03.205\nthey have a strong sense\nof love and belonging --\n\n00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.880\nand folks who struggle for it,\n\n00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:08.004\nand folks who are always wondering\nif they're good enough.\n\n00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:10.267\nThere was only one variable that separated\n\n00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.031\nthe people who have a strong sense\nof love and belonging\n\n00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:15.314\nand the people who really struggle for it.\n\n00:07:15.338 --> 00:07:19.056\nAnd that was, the people who have\na strong sense of love and belonging\n\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.484\nbelieve they're worthy\nof love and belonging.\n\n00:07:22.402 --> 00:07:23.552\nThat's it.\n\n00:07:24.203 --> 00:07:25.691\nThey believe they're worthy.\n\n00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:33.252\nAnd to me, the hard part of the one thing\nthat keeps us out of connection\n\n00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:36.491\nis our fear that we're not\nworthy of connection,\n\n00:07:36.515 --> 00:07:38.918\nwas something that,\npersonally and professionally,\n\n00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:41.164\nI felt like I needed to understand better.\n\n00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:46.482\nSo what I did is I took\nall of the interviews\n\n00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:49.324\nwhere I saw worthiness,\nwhere I saw people living that way,\n\n00:07:49.348 --> 00:07:51.236\nand just looked at those.\n\n00:07:52.012 --> 00:07:54.060\nWhat do these people have in common?\n\n00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:58.727\nI have a slight office supply addiction,\nbut that's another talk.\n\n00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:02.228\nSo I had a manila folder,\nand I had a Sharpie,\n\n00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:04.872\nand I was like, what am I going\nto call this research?\n\n00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:07.886\nAnd the first words that came\nto my mind were \"whole-hearted.\"\n\n00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:12.021\nThese are whole-hearted people,\nliving from this deep sense of worthiness.\n\n00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:14.901\nSo I wrote at the top\nof the manila folder,\n\n00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:16.854\nand I started looking at the data.\n\n00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:22.871\nIn fact, I did it first in a four-day,\nvery intensive data analysis,\n\n00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:26.472\nwhere I went back, pulled the interviews,\nthe stories, pulled the incidents.\n\n00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:28.275\nWhat's the theme? What's the pattern?\n\n00:08:29.068 --> 00:08:32.045\nMy husband left town with the kids\n\n00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:35.046\nbecause I always go into this\nJackson Pollock crazy thing,\n\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.815\nwhere I'm just writing\nand in my researcher mode.\n\n00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:41.870\nAnd so here's what I found.\n\n00:08:44.812 --> 00:08:47.664\nWhat they had in common\nwas a sense of courage.\n\n00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:51.419\nAnd I want to separate courage\nand bravery for you for a minute.\n\n00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:53.884\nCourage, the original\ndefinition of courage,\n\n00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.147\nwhen it first came\ninto the English language --\n\n00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:58.524\nit's from the Latin word \"cor,\"\nmeaning \"heart\" --\n\n00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:01.559\nand the original definition was to tell\nthe story of who you are\n\n00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.997\nwith your whole heart.\n\n00:09:03.757 --> 00:09:07.931\nAnd so these folks had, very simply,\nthe courage to be imperfect.\n\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.307\nThey had the compassion to be kind\nto themselves first and then to others,\n\n00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:16.530\nbecause, as it turns out,\n\n00:09:16.554 --> 00:09:18.788\nwe can't practice compassion\nwith other people\n\n00:09:18.812 --> 00:09:20.555\nif we can't treat ourselves kindly.\n\n00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:25.354\nAnd the last was they had connection,\nand -- this was the hard part --\n\n00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:28.355\nas a result of authenticity,\n\n00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:31.664\nthey were willing to let go\nof who they thought they should be\n\n00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:36.292\nin order to be who they were,\nwhich you have to absolutely do that\n\n00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:37.489\nfor connection.\n\n00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:44.021\nThe other thing that they had\nin common was this:\n\n00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:50.688\nThey fully embraced vulnerability.\n\n00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:59.028\nThey believed that what made them\nvulnerable made them beautiful.\n\n00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:06.664\nThey didn't talk about vulnerability\nbeing comfortable,\n\n00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:09.514\nnor did they really talk\nabout it being excruciating --\n\n00:10:09.538 --> 00:10:12.016\nas I had heard it earlier\nin the shame interviewing.\n\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.270\nThey just talked about it being necessary.\n\n00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:19.307\nThey talked about the willingness\nto say, \"I love you\" first ...\n\n00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:26.449\nthe willingness to do something\nwhere there are no guarantees ...\n\n00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:32.316\nthe willingness to breathe\nthrough waiting for the doctor to call\n\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.623\nafter your mammogram.\n\n00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:38.594\nThey're willing to invest\nin a relationship\n\n00:10:38.618 --> 00:10:40.068\nthat may or may not work out.\n\n00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:43.033\nThey thought this was fundamental.\n\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.759\nI personally thought it was betrayal.\n\n00:10:47.545 --> 00:10:52.141\nI could not believe I had pledged\nallegiance to research, where our job --\n\n00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:56.229\nyou know, the definition of research\nis to control and predict,\n\n00:10:56.253 --> 00:11:00.896\nto study phenomena for the explicit\nreason to control and predict.\n\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.286\nAnd now my mission to control and predict\n\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.879\nhad turned up the answer\nthat the way to live is with vulnerability\n\n00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:11.001\nand to stop controlling and predicting.\n\n00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:12.802\nThis led to a little breakdown --\n\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.664\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.688 --> 00:11:21.664\n-- which actually looked more like this.\n\n00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:23.181\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:25.182\nAnd it did.\n\n00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:28.386\nI call it a breakdown;

The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher. Ken and I have been working together for almost 40 years. That's Ken Sharpe over there.(Applause)So there is among many people \u2014 certainly me and most of the people I talk to \u2014 a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working, with the way our institutions run. Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them. Our doctors don't know who the hell we are, and they don't have enough time for us. We certainly can't trust the bankers, and we certainly can't trust the brokers. They almost brought the entire financial system down. And even as we do our own work, all too often, we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing, or the required thing, or the profitable thing. So everywhere we look, pretty much across the board, we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. Or if they do have our interests at heart, we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. They don't understand us. They don't have the time to get to know us.There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. If things aren't going right, the first response is: let's make more rules, let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing. Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom, so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids, as long as they follow the scripts, our kids will get educated. Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes, so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. Instead, all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime. Impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees. More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent, uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with.Or \u2014 or maybe and \u2014 in addition to rules, let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that, even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests, it is in their interest to serve our interest \u2014 the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. So we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems.Rules and incentives \u2014 \"sticks\" and \"carrots.\" We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. There's the Dodd-Frank Act, there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren. Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. We'll see. In addition, we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies, rather than securing short-term profits. So if we find just the right incentives, they'll do the right thing \u2014 as I said \u2014 selfishly, and if we come up with the right rules and regulations, they won't drive us all over a cliff. And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that.But what we believe, and what we argue in the book, is that there is no set of rules, no matter how detailed, no matter how specific, no matter how carefully monitored and enforced, there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. Why? Because bankers are smart people. And, like water, they will find cracks in any set of rules. You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system \"almost-collapse\" can't happen again. It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse, you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that.What we desperately need, beyond, or along with, better rules and reasonably smart incentives, is we need virtue. We need character. We need people who want to do the right thing. And in particular, the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called \"practical wisdom.\" Practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is. So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems \u2014 problems that they hadn't anticipated. So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos, and they need to measure out round columns. Well if you think about it, it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. So what do they do? They fashion a novel solution to the problem. They created a ruler that bends, what we would call these days a tape measure \u2014 a flexible rule, a rule that bends. And Aristotle said, \"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns, you need to bend the rule.\" And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people, we need to bend the rules.Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. Wise people know how to improvise. The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it, they are kind of like jazz musicians. The rules are like the notes on the page, and that gets you started, but then you dance around the notes on the page, coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. So for Aristotle, the kind of rule-bending, rule exception-finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. And in interactions with people, almost all the time, it is this kind of flexibility that is required. A wise person knows when to bend the rules. A wise person knows when to improvise. And most important, a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims. If you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself, what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. So it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself. And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding. Together they comprise practical wisdom, which Aristotle thought was the master virtue.So I'll give you an example of wise practice in action. It's the case of Michael. Michael's a young guy. He had a pretty low-wage job. He was supporting his wife and a child, and the child was going to parochial school. Then he lost his job. He panicked about being able to support his family. One night, he drank a little too much, and he robbed a cab driver \u2014 stole 50 dollars. He robbed him at gunpoint. It was a toy gun. He got caught. He got tried. He got convicted. The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years, 24 months. The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense. He had never committed a crime before. He was a responsible husband and father. He had been faced with desperate circumstances. All this would do is wreck a family. And so she improvised a sentence \u2014 11 months, and not only that, but release every day to go to work. Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job. He did. He served out his sentence. He made restitution and found himself a new job. And the family was united.And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life \u2014 a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. But it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own, and so he appealed. And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. He did after all have a toy gun. The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. He won the appeal. Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. Judge Forer had to follow the law. And by the way, this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence, so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. Judge Forer did what she was required to do, and then she quit the bench. And Michael disappeared. So that is an example, both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.Now consider Ms. Dewey. Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids, so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones, and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. So here was the consultant's advice: first, don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. Second, don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. Third, don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble, the so-called \"bubble kids\" \u2014 kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. So Ms. Dewey heard this, and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly. It's like they were about to go play a football game. For Ms. Dewey, this isn't why she became a teacher.Now Ken and I are not naive, and we understand that you need to have rules. You need to have incentives. People have to make a living. But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity, and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. First, they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. Judge Forer quits, and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. And second, they demoralize the activity itself. The very practice is demoralized, and the practitioners are demoralized. It creates people \u2014 when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing \u2014 it creates people who are addicted to incentives. That is to say, it creates people who only do things for incentives.Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for 30 years. Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years. We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures, they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. If you reward kids for reading books, they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are. If you reward teachers for kids' test scores, they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures \u2014 which is the current system \u2014 they would do more. If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures, they will do fewer. What we want, of course, is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason \u2014 namely, to serve the welfare of their patients. Psychologists have known this for decades, and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit, instead of economists.And it doesn't have to be this way. We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope. We identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws. These are people who, being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives, find away around the rules, find a way to subvert the rules. So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow, and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing. And so what they do is they follow the scripts, but they follow the scripts at double-time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes, and they're incredibly admirable, but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down.So canny outlaws are better than nothing, but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. More hopeful are people we call system-changers. These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations, but to transform the system, and we talk about several. One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet who had planned to make the army a career, but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq, and that forced him to take a medical discharge. He was married, he had a third kid on the way, he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back, and recurrent nightmares, and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. He was only able to get part-time work because of his back, and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. So he started selling marijuana. He was busted in a drug sweep. His family was kicked out of their apartment, and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids.Under normal sentencing procedures, Judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon. But Judge Russell did have an alternative. And that's because he was in a special court. He was in a court called the Veterans' Court. In the Veterans' Court \u2014 this was the first of its kind in the United States. Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging. No one wanted non-violent offenders \u2014 and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot \u2014 to be thrown into prison. They wanted to do something about what we all know, namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. And what the Veterans' Court did, was it treated each criminal as an individual, tried to get inside their problems, tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves, and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. Stayed with them, followed up on them, made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump.There are now 22 cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. Why has the idea spread? Well, one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen 108 vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year, and out of 108, guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. None. None. Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.There's a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged bankers \u2014 I know this is hard to believe \u2014 encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients. The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community. Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards, the default rate was extremely low. The bank was profitable. The bankers stayed with their loan recipients. They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. They serviced the loans. They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers. Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients, before it turned into an institution that serves only itself. Banking wasn't always this way, and it doesn't have to be this way.So there are examples like this in medicine \u2014 doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education, so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy, which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year. So the patients are not organ systems, and they're not diseases; they're people, people with lives. And in order to be an effective doctor, you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth, mentoring of one student by another, of all the students by the doctors, and the result is a generation \u2014 we hope \u2014 of doctors who do have time for the people they treat. We'll see.So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about. Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission \u2014 what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. People want to be allowed to be virtuous. They want to have permission to do the right thing. They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work.Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness, and he was right. There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy, and the two things that jump out in study after study \u2014 I know this will come as a shock to all of you \u2014 the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. Love: managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part. Work: engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying. If you have that, good close relations with other people, work that's meaningful and fulfilling, you don't much need anything else.Well, to love well and to work well, you need wisdom. Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent, how to be a good spouse, or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom. Indeed, we argue, there is no substitute for wisdom. And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self-sacrifice on the part of practitioners. In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing \u2014 to do right by others \u2014 practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves.Thanks.(Applause)", "id":

dissatisfaction\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nwith the way things are working,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwith the way our institutions run.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nOur kids' teachers seem to be failing them.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nOur doctors don't know who the hell we are,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand they don't have enough time for us.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nWe certainly can't trust the bankers,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand we certainly can't trust the brokers.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nThey almost brought the entire financial system down.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd even as we do our own work,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nall too often,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwe find ourselves having to choose\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nbetween doing what we think is the right thing\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand doing the expected thing,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nor the required thing,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nor the profitable thing.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nSo everywhere we look,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\npretty much across the board,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nwe worry that the people we depend on\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\ndon't really have our interests at heart.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nOr if they do have our interests at heart,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nwe worry that they don't know us well enough\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nto figure out what they need to do\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nin order to allow us\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nto secure those interests.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThey don't understand us.\n\n00:01:38.958

00:01:54.958\nlet's make more rules,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nlet's set up a set\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nof detailed procedures\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nto make sure that people will do the right thing.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nGive teachers scripts\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nto follow in the classroom,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nso even if they

00:02:28.958\nis look up on the list\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nwhat kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nImpose limits\n\n00:02:33.958 -->

bonuses\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nif the kids they teach\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nscore passing grades on these big test scores\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat are used to

\"carrots.\"\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nWe passed a bunch of rules\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto regulate the financial industry\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nin response to the recent collapse.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThere's the Dodd-Frank Act,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthere's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat is temporarily being headed through the backdoor\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nby Elizabeth Warren.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nMaybe these rules\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwill actually improve\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe way these financial services companies behave.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe'll see.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIn addition, we are struggling\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nto find some way to create incentives\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nfor people in the financial services industry\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthat will have them more interested\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nin serving the long-term interests\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\neven of their own companies,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nrather than securing short-term profits.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nSo if we find just the right incentives,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthey'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand if we come up with the right rules and regulations,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthey won't drive us all over a cliff.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat you need to reign in the bankers.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nit is that.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nBut what we believe,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand what we argue in the book,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nis that there is no set of rules,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nno matter how detailed,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nno matter how specific,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nno matter how carefully monitored\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand enforced,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthere is no set of rules\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat will get us what we need.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nWhy? Because bankers are smart people.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nAnd, like water,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nthey will find cracks\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nin any set of rules.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nYou design a set of rules that will make sure\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat the particular reason\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwhy the financial system \"almost-collapse\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\ncan't happen again.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt is naive beyond description\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nto think that having blocked\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthis source of financial collapse,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nyou have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo it's just a question of waiting for the next one\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand then marveling at how we could have been so stupid\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nas not to protect ourselves against that.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWhat we desperately need,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nbeyond, or along with, better rules\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nand reasonably smart incentives,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nis we need virtue.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe need character.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nWe need people who want to do the right thing.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd in particular,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthe virtue that we need most of all\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nis the virtue that Aristotle called\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\n\"practical wisdom.\"\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nPractical wisdom\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nis the moral will\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nto do the right thing\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand the moral skill\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nto figure out what the right thing is.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo Aristotle was very interested in watching\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nhow the craftsmen around him worked.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd he was impressed\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nat how they would improvise\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nnovel solutions to novel problems --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nproblems that they hadn't anticipated.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo one example is he sees these stonemasons\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nworking on the Isle of Lesbos,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand they need to measure out\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nround columns.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWell if you think about it,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nit's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo what do they do?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nThey fashion a novel solution to the problem.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThey created a ruler that bends,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhat we would call these days a tape measure --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\na flexible rule,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\na rule that bends.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd Aristotle said,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\n\"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nto design rounded columns,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nyou need to bend the rule.\"\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd Aristotle said\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\noften in dealing with other people,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwe need to bend the rules.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nDealing with other people\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\ndemands a kind of flexibility\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthat no set of rules can encompass.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWise people know when and how\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nto bend the rules.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWise people know how to improvise.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthey are kind of like jazz musicians.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThe rules are like the notes on the page,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand that gets you started,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nbut then you dance around the notes on the page,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\ncoming up with just the right combination\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nfor this particular moment\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwith this particular set of fellow players.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo for Aristotle,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthe kind\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nof rule-bending,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nrule exception-finding and improvisation\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthat you see in skilled craftsmen\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis exactly what you need\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto be a skilled moral craftsman.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd in interactions with people,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nalmost all the time,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nit is this kind of flexibility that is required.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nA wise person knows when to bend the rules.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nA wise person knows when to improvise.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd most important,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\na wise person does this improvising and rule-bending\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin the service of the right aims.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nIf you are a rule-bender and an improviser\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nmostly to serve yourself,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nwhat you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo it matters that you do this wise practice\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nin the service of others\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand not in the service of yourself.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd so the will to do the right thing\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nis just as important as the moral skill\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nof improvisation\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand exception-finding.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nTogether they comprise practical wisdom,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwhich Aristotle thought\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwas the master virtue.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSo I'll give you an example\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof wise practice in action.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIt's the case of Michael.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nMichael's a young guy.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nHe had a pretty low-wage job.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nHe was supporting his wife and a child,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand the child was going to parochial school.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThen he lost his job.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nHe panicked\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nabout being able to support his family.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nOne night, he drank a little too much,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand he robbed a cab driver --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nstole 50 dollars.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nHe robbed him at gunpoint.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nIt was a toy gun.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nHe got caught. He got tried.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nHe got convicted.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThe Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nrequired a minimum sentence for a crime like this\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof two years, 24 months.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThe judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nthought that this made no sense.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nHe had never committed a crime before.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nHe was a responsible husband and father.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHe had been faced with desperate circumstances.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAll this would do is wreck a family.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAnd so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand not only that,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nbut release every day to go to work.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSpend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nHe did. He served out his sentence.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nHe made restitution\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand found himself a new job.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd the family was united.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd it seemed on the road\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nto some sort of a decent life --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\na happy ending to a story\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ninvolving wise improvisation\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nfrom a wise judge.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut it turned out\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthe prosecutor was not happy\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthat Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand sort of invented her own,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand so he appealed.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nfor armed robbery.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nHe did after all have a toy gun.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThe mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nis five years.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nHe won the appeal.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nMichael was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nJudge Forer had to follow the law.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd by the way, this appeal went through\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nafter he had finished serving his sentence,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nso he was out and working at a job\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand taking care of his family\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand he had to go back into jail.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nJudge Forer did what she was required to do,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand then she quit the bench.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd Michael disappeared.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo that is an example,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nboth of wisdom in practice\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand the subversion of wisdom\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nby rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow consider Ms. Dewey.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nMs. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nShe found herself listening to a consultant one day\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwho was trying to help teachers\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nboost the test scores of the kids,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nso that the school\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwould reach the elite category\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nin percentage of kids passing big tests.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAll these schools in Texas compete with one another\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nto achieve these milestones,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand there are bonuses and various other treats\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat come if you beat the other schools.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo here was the consultant's advice:\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nfirst, don't waste your time on kids\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nwho are going to pass the test no matter what you do.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSecond, don't waste your time\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\non kids who can't pass the test\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nno matter what you do.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThird, don't waste your time\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\non kids who moved into the district\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\ntoo late for their scores to be counted.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nFocus all of your time and attention\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\non the kids who are on the bubble,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthe so-called \"bubble kids\" --\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nkids where your intervention\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\ncan get them just maybe over the line\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nfrom failing to passing.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo Ms. Dewey heard this,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand she shook her head in despair\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nwhile fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand nodding approvingly.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's like they were about to go play a football game.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nFor Ms. Dewey,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthis isn't why she became a teacher.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nNow Ken and I are not naive,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand we understand that you need to have rules.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nYou need to have incentives.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nPeople have to make a living.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut the problem\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwith relying on rules and incentives\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nis that they demoralize\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nprofessional activity,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nand they demoralize professional activity\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nin two senses.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nFirst, they demoralize the people\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nwho are engaged in the activity.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nJudge Forer quits,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd second,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthey demoralize the activity itself.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThe very practice is demoralized,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand the practitioners are demoralized.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt creates people --\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nwhen you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nit creates people\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwho are addicted to incentives.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThat is to say, it creates people\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwho only do things for incentives.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nNow the striking thing about this\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nis that psychologists have known this\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nfor 30 years.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nPsychologists have known\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nabout the negative consequences of incentivizing everything\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nfor 30 years.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nWe know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthey stop caring about the drawing\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand care only about the reward.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nIf you reward kids for reading books,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nthey stop caring about what's in the books\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand only care about how long they are.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nIf you reward teachers for kids' test scores,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthey stop caring about educating\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand only care about test preparation.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIf you were to reward doctors\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nfor doing more procedures --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich is the current system -- they would do more.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIf instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthey will do fewer.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWhat we want, of course,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nis doctors who do just the right amount of procedures\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand do the right amount for the right reason --\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nnamely, to serve the welfare of their patients.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nPsychologists have known this for decades,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand it's time for policymakers\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nto start paying attention\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nand listen to psychologists a little bit,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\ninstead of economists.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd it doesn't have to be this way.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nWe think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nWe identify one set of people\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nin all of these practices\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nwho we call canny outlaws.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nThese are people\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwho, being forced to operate\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nin a system that demands rule-following\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand creates incentives,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nfind away around the rules,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nfind a way to subvert the rules.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd so what they do is they follow the scripts,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbut they follow the scripts at double-time\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand squirrel away little bits of extra time\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nduring which they teach in the way\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat they actually know is effective.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nSo these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand they're incredibly admirable,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nbut there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nin the face of a system\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat either roots them out\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nor grinds them down.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo canny outlaws are better than nothing,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nbut it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nsustaining that for an indefinite period of time.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nMore hopeful\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nare people we call system-changers.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThese are people who are looking\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nnot to dodge the system's rules and regulations,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nbut to transform the system,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand we talk about several.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nOne in particular\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nis a judge named Robert Russell.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd one day he was faced\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwith the case of Gary Pettengill.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nPettengill was a 23-year-old vet\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nwho had planned to make the army a career,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nbut then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand that forced him to take a medical discharge.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nHe was married, he had a third kid on the way,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nhe suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nand recurrent nightmares,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nand he had started using marijuana\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nto ease some of the symptoms.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nHe was only able to get part-time work because of his back,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nand take care of his family.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nSo he started selling marijuana.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nHe was busted in a drug sweep.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nHis family was kicked out of their apartment,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand the welfare system\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nwas threatening to take away his kids.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nUnder normal sentencing procedures,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nJudge Russell would have had little choice\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nbut to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nas a drug felon.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nBut Judge Russell did have an alternative.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd that's because he was in a special court.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nHe was in a court called the Veterans' Court.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nIn the Veterans' Court --\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthis was the first of its kind in the United States.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nJudge Russell created the Veterans' Court.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nIt was a court only for veterans\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nwho had broken the law.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd he had created it exactly because\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nmandatory sentencing laws\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nwere taking the judgment out of judging.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nNo one wanted non-violent offenders --\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nand especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nto be thrown into prison.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nThey wanted to do something about what we all know,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nnamely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nAnd what the Veterans' Court did,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nwas it treated each criminal as an individual,\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\ntried to get inside their problems,\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\ntried to fashion responses to their crimes\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nthat helped them to rehabilitate themselves,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nand didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nStayed with them, followed up on them,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nmade sure that they were sticking to whatever plan\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nhad been jointly developed\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nto get them over the hump.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nThere are now 22 cities\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nthat have Veterans' Courts like this.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nWhy has the idea spread?\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nWell, one reason is\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nthat Judge Russell\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nhas now seen 108 vets\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nin his Veterans' Court\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nas of February of this year,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nand out of 108,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nguess how many have gone back through\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthe revolving door of justice\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\ninto prison.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nNone. None.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nAnyone would glom onto\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\na criminal justice system\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nthat has this kind of a record.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nThere's a banker\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nwho created a for-profit community bank\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nthat encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nencouraged bankers who worked there to do well\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nby doing good for their low-income clients.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nThe bank helped finance the rebuilding\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nof what was otherwise a dying community.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nThough their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nthe default rate was extremely low.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nThe bank was profitable.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nThe bankers stayed with their loan recipients.\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nThey didn't make loans and then sell the loans.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nThey serviced the loans.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nThey made sure that their loan recipients\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nwere staying up with their payments.\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nBanking hasn't always been\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nthe way we read about it now in the newspapers.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nEven Goldman Sachs\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nonce used to serve clients,\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nbefore it turned into an institution\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nthat serves only itself.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nBanking wasn't always this way,\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nand it doesn't have to be this way.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nSo there are examples like this in medicine --\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\ndoctors at Harvard\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nwho are trying to transform medical education,\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nso that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nand loss of empathy,\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nwhich characterizes most medical students\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nin the course of their medical training.\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nAnd the way they do it is to give third-year medical students\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\npatients who they follow for an entire year.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nSo the patients are not organ systems,\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nand they're not diseases;\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nthey're people, people with lives.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nAnd in order to be an effective doctor,\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nyou need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nIn addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nmentoring of one student by another,\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nof all the students by the doctors,\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nand the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nwho do have time for the people they treat.\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nWe'll see.\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nSo there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nEach of them shows that it is possible\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nto build on and nurture character\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nand keep a profession\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.958\ntrue to its proper mission --\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nwhat Aristotle would have called its proper telos.\n\n00:21:12.958

00:21:21.958\nto be virtuous.\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nThey want to have permission to do the right thing.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nThey don't want to feel\n\n00:21:26.958 -->

may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins, and I promise I will come back to those virgins. But in fact, here in the Northwest, we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise, defined 36 times as \"gardens watered by running streams.\" Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union, this makes perfect sense to me. But the thing is, how come it's news to most people? I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims who've begun reading the Koran, but given up, disconcerted by its \"otherness.\" The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes, yet even he called the Koran \"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook; a wearisome, confused jumble.\"(Laughter)Part of the problem, I think, is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book \u2014 as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach, as though God \u2014 and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad \u2014 were just another author on the best-seller list. Yet, the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote \u2014 that is, to misquote.(Laughter)Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the \"highlighter version,\" which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.So this past spring, as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad, I realized I needed to read the Koran properly \u2014 as properly as I could, that is. My Arabic is reduced by now to wielding a dictionary, so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side, verse by verse, along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic. Now, I did have an advantage. My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split, and for that, I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories, so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers, its frame of reference. I knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran \u2014 an informed one, an experienced one, even, but still an outsider, an agnostic Jew reading someone else's holy book.(Laughter)So I read slowly.(Laughter)I'd set aside three weeks for this project, and that, I think, is what is meant by \"hubris\" \u2014(Laughter)because it turned out to be three months.(Laughter)I did resist the temptation to skip to the back, where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran \u2014 that feeling of \"I get it now\" \u2014 it would slip away overnight, and I'd come back in the morning, wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land. And yet, the terrain was very familiar. The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels. So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus. God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh, jealously insisting on no other gods. The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. And then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it, reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory. And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic.Take the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined. It's just 29 words in Arabic, but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation. And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing. The Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than read, felt more than analyzed. It wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself, or as Arthur Arberry called his version, \"an interpretation.\" But all is not lost in translation.As the Koran promises, patience is rewarded, and there are many surprises \u2014 a degree of environmental awareness, for instance, and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation, unmatched in the Bible. And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men, using the second- and third-person masculine, the Koran includes women \u2014 talking, for instance, of believing men and believing women, honorable men and honorable women. Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. Yes, it does say that, but in a very specific context: the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca, where fighting was usually forbidden. And the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers. Not \"You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,\" but you can, you are allowed to, but only after a grace period is over, and only if there's no other pact in place, and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba, and only if they attack you first. And even then \u2014 God is merciful; forgiveness is supreme \u2014 and so, essentially, better if you don't.(Laughter)This was perhaps the biggest surprise \u2014 how flexible the Koran is, at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.\"Some of these verses are definite in meaning,\" it says, \"and others are ambiguous.\" The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities, trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own. Only God knows the true meaning. The phrase \"God is subtle\" appears again and again, and indeed, the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe. As in, for instance, that little matter of virgins and paradise. Old-fashioned orientalism comes into play here. The word used four times is \"houris,\" rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts, or as fair, high-bosomed virgins. Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: houris. Not a swelling breast or high bosom in sight.(Laughter)Now this may be a way of saying \"pure beings,\" like in angels, or it may be like the Greek \"kouros\" or \"kore,\" an eternal youth.But the truth is, nobody really knows. And that's the point. Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be \"a new creation in paradise,\" and that you will be \"recreated in a form unknown to you,\" which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin.(Laughter)And that number 72 never appears. There are no 72 virgins in the Koran. That idea only came into being 300 years later, and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps. Paradise is quite the opposite. It's not virginity; it's fecundity; it's plenty. It's gardens watered by running streams.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1045, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:16.506\nYou may have

00:00:24.764\nBut in fact, here in the Northwest,\nwe're living very close\n\n00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.391\nto the real Koranic idea of paradise,\n\n00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:33.060\ndefined 36 times as \"gardens\nwatered by running streams.\"\n\n00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:38.095\nSince I live on a houseboat\non the running stream of Lake Union,\n\n00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.341\nthis makes perfect sense to me.\n\n00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.365\nBut the thing is, how come\nit's news to most people?\n\n00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:46.834\nI know many well-intentioned non-Muslims\n\n00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:49.525\nwho've begun reading\nthe Koran, but given up,\n\n00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.078\ndisconcerted by its \"otherness.\"\n\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.598\nThe historian Thomas Carlyle\nconsidered Muhammad\n\n00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.598\none of the world's greatest heroes,\n\n00:00:57.622 --> 00:01:00.034\nyet even he called the Koran\n\n00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:05.424\n\"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook;\na wearisome, confused jumble.\"\n\n00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:07.724\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:10.754\nPart of the problem,\nI think, is that we imagine\n\n00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:14.434\nthat the Koran can be read\nas we usually read a book --\n\n00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:17.434\nas though we can curl up\nwith it on a rainy afternoon\n\n00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:19.434\nwith a bowl of popcorn within reach,\n\n00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:20.978\nas though God --\n\n00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.744\nand the Koran is entirely in the voice\nof God speaking to Muhammad --\n\n00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:27.562\nwere just another author\non the best-seller list.\n\n00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:33.686\nYet, the fact that so few people\ndo actually read the Koran\n\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.972\nis precisely why it's so easy to quote --\nthat is, to misquote.\n\n00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:40.020\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:42.434\nPhrases and snippets taken out of context\n\n00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:44.534\nin what I call the \"highlighter version,\"\n\n00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:47.645\nwhich is the one favored\nby both Muslim fundamentalists\n\n00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:50.434\nand anti-Muslim Islamophobes.\n\n00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:52.780\nSo this past spring,\n\n00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:56.866\nas I was gearing up to begin writing\na biography of Muhammad,\n\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.124\nI realized I needed to read\nthe Koran properly --\n\n00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:03.910\nas properly as I could, that is.\n\n00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:07.044\nMy Arabic is reduced by now\nto wielding a dictionary,\n\n00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:09.434\nso I took four well-known translations\n\n00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:13.623\nand decided to read them\nside by side, verse by verse,\n\n00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:18.516\nalong with a transliteration\nand the original seventh-century Arabic.\n\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.458\nNow, I did have an advantage.\n\n00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:29.109\nMy last book was about the story\nbehind the Shi'a-Sunni split,\n\n00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.546\nand for that, I'd worked closely\nwith the earliest Islamic histories,\n\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.332\nso I knew the events\nto which the Koran constantly refers,\n\n00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.333\nits frame of reference.\n\n00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:43.434\nI knew enough, that is, to know\nthat I'd be a tourist in the Koran --\n\n00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.434\nan informed one,\n\n00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:46.933\nan experienced one, even,\n\n00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:49.306\nbut still an outsider,\n\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.152\nan agnostic Jew reading\nsomeone else's holy book.\n\n00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:55.251\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.845\nSo I read slowly.\n\n00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:01.354\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:03.865\nI'd set aside three weeks\nfor this project,\n\n00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.759\nand that, I think,\nis what is meant by \"hubris\" --\n\n00:03:06.783 --> 00:03:11.069\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:13.269\nbecause it turned out to be three months.\n\n00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.180\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:17.702\nI did resist the temptation\nto skip to the back,\n\n00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:20.893\nwhere the shorter and more\nclearly mystical chapters are.\n\n00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:24.434\nBut every time I thought I was beginning\nto get a handle on the Koran --\n\n00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.740\nthat feeling of \"I get it now\" --\n\n00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:28.827\nit would slip away overnight,\n\n00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:30.505\nand I'd come back in the morning,\n\n00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.257\nwondering if I wasn't lost\nin a strange land.\n\n00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.513\nAnd yet, the terrain was very familiar.\n\n00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:40.138\nThe Koran declares that it comes\nto renew the message\n\n00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:41.595\nof the Torah and the Gospels.\n\n00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.107\nSo one-third of it reprises\nthe stories of Biblical figures\n\n00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.660\nlike Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.\n\n00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.343\nGod himself was utterly familiar\n\n00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:56.434\nfrom his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,\n\n00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:59.458\njealously insisting on no other gods.\n\n00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:05.660\nThe presence of camels, mountains,\ndesert wells and springs\n\n00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:09.115\ntook me back to the year I spent\nwandering the Sinai Desert.\n\n00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:13.434\nAnd then there was the language,\nthe rhythmic cadence of it,\n\n00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:16.679\nreminding me of evenings spent\nlistening to Bedouin elders\n\n00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:19.680\nrecite hours-long narrative poems\n\n00:04:19.704 --> 00:04:21.571\nentirely from memory.\n\n00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:27.488\nAnd I began to grasp why it's said\n\n00:04:27.512 --> 00:04:31.624\nthat the Koran is really\nthe Koran only in Arabic.\n\n00:04:32.497 --> 00:04:36.385\nTake the Fatihah,\nthe seven-verse opening chapter\n\n00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.409\nthat is the Lord's Prayer\nand the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.995\nIt's just 29 words in Arabic,\n\n00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.860\nbut anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.\n\n00:04:47.884 --> 00:04:51.651\nAnd yet the more you add,\nthe more seems to go missing.\n\n00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:57.434\nThe Arabic has an incantatory,\nalmost hypnotic quality\n\n00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.716\nthat begs to be heard rather than read,\n\n00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.510\nfelt more than analyzed.\n\n00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:05.262\nIt wants to be chanted out loud,\n\n00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:08.070\nto sound its music in the ear\nand on the tongue.\n\n00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:13.434\nSo the Koran in English\nis a kind of shadow of itself,\n\n00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:16.289\nor as Arthur Arberry called his version,\n\n00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:17.661\n\"an interpretation.\"\n\n00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:22.004\nBut all is not lost in translation.\n\n00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:25.434\nAs the Koran promises,\npatience is rewarded,\n\n00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.007\nand there are many surprises --\n\n00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:30.187\na degree of environmental\nawareness, for instance,\n\n00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.780\nand of humans as mere stewards\nof God's creation,\n\n00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:35.438\nunmatched in the Bible.\n\n00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:39.184\nAnd where the Bible is addressed\nexclusively to men,\n\n00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.834\nusing the second-\nand third-person masculine,\n\n00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:44.434\nthe Koran includes women --\n\n00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:45.882\ntalking, for instance,\n\n00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:48.330\nof believing men and believing women,\n\n00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:51.542\nhonorable men and honorable women.\n\n00:05:52.942 --> 00:05:56.919\nOr take the infamous verse\nabout killing the unbelievers.\n\n00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:59.434\nYes, it does say that,\n\n00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:02.184\nbut in a very specific context:\n\n00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:06.545\nthe anticipated conquest\nof the sanctuary city of Mecca,\n\n00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.093\nwhere fighting was usually forbidden.\n\n00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:12.640\nAnd the permission comes\nhedged about with qualifiers.\n\n00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:15.434\nNot \"You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,\"\n\n00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.697\nbut you can, you are allowed to,\n\n00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:22.092\nbut only after a grace period is over,\n\n00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:24.974\nand only if there's no other\npact in place,\n\n00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:28.434\nand only if they try to stop\nyou getting to the Kaaba,\n\n00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:31.174\nand only if they attack you first.\n\n00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:34.803\nAnd even then -- God is merciful;\n\n00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.856\nforgiveness is supreme --\n\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.598\nand so, essentially,\n\n00:06:39.622 --> 00:06:41.075\nbetter if you don't.\n\n00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.541\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:47.328\nThis was perhaps the biggest surprise --\n\n00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:49.434\nhow flexible the Koran is,\n\n00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:53.143\nat least in minds that are not\nfundamentally inflexible.\n\n00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:58.001\n\"Some of these verses\nare definite in meaning,\" it says,\n\n00:06:58.025 --> 00:06:59.894\n\"and others are ambiguous.\"\n\n00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:04.641\nThe perverse at heart\nwill seek out the ambiguities,\n\n00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:09.294\ntrying to create discord\nby pinning down meanings of their own.\n\n00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:11.608\nOnly God knows the true meaning.\n\n00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:16.951\nThe phrase \"God is subtle\"\nappears again and again,\n\n00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:19.577\nand indeed, the whole\nof the Koran is far more subtle\n\n00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:22.105\nthan most of us have been led to believe.\n\n00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:27.197\nAs in, for instance, that little matter\nof virgins and paradise.\n\n00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:31.573\nOld-fashioned orientalism\ncomes into play here.\n\n00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:37.127\nThe word used four times is \"houris,\"\n\n00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:41.608\nrendered as dark-eyed maidens\nwith swelling breasts,\n\n00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:44.825\nor as fair, high-bosomed virgins.\n\n00:07:45.897 --> 00:07:50.458\nYet all there is in the original Arabic\nis that one word: houris.\n\n00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.707\nNot a swelling breast\nor high bosom in sight.\n\n00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:56.235\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:00.816\nNow this may be a way of saying\n\"pure beings,\" like in angels,\n\n00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.853\nor it may be like\nthe Greek \"kouros\" or \"kore,\"\n\n00:08:03.877 --> 00:08:05.219\nan eternal youth.\n\n00:08:05.243 --> 00:08:07.979\nBut the truth is, nobody really knows.\n\n00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:09.247\nAnd that's the point.\n\n00:08:10.164 --> 00:08:12.580\nBecause the Koran is quite clear\n\n00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:17.434\nwhen it says that you'll be\n\"a new creation in paradise,\"\n\n00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:22.587\nand that you will be \"recreated\nin a form unknown to you,\"\n\n00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:25.146\nwhich seems to me\na far more appealing prospect\n\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.749\nthan a virgin.\n\n00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:33.745\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.261\nAnd that number 72 never appears.\n\n00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:41.951\nThere are no 72 virgins in the Koran.\n\n00:08:41.975 --> 00:08:45.220\nThat idea only came\ninto being 300 years later,\n\n00:08:45.244 --> 00:08:48.221\nand most Islamic scholars\nsee it as the equivalent\n\n00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:51.847\nof people with wings sitting on clouds\nand strumming harps.\n\n00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:55.936\nParadise is quite the opposite.\n\n00:08:56.809 --> 00:08:58.572\nIt's not virginity;\n\n00:08:58.596 --> 00:09:00.080\nit's fecundity;\n\n00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.162\nit's plenty.\n\n00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:06.563\nIt's gardens watered by running streams.\n\n00:09:08.218 --> 00:09:09.370\nThank you.\n\n00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:16.371\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Your brain on improv", "duration": "991", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/charles_limb_your_brain_on_improv", "transcript": "So I am a surgeon who studies creativity, and I have never had a patient tell me, \"I really want you to be creative during surgery,\" and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it. I will say though that, after having done surgery a lot, it's similar to playing a musical instrument. And for me, this deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the science of sound, particularly music. I'm going to talk over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to study music and try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative. I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University, and at the National Institute of Health where I was previously. I'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments.I will start off by playing a video for you. This video is of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known, iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level. And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head, and he'll never play it exactly the same way again, so as a form of intense creativity, I think this is a great example. And so why don't we go and click the video.(Music)(Music ends)It's really a remarkable thing that happens there. I've always as a listener, as a fan, I listen to that, and I'm astounded. I think \u2014 how can this possibly be? How can the brain generate that much information, that much music, spontaneously? And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain. There's not too many brain-dead people creating art. With this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product, I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process, and there are subquestions that I put there. Is it possible to study creativity scientifically? And I think that's a good question. And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music, they're very dense, and when you go through them, it's very hard to recognize the music in it. In fact, they seem to be unmusical entirely and to miss the point of the music.This brings the second question: Why should scientists study creativity? Maybe we're not the right people to do it.(Laughter)Well it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective, we talked a lot about innovation today, the science of innovation, how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy, and truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative. I think that we're going to see, over the next 10, 20, 30 years, a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish, Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process like complex jazz improvisation, and study it rigorously. So it gets down to the brain. All of us have this remarkable brain, which is poorly understood, to say the least. I think that neuroscientists have more questions than answers, and I'm not going to give you answers today, just ask a lot of questions.And that's what I do in my lab. I ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this. This is the main method that I use. This is functional MRI. If you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same, but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain, but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. The way that's done is by the following: There's something called BOLD imaging, which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging. When you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas. When an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active, it gets blood flow shunted to that area. That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration. Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI, whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. So through this method of inference \u2014 and we're measuring blood flow, not neural activity \u2014 we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task, and that's the crux of how fMRI works. And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes.I'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. It was done with a colleague, Alan Braun, at the NIH. This is a short video of how we did this project.(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments. And it's a 35-key keyboard designed to fit both inside the scanner, be magnetically safe, have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact, and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner, playing on their back. It works like this \u2014 this doesn't actually produce any sound. It sends out what's called a MIDI signal \u2014 or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface \u2014 through these wires into the box and then the computer, which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this.(Music)(Music)(Music ends)OK, so it works. And so through this piano keyboard, we have the means to take a musical process and study it. So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard? You can't just say, \"It's great we have a keyboard.\" We have to come up with a scientific experiment. The experiment really rests on the following: What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned, and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated, or improvised, in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features?I have here what we call the paradigms. There's a scale paradigm, which is playing a scale up and down, memorized, then there's improvising on a scale, quarter notes, metronome, right hand \u2014 scientifically very safe, but musically really boring. Then there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm. So we brought professional jazz players to the NIH, and we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower-left, which is what you heard me playing \u2014 and we had them improvise to the same chord changes. And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon, that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner.(Music)(Music ends)In the end, it's not the most natural environment, but they're able to play real music. And I've listened to that solo 200 times, and I still like it. And the musicians were comfortable in the end. We first measured the number of notes. Were they playing more notes when they were improvising? That was not what was going on. And then we looked at the brain activity. I will try to condense this for you. These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising vs. when you're doing something memorized. In red is an area that's active in the prefrontal cortex, the frontal lobe of the brain, and in blue is this area that was deactivated. So we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity. We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity, I'll summarize that for you.These are multifunctional areas of the brain, these are not the jazz areas of the brain. They do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection, introspection, working memory etc. Really, consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe. But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring, turning off, and this area that's thought to be autobiographical, or self-expressive, turning on. We think, at least in this preliminary \u2014 it's one study; it's probably wrong, but it's one study \u2014(Laughter)we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that, to be creative, you should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe. One area turns on, and a big area shuts off, so that you're not inhibited, you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses. Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity \u2014 sometimes it's done communicatively.The next question was: What happens when musicians are trading back and forth, something called \"trading fours,\" which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment. So this is a 12-bar blues, and I've broken it down into four-bar groups, so you would know how you would trade. We brought a musician into the scanner, same way, had them memorize this melody then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively.So this is a musician, Mike Pope, one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player.(Music)He's now playing the piece that we just saw a little better than I wrote it.(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.Mike Pope: May the force be with you.Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.CL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to do it.(Laughter)It's kind of fun, actually.(Music)Now we're playing back and forth. He's in there. You can see his legs up there.(Music)And then I'm in the control room here, playing back and forth.(Music)(Music ends)(Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation of what it's like. And it's good that it's not too quick. The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing, looking at my hands through two mirrors, laying on my back, and not able to move at all except for my hand. That was challenging. But again \u2014 there were moments, for sure \u2014(Laughter)there were moments of real, honest-to-God musical interplay, for sure.CL: At this point, I'll take a few moments. So what you're seeing here \u2014 and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science, which is to show you preliminary data. This is one subject's data. This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data. So what am I showing you here? When he was trading fours with me, improvising vs. memorized, his language areas lit up, his Broca's area, in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left. He had it also homologous on the right. This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication. This whole notion that music is a language \u2014 maybe there's a neurologic basis to it after all, and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. So we've done this on eight subjects now, and we're getting all the data together, hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully.Now when I think about improvisation and the language, what's next? Rap, of course, rap \u2014 freestyle. I've always been fascinated by freestyle. And let's play this video.(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be, standing five-ten I be Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry Go and try to injure me, broke 'em down chemically Ain't the number 10 MC, talk about how been I be Styled it like Kennedy, late like a 10 to three When I say when I be, girls say bend that key cutCL: So there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in freestyle rap and jazz. There are a lot of correlates between the two forms of music, I think, in different time periods, in lot of ways, rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve. So how do you study rap scientifically? And my colleagues think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable. This is what you do: You have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap that you write for them, that they've never heard before, and then you have them freestyle. So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED, and they said, \"No, you won't.\" And then I thought \u2014(Laughter)(Applause)But here's the thing. With this big screen, you can all rap with me. OK? So what we had them do was memorize this lower-left sound icon, please. This is the control condition. This is what they memorized.Computer: Memory, thump.CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strikeComputer: Search.CL: I search for the truth in this eternal quest My passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed Psychopathic words in my head appear Whisper these lyrics only I can hearComputer: Art.CL: The art of discovering and that which is hovering Inside the mind of those unconfined All of these words keep pouring out like rain I need a mad scientist to check my brainComputer: Stop.(Applause)I guarantee you that will never happen again.(Laughter)So now, what's great about these free-stylers, they will get cued different words. They don't know what's coming, but they'll hear something off the cuff. Go hit that right sound icon, there will be cued three square words: like, not and head. He doesn't know what's coming. Computer: Like.Freestyler: I'm like some kind of extraterrestrial, celestial scene Back in the days, I used to sit in pyramids and meditateWith two microphones \u2014 Computer: Head hovering over my head See if I could still listen, spittin' off the sound See what you grinning I teach the children in the back of the classroom About the message of apocalypticalComputer: Not. Not really though, 'cause I've got to keep it simple instrumental Detrimental playing Super Mario boxes [unclear] hip hopComputer: Stop.CL: It's an incredible thing that's taking place. It's doing something neurologically remarkable. Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant. Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing. This is a short video of how we do this in a scanner.[fMRI of Hip-Hop Rap](Laughter)(Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel.CL: That was recorded in the scanner, by the way.(Video) CL: That's Emmanuel in the scanner. He's just memorized a rhyme for us.[Control Condition Memorized Verses]Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeat Rhythm and rhyme make me complete Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strikeComputer: Search. I search for the truth in this eternal quest I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressedCL: I'm going to stop that there; so what do we see in his brain? This is four rappers' brains. And we do see language areas lighting up, but then, eyes closed \u2014 when you are freestyling vs. memorizing, you've got major visual areas lighting up. You've got major cerebellar activity, which is involved in motor coordination. You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task, when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. It's very preliminary, but I think it's kind of cool.To conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask, and like I said, we'll ask questions here, not answer them. But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius neurologically, and I think, with these methods, we're getting close. And I think, hopefully in the next 10, 20 years, you'll see real, meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art, and maybe we're starting now to get there.Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.(Applause)", "id": 1046, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:15.216\nSo I am a surgeon who studies creativity,\n\n00:00:15.240

--> 00:00:36.813\nand to study the science\nof sound, particularly music.\n\n00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.886\nI'm going to talk\nover the next few minutes\n\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.201\nabout my career\n\n00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:42.509\nin terms of how I'm able to study music\n\n00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.567\nand try to grapple\nwith all these questions\n\n00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:46.934\nof how the brain is able to be creative.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.588\nI've done most of this work\nat Johns Hopkins University,\n\n00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:52.597\nand at the National Institute\nof Health where I was previously.\n\n00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:56.128\nI'll go over some science experiments\nand cover three musical experiments.\n\n00:00:56.152 --> 00:00:58.208\nI will start off by playing\na video for you.\n\n00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:01.335\nThis video is of Keith Jarrett,\nwho's a well-known jazz improviser\n\n00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.803\nand probably the most\nwell-known, iconic example\n\n00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:06.320\nof someone who takes improvisation\nto a higher level.\n\n00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:09.483\nAnd he'll improvise entire concerts\noff the top of his head,\n\n00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:11.912\nand he'll never play it\nexactly the same way again,\n\n00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:13.921\nso as a form of intense creativity,\n\n00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.563\nI think this is a great example.\n\n00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:17.934\nAnd so why don't we go\nand click the video.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\n(Music)\n\n00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:15.754\n(Music ends)\n\n00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:18.117\nIt's really a remarkable\nthing that happens there.\n\n00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:19.869\nI've always as a listener, as a fan,\n\n00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:21.610\nI listen to that, and I'm astounded.\n\n00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:23.370\nI think -- how can this possibly be?\n\n00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:25.685\nHow can the brain generate\nthat much information,\n\n00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.294\nthat much music, spontaneously?\n\n00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:29.934\nAnd so I set out\nwith this concept, scientifically,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:34.309\nthat artistic creativity,\nit's magical, but it's not magic,\n\n00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.340\nmeaning that it's a product of the brain.\n\n00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.798\nThere's not too many brain-dead\npeople creating art.\n\n00:02:38.822 --> 00:02:42.453\nWith this notion that artistic creativity\nis in fact a neurologic product,\n\n00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:44.934\nI took this thesis that we could study it\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.072\njust like we study any other\ncomplex neurologic process,\n\n00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:50.151\nand there are subquestions\nthat I put there.\n\n00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:52.561\nIs it possible to study\ncreativity scientifically?\n\n00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:54.622\nAnd I think that's a good question.\n\n00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:57.332\nAnd I'll tell you that most\nscientific studies of music,\n\n00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:58.874\nthey're very dense,\n\n00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:00.293\nand when you go through them,\n\n00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:02.387\nit's very hard to recognize\nthe music in it.\n\n00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.630\nIn fact, they seem to be\nunmusical entirely\n\n00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.448\nand to miss the point of the music.\n\n00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:08.028\nThis brings the second question:\n\n00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:09.934\nWhy should scientists study creativity?\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.037\nMaybe we're not the right people to do it.\n\n00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:13.060\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:16.536\nWell it may be, but I will say that,\nfrom a scientific perspective,\n\n00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.578\nwe talked a lot about innovation today,\n\n00:03:18.602 --> 00:03:19.934\nthe science of innovation,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.911\nhow much we understand\nabout how the brain is able to innovate\n\n00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.179\nis in its infancy,\n\n00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.670\nand truly, we know very little\nabout how we are able to be creative.\n\n00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:29.218\nI think that we're going to see,\n\n00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.934\nover the next 10, 20, 30 years,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.129\na real science of creativity\nthat's burgeoning\n\n00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:34.354\nand is going to flourish,\n\n00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:36.810\nBecause we now have new methods\nthat can enable us\n\n00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:39.358\nto take this process\nlike complex jazz improvisation,\n\n00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:40.756\nand study it rigorously.\n\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.927\nSo it gets down to the brain.\n\n00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.745\nAll of us have this remarkable brain,\n\n00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.224\nwhich is poorly understood,\nto say the least.\n\n00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:51.446\nI think that neuroscientists\nhave more questions than answers,\n\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.672\nand I'm not going\nto give you answers today,\n\n00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.057\njust ask a lot of questions.\n\n00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:56.588\nAnd that's what I do in my lab.\n\n00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:59.926\nI ask questions about what is the brain\ndoing to enable us to do this.\n\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.727\nThis is the main method that I use.\nThis is functional MRI.\n\n00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:05.474\nIf you've been in an MRI scanner,\nit's very much the same,\n\n00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:09.413\nbut this one is outfitted in a special way\nto not just take pictures of your brain,\n\n00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:12.364\nbut to also take pictures\nof active areas of the brain.\n\n00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:14.293\nThe way that's done is by the following:\n\n00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:16.127\nThere's something called BOLD imaging,\n\n00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.550\nwhich is Blood Oxygen\nLevel Dependent imaging.\n\n00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.824\nWhen you're in an fMRI scanner,\nyou're in a big magnet\n\n00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:24.221\nthat's aligning your molecules\nin certain areas.\n\n00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:27.964\nWhen an area of the brain is active,\nmeaning a neural area is active,\n\n00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:30.226\nit gets blood flow shunted to that area.\n\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.600\nThat blood flow causes an increase\nin local blood to that area\n\n00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:37.607\nwith a deoxyhemoglobin\nchange in concentration.\n\n00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:39.786\nDeoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,\n\n00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.660\nwhereas oxyhemoglobin can't.\n\n00:04:41.684 --> 00:04:43.638\nSo through this method of inference --\n\n00:04:43.662 --> 00:04:46.204\nand we're measuring blood flow,\nnot neural activity --\n\n00:04:46.228 --> 00:04:48.964\nwe say that an area of the brain\nthat's getting more blood\n\n00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:52.530\nwas active during a particular task,\nand that's the crux of how fMRI works.\n\n00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:56.459\nAnd it's been used since the '90s\nto study really complex processes.\n\n00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.983\nI'm going to review a study that I did,\nwhich was jazz in an fMRI scanner.\n\n00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:02.510\nIt was done with a colleague,\nAlan Braun, at the NIH.\n\n00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.934\nThis is a short video\nof how we did this project.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.739\n(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic\nMIDI piano keyboard\n\n00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:09.544\nthat we use for the jazz experiments.\n\n00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:11.621\nAnd it's a 35-key keyboard\n\n00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:14.105\ndesigned to fit both inside the scanner,\n\n00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:15.465\nbe magnetically safe,\n\n00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:19.331\nhave minimal interference\nthat would contribute to any artifact,\n\n00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:22.275\nand have this cushion\nso that it can rest on the players' legs\n\n00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:25.254\nwhile they're lying down in the scanner,\nplaying on their back.\n\n00:05:25.278 --> 00:05:28.307\nIt works like this --\nthis doesn't actually produce any sound.\n\n00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.774\nIt sends out what's called\na MIDI signal --\n\n00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:32.847\nor a Musical Instrument\nDigital Interface --\n\n00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:35.532\nthrough these wires into the box\nand then the computer,\n\n00:05:35.556 --> 00:05:38.491\nwhich then trigger\nhigh-quality piano samples like this.\n\n00:05:38.515 --> 00:05:41.756\n(Music)\n\n00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:48.761\n(Music)\n\n00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.266\n(Music ends)\n\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.934\nOK, so it works.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.934\nAnd so through this piano keyboard,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.701\nwe have the means to take\na musical process and study it.\n\n00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:15.652\nSo what do you do now that you have\nthis cool piano keyboard?\n\n00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.121\nYou can't just say,\n\"It's great we have a keyboard.\"\n\n00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.469\nWe have to come up\nwith a scientific experiment.\n\n00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:22.616\nThe experiment\nreally rests on the following:\n\n00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:26.531\nWhat happens in the brain during something\nthat's memorized and over-learned,\n\n00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:28.710\nand what happens in the brain\nduring something\n\n00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:31.008\nthat is spontaneously\ngenerated, or improvised,\n\n00:06:31.032 --> 00:06:32.846\nin a way that's matched motorically\n\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.715\nand in terms of lower-level\nsensory motor features?\n\n00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:38.334\nI have here what we call the paradigms.\n\n00:06:38.358 --> 00:06:41.854\nThere's a scale paradigm, which is playing\na scale up and down, memorized,\n\n00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:43.612\nthen there's improvising on a scale,\n\n00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.673\nquarter notes, metronome, right hand --\n\n00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.268\nscientifically very safe,\n\n00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:49.165\nbut musically really boring.\n\n00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.160\nThen there's the bottom one,\nwhich is called the jazz paradigm.\n\n00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:54.588\nSo we brought professional\njazz players to the NIH,\n\n00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:57.565\nand we had them memorize\nthis piece of music on the lower-left,\n\n00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.407\nwhich is what you heard me playing --\n\n00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:01.924\nand we had them improvise\nto the same chord changes.\n\n00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:04.156\nAnd if you can hit\nthat lower-right sound icon,\n\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.008\nthat's an example\nof what was recorded in the scanner.\n\n00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:10.762\n(Music)\n\n00:07:31.762 --> 00:07:33.763\n(Music ends)\n\n00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.203\nIn the end, it's not the most\nnatural environment,\n\n00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:38.133\nbut they're able to play real music.\n\n00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.128\nAnd I've listened to that solo 200 times,\n\n00:07:40.152 --> 00:07:41.329\nand I still like it.\n\n00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:43.740\nAnd the musicians\nwere comfortable in the end.\n\n00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:45.588\nWe first measured the number of notes.\n\n00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:48.269\nWere they playing more notes\nwhen they were improvising?\n\n00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:49.883\nThat was not what was going on.\n\n00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:51.892\nAnd then we looked at the brain activity.\n\n00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:53.724\nI will try to condense this for you.\n\n00:07:53.748 --> 00:07:57.228\nThese are contrast maps that are showing\nsubtractions between what changes\n\n00:07:57.252 --> 00:08:00.348\nwhen you're improvising\nvs. when you're doing something memorized.\n\n00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:03.157\nIn red is an area that's active\nin the prefrontal cortex,\n\n00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:04.640\nthe frontal lobe of the brain,\n\n00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:06.843\nand in blue is this area\nthat was deactivated.\n\n00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:09.743\nSo we had this focal area\ncalled the medial prefrontal cortex\n\n00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.154\nthat went way up in activity.\n\n00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:14.408\nWe had this broad patch of area\ncalled the lateral prefrontal cortex\n\n00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:15.957\nthat went way down in activity,\n\n00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:17.469\nI'll summarize that for you.\n\n00:08:17.493 --> 00:08:19.601\nThese are multifunctional\nareas of the brain,\n\n00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.780\nthese are not the jazz areas of the brain.\n\n00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:23.732\nThey do a whole host of things\n\n00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:25.615\nthat have to do with self-reflection,\n\n00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.999\nintrospection, working memory etc.\n\n00:08:28.023 --> 00:08:30.510\nReally, consciousness is seated\nin the frontal lobe.\n\n00:08:30.534 --> 00:08:32.568\nBut we have this combination\n\n00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:36.041\nof an area that's thought to be involved\nin self-monitoring, turning off,\n\n00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.528\nand this area that's thought\nto be autobiographical,\n\n00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:40.087\nor self-expressive, turning on.\n\n00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:42.182\nWe think, at least in this preliminary --\n\n00:08:42.206 --> 00:08:44.959\nit's one study; it's probably wrong,\nbut it's one study --\n\n00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.022\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:48.777\nwe think that at least\na reasonable hypothesis\n\n00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:49.962\nis that, to be creative,\n\n00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:52.862\nyou should have this weird dissociation\nin your frontal lobe.\n\n00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:55.410\nOne area turns on,\nand a big area shuts off,\n\n00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:58.372\nso that you're not inhibited,\nyou're willing to make mistakes,\n\n00:08:58.396 --> 00:09:00.564\nso that you're not constantly\nshutting down\n\n00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:02.513\nall of these new generative impulses.\n\n00:09:02.537 --> 00:09:05.982\nNow a lot of people know that music\nis not always a solo activity --\n\n00:09:06.006 --> 00:09:07.726\nsometimes it's done communicatively.\n\n00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.934\nThe next question was:\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.530\nWhat happens when musicians\nare trading back and forth,\n\n00:09:11.554 --> 00:09:13.167\nsomething called \"trading fours,\"\n\n00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:16.014\nwhich is something they do\nnormally in a jazz experiment.\n\n00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:17.451\nSo this is a 12-bar blues,\n\n00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:19.584\nand I've broken it\ndown into four-bar groups,\n\n00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:21.420\nso you would know how you would trade.\n\n00:09:21.444 --> 00:09:23.730\nWe brought a musician\ninto the scanner, same way,\n\n00:09:23.754 --> 00:09:25.166\nhad them memorize this melody\n\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.756\nthen had another musician\nout in the control room\n\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.749\ntrading back and forth interactively.\n\n00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:32.397\nSo this is a musician, Mike Pope,\n\n00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:35.507\none of the world's best bassists\nand a fantastic piano player.\n\n00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:41.790\n(Music)\n\n00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:44.180\nHe's now playing the piece\nthat we just saw\n\n00:09:44.204 --> 00:09:45.934\na little better than I wrote it.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.724\n(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.\n\n00:09:47.748 --> 00:09:49.518\nMike Pope: May the force be with you.\n\n00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:51.308\nNurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?\n\n00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:52.875\nMP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.\n\n00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:05.313\nCL: You have to have the right\nattitude to agree to do it.\n\n00:10:05.337 --> 00:10:06.593\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:08.432\nIt's kind of fun, actually.\n\n00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:10.055\n(Music)\n\n00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.778\nNow we're playing back and forth.\n\n00:10:11.802 --> 00:10:14.014\nHe's in there.\nYou can see his legs up there.\n\n00:10:14.038 --> 00:10:15.380\n(Music)\n\n00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:18.594\nAnd then I'm in the control room here,\nplaying back and forth.\n\n00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:25.618\n(Music)\n\n00:10:28.088 --> 00:10:29.238\n(Music ends)\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.302\n(Video) Mike Pope:\nThis is a pretty good representation\n\n00:10:33.326 --> 00:10:35.110\nof what it's like.\n\n00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:37.134\nAnd it's good that it's not too quick.\n\n00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.737\nThe fact that we do it over and over again\n\n00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:43.031\nlets you acclimate to your surroundings.\n\n00:10:43.991 --> 00:10:46.649\nSo the hardest thing for me\nwas the kinesthetic thing,\n\n00:10:46.673 --> 00:10:49.934\nlooking at my hands through two mirrors,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.934\nlaying on my back,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.636\nand not able to move at all\nexcept for my hand.\n\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.532\nThat was challenging.\n\n00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:57.706\nBut again --\n\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.696\nthere were moments, for sure --\n\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.721\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:07.108\nthere were moments of real, honest-to-God\nmusical interplay, for sure.\n\n00:11:07.744 --> 00:11:09.746\nCL: At this point,\nI'll take a few moments.\n\n00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.651\nSo what you're seeing here --\n\n00:11:11.675 --> 00:11:13.752\nand I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,\n\n00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:15.586\nwhich is to show you preliminary data.\n\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.363\nThis is one subject's data.\n\n00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:19.134\nThis is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.\n\n00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:20.634\nSo what am I showing you here?\n\n00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:24.769\nWhen he was trading fours with me,\nimprovising vs. memorized,\n\n00:11:24.793 --> 00:11:27.542\nhis language areas lit up,\nhis Broca's area,\n\n00:11:27.566 --> 00:11:29.628\nin the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.\n\n00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:31.561\nHe had it also homologous on the right.\n\n00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:34.744\nThis is an area thought to be\ninvolved in expressive communication.\n\n00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:36.896\nThis whole notion\nthat music is a language --\n\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.219\nmaybe there's a neurologic\nbasis to it after all,\n\n00:11:39.243 --> 00:11:42.597\nand we can see it when two musicians\nare having a musical conversation.\n\n00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:44.594\nSo we've done this on eight subjects now,\n\n00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:46.547\nand we're getting all the data together,\n\n00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:49.396\nhopefully we'll have something\nto say about it meaningfully.\n\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.663\nNow when I think about improvisation\nand the language, what's next?\n\n00:11:52.687 --> 00:11:54.934\nRap, of course, rap -- freestyle.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.705\nI've always been fascinated by freestyle.\n\n00:11:57.729 --> 00:11:59.242\nAnd let's play this video.\n\n00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:02.104\n(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be,\nstanding five-ten I be\n\n00:12:02.128 --> 00:12:04.150\nRockin' it when I be, in your vicinity\n\n00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:07.194\nWhole-style synergy, recognize symmetry\n\n00:12:07.218 --> 00:12:09.552\nGo and try to injure me,\nbroke 'em down chemically\n\n00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:12.005\nAin't the number 10 MC,\ntalk about how been I be\n\n00:12:12.029 --> 00:12:14.427\nStyled it like Kennedy,\nlate like a 10 to three\n\n00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:17.269\nWhen I say when I be,\ngirls say bend that key cut\n\n00:12:17.293 --> 00:12:19.111\nCL: So there's a lot of analogy\n\n00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:21.591\nbetween what takes place\nin freestyle rap and jazz.\n\n00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:24.532\nThere are a lot of correlates\nbetween the two forms of music,\n\n00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:27.003\nI think, in different time periods,\nin lot of ways,\n\n00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:29.858\nrap serves the same social function\nthat jazz used to serve.\n\n00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.775\nSo how do you study rap scientifically?\n\n00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:34.934\nAnd my colleagues think I'm crazy,\nbut I think it's very viable.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.185\nThis is what you do:\n\n00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:38.956\nYou have a freestyle artist come\nand memorize a rap\n\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.201\nthat you write for them,\n\n00:12:40.225 --> 00:12:43.657\nthat they've never heard before,\nand then you have them freestyle.\n\n00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:46.099\nSo I told my lab members\nthat I would rap for TED,\n\n00:12:46.123 --> 00:12:47.765\nand they said, \"No, you won't.\"\n\n00:12:47.789 --> 00:12:48.992\nAnd then I thought --\n\n00:12:49.016 --> 00:12:50.332\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:56.082\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:56.106 --> 00:12:57.386\nBut here's the thing.\n\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.311\nWith this big screen,\nyou can all rap with me. OK?\n\n00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:02.179\nSo what we had them do\n\n00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:04.799\nwas memorize this lower-left\nsound icon, please.\n\n00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:07.716\nThis is the control condition.\nThis is what they memorized.\n\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.773\nComputer: Memory, thump.\n\n00:13:09.797 --> 00:13:11.934\nCL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.934\nRhythm and rhyme, they make me complete\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.054\nThe climb is sublime when I'm on the mic\n\n00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:19.634\nSpittin' rhymes that hit you\nlike a lightning strike\n\n00:13:19.658 --> 00:13:20.822\nComputer: Search.\n\n00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:23.190\nCL: I search for the truth\nin this eternal quest\n\n00:13:23.214 --> 00:13:25.944\nMy passion's not fashion,\nyou can see how I'm dressed\n\n00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:27.934\nPsychopathic words in my head appear\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.196\nWhisper these lyrics only I can hear\n\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.392\nComputer: Art.\n\n00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:34.046\nCL: The art of discovering\nand that which is hovering\n\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.934\nInside the mind of those unconfined\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.934\nAll of these words keep\npouring out like rain\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.693\nI need a mad scientist to check my brain\n\n00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:43.024\nComputer: Stop.\n\n00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:50.048\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:52.228 --> 00:13:54.402\nI guarantee you\nthat will never happen again.\n\n00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:56.367\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.391 --> 00:13:58.579\nSo now, what's great\nabout these free-stylers,\n\n00:13:58.603 --> 00:14:00.465\nthey will get cued different words.\n\n00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:01.933\nThey don't know what's coming,\n\n00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:03.873\nbut they'll hear something off the cuff.\n\n00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:05.306\nGo hit that right sound icon,\n\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.050\nthere will be cued three square words:\nlike, not and head.\n\n00:14:08.074 --> 00:14:10.228\nHe doesn't know what's coming.\nComputer: Like.\n\n00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:12.022\nFreestyler: I'm like some kind of\n\n00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:14.275\nextraterrestrial, celestial scene\n\n00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:17.136\nBack in the days, I used to sit\nin pyramids and

"https://www.ted.com/talks/deborah_rhodes", "transcript": "There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography \u2014 women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. Do you know which group you're in? If you don't, you're not alone. Because the breast has become a very political organ. The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies. I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth. But first, my disclosures. I am not a breast cancer survivor. I'm not a radiologist. I don't have any patents, and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company, and I am not seeking your vote.(Laughter)What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question. She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s. She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be. Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign. But she asked me a question: how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one? So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin.You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s. Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force, even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies. It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage. Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines. The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. The radiologists were, in turn, criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest. But in my view, the radiologists are heroes. There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms, and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret, and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. But that very fact is telling.Where there is this much legal smoke, there is likely to be some fire. The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density. Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat \u2014 pictured here in yellow \u2014 versus connective and epithelial tissues \u2014 pictured in pink. And that proportion is primarily genetically determined. Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause.So how do you know if your breasts are dense? Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report. Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. If the breast is less than 25 percent dense, that's called fatty-replaced. The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities, followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense. And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense. The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram, and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two. So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast. But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. That's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer, but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer. It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer. At the time my patient posed this question to me, breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature, and very few women having mammograms, or the physicians ordering them, knew about this. But what else could I offer her?Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little. There have been surprisingly few innovations, until digital mammography was approved in 2000. Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera. The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment? In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women. But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent. So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind.What about ultrasound? Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used. And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive. If we think about disruptive technology, we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive. Think about iPods compared to stereos. But it's the exact opposite in health care. The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive. Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer. It's just way too much equipment. One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs. And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price.Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius. Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. It's like the essence of TED. He quotes one innovator who says, \"The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick.\" (Laughter) This makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions. And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems. Now, take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article, and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers.(Laughter)So if you will allow me a little creative license, I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution. Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with. And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast. But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density. But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival. If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases. But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it. It's made not of a bulky tube, but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector. And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density, and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors.So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI. This is an image from our first patient. And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise. But using our new detector, we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape. To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system. This is our current detector. And you can see that it looks a lot different. The duct tape is gone, and we added a second detector on top of the breast, which has further improved our tumor detection.So how does this work? The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells, but not by normal cells, and this is the key difference from mammography. Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density. After the injection, the patient's breast is placed between the detectors. And if you've ever had a mammogram \u2014 if you're old enough to have had a mammogram \u2014 you know what comes next: pain. You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression. (Applause) And the detector then transmits the image to the computer.So here's an example. You can see, on the right, a mammogram showing a faint tumor, the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue. But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor, we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors \u2014 one is small as three millimeters.Our big break came in 2004. After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors, we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts, comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI. Of the tumors that we found, mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors. MBI found 83 percent. Here's an example from that screening study. The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue, but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake, which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor. In this case, a one-centimeter tumor. And in this case, a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo, who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young, wanted to enroll in our study. And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue, but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake, which we can also see on a color image. And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball. But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes.So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem. We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose, and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram. And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. So this is not just young women that it's benefiting. It's also older women with dense tissue. And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology.MBI generates four images per breast. MRI generates over a thousand. It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding. But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image. But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive \u2014 it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost. But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo.After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals. After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology. (Applause) We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose, and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions, and this could take five or more years. If this technology is widely adopted, I will not benefit financially in any way, and that is very important to me, because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth. But I recognize \u2014 (Applause) I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science.The MBI unit has now been FDA approved, but it's not yet widely available. So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself. First, know your density. Ninety percent of women don't, and 95 percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk. The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram. I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is. Of course we should. And if you don't know, please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report. Second, if you're pre-menopausal, try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle, when breast density is relatively lower. Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging. And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive. So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim. It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations. We need to individualize screening based on density. For women without dense breasts, mammography is the best choice. But for women with dense breasts; we shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better.The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school, and the answer has been so slow to come. She's given me her blessing to share this story with you. After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer, she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy. We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1047, "subtitle":

coin.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nYou may recall a year ago\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhen a firestorm erupted\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nafter the United States Preventive Services Task Force\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nreviewed the world's mammography screening literature\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand issued a guideline\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nrecommending against screening mammograms\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nin women in their 40s.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNow everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\neven though most of them weren't in anyway familiar\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwith the mammography studies.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nIt took the Senate just 17 days\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nto ban the use of the guidelines\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nin determining insurance coverage.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nRadiologists were outraged\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nby the guidelines.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThe pre-eminent mammographer in the United States\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nissued the following quote\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nto the Washington Post.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nThe radiologists were, in turn, criticized\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nfor protecting their own financial self-interest.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nBut in my view,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthe radiologists are heroes.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThere's a shortage of radiologists\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nqualified to read mammograms,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nand that's because mammograms are one of the most complex\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nof all radiology studies to interpret,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand because radiologists\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nare sued more often\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nover missed breast cancer\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthan any other cause.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBut that very fact is telling.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWhere there is this much legal smoke,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthere is likely to be some fire.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThe factor most responsible for that fire\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nis breast density.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBreast density refers to the relative amount of fat --\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\npictured here in yellow --\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nversus connective and epithelial tissues --\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\npictured in pink.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd that proportion\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nis primarily genetically determined.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nTwo-thirds of women in their 40s\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nhave dense breast tissue,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhich is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd although breast density generally declines with age,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nup to a third of women\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nretain dense breast tissue\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nfor years after menopause.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo how do you know if your breasts are dense?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nWell, you need to read the details\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nof your mammography report.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nRadiologists classify breast density\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ninto four categories\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nbased on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nIf the breast is less than 25 percent dense,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat's called fatty-replaced.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThe next category\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nis scattered fibroglandular densities,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nfollowed by heterogeneously dense\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand extremely dense.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd breasts that fall into these two categories\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nare considered dense.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nThe problem with breast density\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nis that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBoth tumors and dense breast tissue\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nappear white on a mammogram,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo it's easy to see this tumor\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin the upper part of this fatty breast.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nBut imagine how difficult it would be\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nto find that tumor in this dense breast.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThat's why mammograms find\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nover 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nbut as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nNow it's bad enough that breast density\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nmakes it hard to find a cancer,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nbut it turns out\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat it's also a powerful predictor\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nof your risk for breast cancer.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nIt's a stronger risk factor\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthan having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAt the time my patient posed this question to me,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nbreast density was an obscure topic\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nin the radiology literature,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand very few women having mammograms,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nor the physicians ordering them,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nknew about this.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBut what else could I offer her?\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nMammograms have been around since the 1960's,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand it's changed very little.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThere have been surprisingly few innovations,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nuntil digital mammography was approved\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nin 2000.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nDigital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nbut the images\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\ncan be stored and manipulated digitally,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\njust like we can with a digital camera.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThe U.S. has invested\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nfour billion dollars\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nconverting to digital mammography equipment,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand what have we gained from that investment?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nIn a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\ndigital mammography was found\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nto be no better over all\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthan traditional mammography,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand in fact, it was worse in older women.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nBut it was better in one group,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nand that was women under 50\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwho were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand in those women,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\ndigital mammography found twice as many cancers,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nbut it still only found 60 percent.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo digital mammography\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nhas been a giant leap forward\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nfor manufacturers\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nof digital mammography equipment,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut it's been a very small step forward for\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwomankind.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWhat about ultrasound?\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nUltrasound generates more biopsies\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat are unnecessary relative to other technologies,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nso it's not widely used.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nbut it's also very expensive.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nIf we think about disruptive technology,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nwe see an almost ubiquitous pattern\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nof the technology getting smaller and less expensive.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThink about iPods compared to stereos.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBut it's the exact opposite in health care.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe machines get ever bigger\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand ever more expensive.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nScreening the average young woman with an MRI\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nIt's just way too much equipment.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nOne MRI scan\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\ncosts 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat health care innovation\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\ncan't always come at a much higher price.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nMalcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\non innovation,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand he made the case that scientific discoveries\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nare rarely the product of one individual's genius.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nRather, big ideas can be orchestrated,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nif you can simply gather\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\npeople with different perspectives in a room\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand get them to talk about things\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nthat they don't ordinarily talk about.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nIt's like the essence of TED.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nHe quotes one innovator who says,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\n\"The only time a physician and a physicist get together\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nis when the physicist gets sick.\"\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThis makes no sense,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbecause physicians have all kinds of problems\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthat they don't realize have solutions.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd physicists have all kinds of solutions for things\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nthat they don't realize are problems.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nNow, take a look at this cartoon\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat accompanied Gladwell's article,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand tell me if you see something disturbing\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nabout this depiction of innovative thinkers.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nSo if you will allow me a little creative license,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nI will tell you the story\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nof the serendipitous collision\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nof my patient's problem\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nwith a physicist's solution.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nShortly after her visit,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI was introduced to a nuclear physicist\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nat Mayo\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nnamed Michael O'Conner,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwho was a specialist in cardiac imaging,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nsomething I had nothing to do with.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd he happened to tell me\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nabout a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nwhere they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nNow gamma imaging has been around for a long time\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto image the heart,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand it had even been tried to image the breast.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nBut the problem was\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat the gamma detectors\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwere these huge, bulky tubes,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand they were filled with these scintillating crystals,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nto find small tumors.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nBut the potential advantage was\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthat gamma rays, unlike X-rays,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nare not influenced by breast density.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nBut this technology\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\ncould not find tumors when they're small,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand finding a small tumor is critical for survival.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nIf you can find a tumor\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhen it's less than a centimeter,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nsurvival exceeds 90 percent,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nbut drops off rapidly\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nas tumor size increases.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nBut Michael told me about\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\na new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand this is it.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nIt's made\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nnot of a bulky tube,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nbut of a thin layer of a semiconductor material\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat serves as the gamma detector.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd I started talking to him\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nabout this problem with breast density,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand we realized that we might be able to get this detector\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nclose enough around the breast\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nto actually find small tumors.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo after putting together\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\na grid of these cubes with tape --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\n-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nof a mammography machine\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat was about to be thrown out,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand we attached the new detector,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand we decided to call this machine\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nMolecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThis is an image from our first patient.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd you can see, using the old gamma technology,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat it just looked like noise.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nBut using our new detector,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwe could begin to see the outline of a tumor.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nSo here we were, a nuclear physicist,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nan internist,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nsoon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand two radiologists,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand we were trying to take on\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthe entrenched world of mammography\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nwith a machine that was held together by duct tape.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nTo say that we faced\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nhigh doses of skepticism\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nin those early years\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nis just a huge understatement,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nbut we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthat we chipped away with incremental modifications\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nto this system.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThis is our current detector.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd you can see that it looks a lot different.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThe duct tape is gone,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand we added a second detector on top of the breast,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwhich has further improved our tumor detection.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nSo how does this work?\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nThe patient receives an injection of a radio tracer\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthat's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nbut not by normal cells,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand this is the key difference from mammography.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nMammography relies on differences\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nin the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand we've seen that those differences\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\ncan be obscured in a dense breast.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nBut MBI exploits\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthe different molecular behavior of tumors,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand therefore, it's impervious to breast density.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAfter the injection,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nthe patient's breast is placed between the detectors.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd if you've ever had a mammogram --\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nif you're old enough to have had a mammogram --\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nyou know what comes next:\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\npain.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nYou may be surprised to know\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nthat mammography is the only radiologic study\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthat's regulated by federal law,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nand the law requires\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nthat the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\ncome down on your breast during this study.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nBut with MBI,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nwe use just light, pain-free compression.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:59.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd the detector\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthen transmits the image to the computer.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nSo here's an example.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nYou can see, on the right, a mammogram\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nshowing a faint tumor,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthe edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nas well as a second tumor,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nwhich profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nIn this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwe were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\none is small as three millimeters.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nOur big break came in 2004.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAfter we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwe used these images\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nto submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAnd we were elated when they took a chance\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\non a team of completely unknown investigators\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nand funded us to study\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n1,000 women with dense breasts,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\ncomparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nOf the tumors that we found,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nmammography found\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nonly 25 percent of those tumors.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nMBI found 83 percent.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nHere's an example from that screening study.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThe digital mammogram was read as normal\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand shows lots of dense tissue,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbut the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhich correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nIn this case, a one-centimeter tumor.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nAnd in this case,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\na 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nwho had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwanted to enroll in our study.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nbut her MBI showed an area\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nof worrisome uptake,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwhich we can also see on a color image.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAnd this corresponded\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nto a tumor the size of a golf ball.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nBut fortunately it was removed\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nbefore it had spread to her lymph nodes.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nSo now that we knew that this technology\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\ncould find three times more tumors in a dense breast,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe had to solve one very important problem.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nand we have spent the last three years\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nmaking modifications to every aspect of the imaging system\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nto allow this.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthat is equivalent to the effective dose\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nfrom one digital mammogram.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand this image from three weeks ago\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin a 67-year-old woman\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nshows a normal digital mammogram,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nbut an MBI image\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nshowing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nSo this is not just young women that it's benefiting.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nIt's also older women with dense tissue.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nAnd we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nthat's used in any other type of gamma technology.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nMBI generates four images per breast.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nMRI generates over a thousand.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nIt takes a radiologist\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nyears of specialty training\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nto become expert in differentiating\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nthe normal anatomic detail\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nfrom the worrisome finding.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nBut I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\ncan find the tumor on the MBI image.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nBut this is why MBI\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nis so potentially disruptive --\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nit's as accurate as MRI,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nit's far less complex to interpret,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand it's a fraction of the cost.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nBut you can understand why there may be\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nforces in the breast-imaging world\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nwho prefer the status quo.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAfter achieving what we felt were remarkable results,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nour manuscript was rejected\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nby four journals.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAfter the fourth rejection,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nwe requested reconsideration of the manuscript,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbecause we strongly suspected\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nthat one of the reviewers who had rejected it\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nhad a financial conflict of interest\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nin a competing technology.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nOur manuscript was then accepted\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nand will be published later this month\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nin the journal Radiology.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:17:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nWe still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand then our findings will need to be replicated\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nat other institutions,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand this could take five or more years.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nIf this technology is widely adopted,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nI will not benefit financially in any way,\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand that is very important to me,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nbecause it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nBut I recognize --\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nI recognize that the adoption of this technology\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nwill depend as much on economic\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nand political forces\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nas it will on the soundness of the science.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThe MBI unit has now been FDA approved,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nbut it's not yet widely available.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nSo until something is available\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nfor women with dense breasts,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nthere are things that you should know\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nto protect yourself.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nFirst, know your density.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nNinety percent of women don't,\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nand 95 percent of women don't know\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nthat it increases your breast cancer risk.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nThe State of Connecticut became the first and only state\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nto mandate that women receive notification\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nof their breast density\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nafter a mammogram.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nI was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nlast week in Chicago,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nand I was stunned that there was a heated debate\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nas to whether we should be telling women\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nwhat their breast density is.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nOf course we should.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd if you don't know, please ask your doctor\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nor read the details of your mammography report.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nSecond, if you're pre-menopausal,\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\ntry to schedule your mammogram\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nin the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nwhen breast density is relatively lower.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nThird, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\ninsist on additional imaging.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nAnd fourth and most important,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthe mammography debate will rage on,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nbut I do believe that all women 40 and older\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nshould have an annual mammogram.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nMammography isn't perfect,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nbut it's the only test that's been proven\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nto reduce mortality from breast cancer.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nBut this mortality banner\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nis the very sword\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nwhich mammography's most ardent advocates use\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nto deter innovation.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nSome women who develop breast cancer\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.958\ndie from it many years later,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nand most women, thankfully, survive.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nSo it takes 10 or more years\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nfor any screening method\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nto demonstrate a reduction\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nin mortality from breast cancer.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nMammography's the only one that's been around long enough\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nto have a chance of making that claim.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nIt is time for us to accept\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nboth the extraordinary successes of mammography\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nand the limitations.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nWe need to individualize screening\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nbased on density.\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nFor women without dense breasts,\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nmammography is the best choice.\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nBut for women with dense breasts;\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nwe shouldn't abandon screening altogether,\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nwe need to offer them something better.\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nThe babies that we were carrying\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nwhen my patient first asked me this question\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nare now both in middle school,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nand the answer has been so slow to come.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nShe's given me her blessing\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nto share this story with you.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nAfter undergoing biopsies\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nthat further increased her risk for cancer\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nand losing her sister to cancer,\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nshe made the difficult decision\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nto have a prophylactic mastectomy.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nWe can and must do better,\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nnot just in time for her granddaughters\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nand my daughters,\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nbut in time for you.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nThank you.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:58.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The 3 A's of awesome", "duration": "1053", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_pasricha_the_3_a_s_of_awesome", "transcript": "So the Awesome story: It begins about 40 years ago, when my mom and my dad came to Canada. My mom left Nairobi, Kenya. My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India. And they got here in the late 1960s. They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto, and they settled into a new life. They saw their first dentist, they ate their first hamburger, and they had their first kids. My sister and I grew up here, and we had quiet, happy childhoods. We had close family, good friends, a quiet street. We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up \u2014 things like power always on in our houses, things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard. We grew up, and we grew older. I went to high school. I graduated. I moved out of the house, I got a job, I found a girl, I settled down \u2014 and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song \u2014(Laughter)but life was pretty good. Life was pretty good. 2006 was a great year. Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario, I got married, surrounded by 150 family and friends. 2007 was a great year. I graduated from school, and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. We actually saw seals out of our car window, and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads. (Laughter) So you can't actually see them, but it was breathtaking, believe me.(Laughter)2008 and 2009 were a little tougher. I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. First of all, the news was so heavy. It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that, but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV, it was about ice caps melting, wars going on around the world, earthquakes, hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse, and then eventually did collapse, and so many of us losing our homes, or our jobs, or our retirements, or our livelihoods. 2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too. I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. My marriage wasn't going well, and we just were growing further and further apart. One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears, to have a very honest conversation. And she said, \"I don't love you anymore,\" and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard, until only a month later, when I heard something even more heartbreaking.My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of, had been battling mental illness for some time. And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness, you know how challenging it can be. I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night. We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared. Very sadly, he took his own life. And it was a really heavy time.And as these dark clouds were circling me, and I was finding it really, really difficult to think of anything good, I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow. So I came home from work one night, and I logged onto the computer, and I started up a tiny website called 1000awesomethings.com. I was trying to remind myself of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love, but we just don't talk about enough \u2014 things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking, being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding, wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer, or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line \u2014 even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.(Laughter)And slowly over time, I started putting myself in a better mood. I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000. And nobody read it except for my mom. Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad. (Laughter) And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions. It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And then I got a phone call, and the voice at the other end of the line said, \"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.\" I was like, that sounds totally fake. (Laughter) (Applause) Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to? (Laughter) But it turns out, I jumped on a plane, and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog. And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto, when, in my inbox, 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. Flash-forward to the next year and \"The Book of Awesome\" has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.(Applause)But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today. I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story, I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome, and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. So let's talk about those three As. Over the last few years, I haven't had that much time to really think. But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself: \"What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website, but also grow myself?\" And I've summarized those things, for me personally, as three As. They are Attitude, Awareness and Authenticity. I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.So Attitude: Look, we're all going to get lumps, and we're all going to get bumps. None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan. We will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages, father-daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room, but between those high highs, we may also have some lumps and some bumps too. It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about, but your husband might leave you, your girlfriend could cheat, your headaches might be more serious than you thought, or your dog could get hit by a car on the street. It's not a happy thought, but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. Your mom could get cancer, your dad could get mean. And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well, too, with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart, and when that bad news washes over you, and when that pain sponges and soaks in, I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. One, you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever, or two, you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes. Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two, and choosing, no matter how difficult it is, no matter what pain hits you, choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future.The second \"A\" is Awareness. I love hanging out with three year-olds. I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk. I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand, soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner. I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old. Because you all used to be three years old. That three-year-old boy is still part of you. That three-year-old girl is still part of you. They're in there. And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once, too. So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work. There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air, or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said, \"Found money.\"The last \"A\" is Authenticity. And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story. Let's go all the way back to 1932 when, on a peanut farm in Georgia, a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born. Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him, grew up and grew into a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL. He's number 76 in the picture. Here he is pictured with the \"fearsome foursome.\" These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against. They were tough football players doing what they love, which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field. But Rosey Grier also had another passion. In his deeply authentic self, he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter) He loved knitting. He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him, it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks. That's what he said. I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL, he started joining clubs. And he even put out a book called \"Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.\" (Laughter) (Applause) It's a great cover. If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.(Laughter)And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person, and that's what authenticity is all about. It's just about being you and being cool with that. And I think when you're authentic, you end up following your heart, and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy. You meet people that you like talking to. You go places you've dreamt about. And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled. So those are the three A's.For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada. I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s. I don't know, because I never did it, but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude. I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. And I think you'd have to be really authentic, you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to.I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about 10 seconds right now, because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this, and my parents are sitting in the front row. So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up. And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.(Applause)When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. And it's a great story, because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport, and he was welcomed by a non-profit group, which I'm sure someone in this room runs. (Laughter) And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles, there was olives, those little white onions. There was rolled up turkey cold cuts, rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese. There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches. There was lasagna, there was casseroles, there was brownies, there was butter tarts, and there was pies, lots and lots of pies. And when my dad tells the story, he says, \"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread. (Laughter) I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian. I was eating olives with pie. (Laughter) I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here.\"(Laughter)When I was five years old, my dad used to take me grocery shopping, and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. He would say, \"Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico? They've got an apple here from South Africa. Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?\" He's like, \"Do you know where Morocco even is?\" And I'd say, \"I'm five. I don't even know where I am. Is this A&P?\" And he'd say, \"I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out.\" And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home. And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf, and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country. And when we did, my dad would say, \"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house, so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?\" And I'd say, \"I don't believe that.\" And he's like, \"I don't believe it either. Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about.\"When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right. There are so many things to be happy about. We are the only species on the only life-giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen, capable of experiencing so many of these things. I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy. We've got airplanes, highway lanes, interior design and horoscope signs. We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes. You can watch a horror movie with monsters. You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming. We've got books, buffets and radio waves, wedding brides and rollercoaster rides. You can sleep in clean sheets. You can go to the movies and get good seats. You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair, pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.We've got all that, but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it. And that's the sad part. The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet. And that moment is right now, and those moments are counting down, and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.You will never be as young as you are right now. And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude, choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow, living with a sense of awareness of the world around you, embracing your inner three year-old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself, being you and being cool with that, letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you, then I think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying, and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.Thank you.", "id": 1048, "subtitle":

me.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nI know that they were tougher for a lot of people,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nnot just me.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nFirst of all, the news was so heavy.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIt's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nbut when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nit was about ice caps melting,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nwars going on around the world,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nearthquakes, hurricanes\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand then eventually did collapse,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand so many of us losing our homes,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nor our jobs,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nor our retirements,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nor our livelihoods.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nI was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nMy marriage wasn't going well,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand we just were growing further and further apart.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nOne day my wife came home from work\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nto have a very honest conversation.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd she said, \"I don't love you anymore,\"\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nuntil only a month later,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwhen I heard something even more heartbreaking.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nMy friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nhad been battling mental illness for some time.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd for those of you\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nwhose lives have been touched by mental illness,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nyou know how challenging it can be.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\non a Sunday night.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nWe talked about the TV show we watched that evening.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nVery sadly, he took his own life.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd it was a really heavy time.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAnd as these dark clouds were circling me,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nand I was finding it really, really difficult\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nto think of anything good,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nI said to myself that I really needed a way\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nto focus on the positive somehow.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo I came home from work one night,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand I logged onto the computer,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand I started up a tiny website\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ncalled 1000awesomethings.com.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI was trying to remind myself\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nof the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nbut we just don't talk about enough --\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthings like waiters and waitresses\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwho bring you free refills without asking,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nbeing the first table to get called up\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto the dinner buffet at a wedding,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nor when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand you get to be first in line --\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\neven if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd slowly over time,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nI started putting myself in a better mood.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nI mean, 50,000 blogs\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nare started a day,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand so my blog was just one of those 50,000.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd nobody read it except for my mom.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAlthough I should say that my traffic did skyrocket\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand go up by 100 percent\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwhen she forwarded it to my dad.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd then I got excited\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nwhen it started getting tens of hits,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nand then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand then hundreds and then thousands\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand then millions.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd then I got a phone call,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand the voice at the other end of the line said,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\n\"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.\"\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nI was like, that sounds totally fake.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWhich African country do you want me to wire all my money to?\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nBut it turns out, I jumped on a plane,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand I ended up walking a red carpet\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbetween Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd the surprise\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand just the amazement of that\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwas only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhen, in my inbox,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\n10 literary agents were waiting for me\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto talk about putting this into a book.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nFlash-forward to the next year\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand \"The Book of Awesome\" has now been\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nnumber one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:17.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nI said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nSo let's talk about those three As.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nOver the last few years,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nI haven't had that much time to really think.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBut lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand ask myself: \"What is it over the last few years\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat helped me grow my website,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nbut also grow myself?\"\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd I've summarized those things, for me personally,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nas three As.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThey are Attitude, Awareness\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand Authenticity.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nI'd love to just talk about each one briefly.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo Attitude:\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nLook, we're all going to get lumps,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand we're all going to get bumps.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nNone of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe will all have high highs\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand big days and proud moments\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof smiles on graduation stages,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nfather-daughter dances at weddings\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nbut between those high highs,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwe may also have some lumps and some bumps too.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIt's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbut your husband might leave you,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nyour girlfriend could cheat,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nyour headaches might be more serious than you thought,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nor your dog could get hit by a car on the street.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nIt's not a happy thought,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nbut your kids could get mixed up in gangs\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nor bad scenes.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nYour mom could get cancer,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nyour dad could get mean.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd there are times in life\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwhen you will be tossed in the well, too,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwith twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand when that bad news washes over you,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand when that pain sponges and soaks in,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nI just really hope you feel\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nlike you've always got two choices.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nOne, you can swirl and twirl\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand gloom and doom forever,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nor two, you can grieve\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand then face the future\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nwith newly sober eyes.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nHaving a great attitude is about choosing option number two,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand choosing, no matter how difficult it is,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nno matter what pain hits you,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nchoosing to move forward and move on\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand take baby steps into the future.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThe second \"A\" is Awareness.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nI love hanging out with three year-olds.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nI love the way that they see the world,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbecause they're seeing the world for the first time.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nI love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nI love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nat their first baseball game\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwith wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nsoaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nand the smell of the hotdogs.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nI love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand putting them into a nice centerpiece\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nfor Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nI love the way that they see the world,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nbecause they're seeing the world\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nfor the first time.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nHaving a sense of awareness\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nis just about embracing your inner three year-old.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nBecause you all used to be three years old.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThat three-year-old boy is still part of you.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThat three-year-old girl is still part of you.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThey're in there.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd being aware is just about remembering\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat you saw everything you've seen\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nfor the first time once, too.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nSo there was a time when it was your first time ever\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nhitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThere was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand smelt the bakery air,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nor the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand said, \"Found money.\"\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nThe last \"A\" is Authenticity.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nLet's go all the way back to 1932\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhen, on a peanut farm in Georgia,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\na little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nRoosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\ngrew up and grew into\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\na 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nHe's number 76 in the picture.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nHere he is pictured with the \"fearsome foursome.\"\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThese were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nyou did not want to go up against.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThey were tough football players doing what they love,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwhich was crushing skulls\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand separating shoulders on the football field.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nBut Rosey Grier also had\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nanother passion.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nIn his deeply authentic self,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nhe also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nHe loved knitting.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nHe said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nit took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThat's what he said.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nI mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nhe started joining clubs.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd he even put out a book\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\ncalled \"Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.\"\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nIt's a great cover.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nIf you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd so what I love about this story\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nis that Rosey Grier\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nis just such an authentic person,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand that's what authenticity is all about.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nIt's just about being you and being cool with that.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd I think when you're authentic,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nyou end up following your heart,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nand you put yourself in places\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand situations and in conversations\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthat you love and that you enjoy.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nYou meet people that you like talking to.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nYou go places you've dreamt about.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd you end you end up following your heart\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand feeling very fulfilled.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nSo those are the three A's.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nFor the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nto my parents coming to Canada.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nI don't know what it would feel like\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ncoming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nI don't know, because I never did it,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nbut I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nI would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand appreciating the small wonders\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat you're starting to see in your new world.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd I think you'd have to be really authentic,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nyou'd have to be really true to yourself\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nin order to get through what you're being exposed to.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nI'd like to pause my TEDTalk\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nfor about 10 seconds right now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nbecause you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand my parents are sitting in the front row.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nSo I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nWhen I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nof his first day in Canada.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd it's a great story, because what happened was\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhe got off the plane at the Toronto airport,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nand he was welcomed by a non-profit group,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwhich I'm sure someone in this room runs.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfor all the new immigrants to Canada.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nAnd my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nand there was this huge spread.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThere was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthere was olives, those little white onions.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThere was rolled up turkey cold cuts,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nrolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand little cubes of cheese.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nThere was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand salmon salad sandwiches.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThere was lasagna, there was casseroles,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nthere was brownies, there was butter tarts,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nand there was pies, lots and lots of pies.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd when my dad tells the story, he says,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.958\n\"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nI didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nI was eating olives with pie.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nI just couldn't believe how many things you can get here.\"\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nWhen I was five years old,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nmy dad used to take me grocery shopping,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand he would stare in wonder\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nat the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nHe would say, \"Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThey've got an apple here from South Africa.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nCan you believe they've got a date from Morocco?\"\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nHe's like, \"Do you know where Morocco even is?\"\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd I'd say, \"I'm five. I don't even know where I am.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nIs this A&amp;P?\"\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd he'd say, \"I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out.\"\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAnd so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd when we did, my dad would say,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\n\"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\npicked this thing off it, put it in a truck,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\ndrove it all the way to the docks\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand then sailed it all the way\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nacross the Atlantic Ocean\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand then put it in another truck\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nso they could sell it to us for 25 cents?\"\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd I'd say, \"I don't believe that.\"\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd he's like, \"I don't believe it either.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nThings are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about.\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nWhen I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nThere are so many things to be happy about.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe are the only species\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\non the only life-giving rock\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nin the entire universe that we've ever seen,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\ncapable of experiencing\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nso many of these things.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nWe're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nWe've got airplanes, highway lanes,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\ninterior design and horoscope signs.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nWe've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nYou can watch a horror movie with monsters.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nYou can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWe've got books, buffets and radio waves,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwedding brides and rollercoaster rides.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nYou can sleep in clean sheets.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nYou can go to the movies and get good seats.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nYou can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\npop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nWe've got all that,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nbut we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nAnd that's the sad part.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nThe cashiers at your grocery store,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthe foreman at your plant,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthe guy tailgating you home on the highway,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthe telemarketer calling you during dinner,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nevery teacher you've ever had,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\neveryone that's ever woken up beside you,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nevery politician in every country,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nevery actor in every movie,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nevery single person in your family, everyone you love,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\neveryone in this room and you\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nwill be dead in a hundred years.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nLife is so great that we only get such a short time\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nto experience and enjoy\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nall those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd that moment is right now,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nand those moments are counting down,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nand those moments are always, always, always fleeting.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nYou will never be as young as you are right now.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd that's why I believe that if you live your life\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nwith a great attitude,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nchoosing to move forward and move on\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nwhenever life deals you a blow,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nliving with a sense of awareness of the world around you,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nembracing your inner three year-old\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nand seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nand being authentic to yourself,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nbeing you and being cool with that,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nletting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nthen I think you'll live a life\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nthat is rich and is satisfying,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "A realistic vision for world peace", "duration": "652", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jody_williams_a_realistic_vision_for_world_peace", "transcript": "I'm actually here to make a challenge to people. I know there have been many challenges made to people. The one I'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means. Peace is not \"Kumbaya, my Lord.\" Peace is not the dove and the rainbow \u2014 as lovely as they are. When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove, I think of personal serenity. I think of meditation. I do not think about what I consider to be peace, which is sustainable peace with justice and equality. It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives, where these people have enough access to education and health care, so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear. This is called human security. And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really, really heavy-duty, non-violent friends, like Mairead McGuire. I understand that humans are so \"messed up\" \u2014 to use a nice word, because I promised my mom I'd stop using the F-bomb in public. And I'm trying harder and harder. Mom, I'm really trying.We need a little bit of police; we need a little bit of military, but for defense. We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world. It is not arming our country to the teeth. It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them. It is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure, to make the people of the world secure. I was thinking about the recent ongoings in Congress, where the president is offering 8.4 billion dollars to try to get the START vote. I certainly support the START vote. But he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons. Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is 80 billion dollars? Just that little bit of money, which to me, I wish it was in my bank account \u2014 it's not, but ... In global terms, it's a little bit of money. But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime, unless we get up off our ... and take action to make it happen, unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security. It is saving the tigers. It is stopping the tar sands. It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer. It is all of those things. It is using our money for all of those things. It is about action.I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago, and His Holiness \u2014 we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city, and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates. And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church. We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak, and he leans over to me, and he says, \"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk.\" I said, \"Yes, Your Holiness. Your robe gives it away.\" (Laughter) He said, \"You know that I kind of like meditation, and I pray.\" I said, \"That's good. That's good. We need that in the world. I don't follow that, but that's cool.\" And he says, \"But I have become skeptical. I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. I think what we need is action.\" His Holiness, in his robes, is my new action hero.I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago. As most of you know, she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma. You probably also know that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy. She was just released a couple of weeks ago, and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free, because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon, agitating for change. She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it. But I talked to her for a range of issues. But one thing that I want to say, because it's similar to what His Holiness said. She said, \"You know, we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country. But I don't believe in hope without endeavor. I don't believe in the hope of change, unless we take action to make it so.\"Here's another woman hero of mine. She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been in exile for the last year and a half. You ask her where she lives \u2014 where does she live in exile? She says the airports of the world. She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections. And instead of going home, she conferred with all the other women that she works with, who said to her, \"Stay out. We need you out. We need to be able to talk to you out there, so that you can give the message of what's happening here.\" A year and a half \u2014 she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country.Wangari Maathai \u2014 2004 Peace laureate. They call her the \"Tree Lady,\" but she's more than the Tree Lady. Working for peace is very creative. It's hard work every day. When she was planting those trees, I don't think most people understand that, at the same time, she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country. People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail. But if they were together planting trees for the environment, it was okay \u2014 creativity. But it's not just iconic women like Shirin, like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai \u2014 it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world.The Women's League of Burma, 11 individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers. Working together is what changes our world. The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights, to bring democracy to that country. When one is arrested and taken to prison, another one comes out and joins the movement, recognizing that if they work together, they will ultimately bring change in their own country.Mairead McGuire in the middle, Betty Williams on the right-hand side \u2014 bringing peace to Northern Ireland. I'll tell you the quick story. An IRA driver was shot, and his car plowed into people on the side of the street. There was a mother and three children. The children were killed on the spot. It was Mairead's sister. Instead of giving in to grief, depression, defeat in the face of that violence, Mairead hooked up with Betty \u2014 a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic \u2014 and they took to the streets to say, \"No more violence.\" And they were able to get tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men, in the streets to bring about change. And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland, and they're still working on it, because there's still a lot more to do.This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum. She also received the Peace Prize. She is now running for president. She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy, about how you bring democracy to the country, about educating, about how to vote \u2014 but that democracy is not just about voting; it's about being an active citizen.That's what I got stuck doing \u2014 the landmine campaign. One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in 90 countries around the world, working together in common cause to ban landmines. Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month. They could maybe volunteer that much. There were others, like myself, who were full-time. But it was the actions, together, of all of us that brought about that change.In my view, what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace. It's not a dirty word. It's hard work every single day. And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could, we would change this world, we would save this world. And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1049, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm actually here\n\n00:00:13.958

Ireland.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nI'll tell you the quick story.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAn IRA driver was shot,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand his car plowed into people\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\non the side of the street.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThere was a mother and three children.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThe children were killed on the spot.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nIt was Mairead's sister.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nInstead of giving in\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nto grief, depression, defeat\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nin the face of that violence,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nMairead hooked up with Betty --\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\na staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand they took to the streets\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nto say, \"No more violence.\"\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd they were able to get\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\ntens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nin the streets to bring about change.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd they have been\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\npart of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand they're still working on it,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nbecause there's still a lot more to do.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThis is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nShe also received the Peace Prize.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nShe is now running for president.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nShe is educating the indigenous people of her country\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nabout what it means to be a democracy,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nabout how you bring democracy to the country,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nabout educating, about how to vote --\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nbut that democracy is not just about voting;\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nit's about being an active citizen.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThat's what I got stuck doing --\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthe landmine campaign.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nOne of the things that made this campaign work\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nis because we grew from two NGOs\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nto thousands\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nin 90 countries around the world,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nworking together in common cause to ban landmines.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSome of the people who worked in our campaign\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ncould only work maybe an hour a month.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThey could maybe volunteer that much.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThere were others, like myself,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nwho were full-time.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nBut it was the actions, together, of all of us\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthat brought about that change.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIn my view, what we need today\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nis people getting up\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand taking action\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nto reclaim the meaning of peace.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt's not a dirty word.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nIt's hard work every single day.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd if each of us\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nwho cares about the different things we care about\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\ngot up off our butts\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand volunteered\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nas much time as we could,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwe would change this world,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwe would save this world.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "We are all cyborgs now", "duration": "473", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/amber_case_we_are_all_cyborgs_now", "transcript": "I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs, but not the cyborgs that you think. You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg? Well, traditional definition is \"an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments.\" That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next.So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. Somebody goes to another country, says, \"How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is.\" And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think it's very exotic. Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, \"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures, and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. They're clicking on things and staring at screens.\"Now there's a reason why I study this, versus traditional anthropology. And the reason is that tool use, in the beginning \u2014 for thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self. It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that. But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently. And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out. What does the inside of your computer actually look like? Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open, which is basically your Facebook wall, so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night \u2014 because it's very much the equivalent. And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward, and then they go through their second self's adolescence, and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now, and so it's very awkward, and it's very difficult for them to do those things.So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, \"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.\" And I said, \"Great.\" And he said one day, \"What's the shortest distance between two points?\" And I said, \"Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.\" I thought I was very clever. He said, \"No, no, no. Here's a better way.\" He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched. And he said, \"That is the shortest distance between two points.\" And I said, \"Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?\" He said, \"Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it.\" And I said, \"I want to do that.\" And he said, \"Well, okay.\" And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, \"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster. And I want to make a time machine.\" I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. So I started studying anthropology. And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones, I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. They weren't physically transporting themselves; they were mentally transporting themselves. They would click on a button, and they would be connected as A to B immediately. And I thought, \"Oh, wow. I found it. This is great.\"So over time, time and space have compressed because of this. You can stand on one side of the world, whisper something and be heard on the other. One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. And because of that, you start to dig around for your external memories \u2014 where did you leave them? So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. And that incites a sort of panic architecture \u2014 \"Oh no, where's this thing?\" We're all \"I Love Lucy\" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up.And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded. These are the people that you have access to right now, in general \u2014 all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore, and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces, paleontology and panic architecture. They're not just sitting there. And really, when you have no external input, that is a time when there is a creation of self, when you can do long-term planning, when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then, once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way, instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in \u2014 and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this. And so this is very important. I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either. It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. But when you actually visualize it, all the connections that we're doing right now \u2014 this is an image of the mapping of the Internet \u2014 it doesn't look technological. It actually looks very organic. This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. And it's not that machines are taking over. It's that they're helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other.The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time. And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection \u2014 it's just done in a different way. We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography. So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1050, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI would like to tell you all\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nthat you are all actually cyborgs,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbut not the cyborgs that you think.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nYou're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nbut you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nor use one of your cell phone devices.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nSo what's a good definition for cyborg?\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nWell, traditional definition is \"an organism\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nto which exogenous components have been added\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nfor the purpose of adapting to new environments.\"\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nThat came from a 1960 paper on space travel,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nbecause, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nPeople aren't supposed to be there.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nBut humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nso they can go to the Alps one day\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand then become a fish in the sea the next.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nSo let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nSomebody goes to another country,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nsays, \"How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nhow curious their culture is.\"\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nand we think it's very exotic.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nWell, what's happening\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nis that we've suddenly found a new species.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nI, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\n\"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nand look at these fascinating cultures,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand look at these curious rituals\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nthat everybody's doing around this technology.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nThey're clicking on things and staring at screens.\"\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nNow there's a reason why I study this,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nversus traditional anthropology.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd the reason is that tool use,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nin the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\neverything has been a physical modification of self.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIt has helped us to extend our physical selves,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\ngo faster, hit things harder,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand there's been a limit on that.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nBut now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nbut an extension of the mental self,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nand because of that, we're able to travel faster,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\ncommunicate differently.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd the other thing that happens\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nis that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nWe can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand then we can take anything out.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat does the inside of your computer actually look like?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWell, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthat you're carrying around all the time.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nAnd if you actually lose that information,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nit means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat you suddenly feel like something's missing,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nexcept you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThe other thing that happens is that you have a second self.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nWhether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand people are interacting with your second self\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwhen you're not there.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd so you have to be careful\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nabout leaving your front lawn open,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwhich is basically your Facebook wall,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nso that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nbecause it's very much the equivalent.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nYou have to present yourself in digital life\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nin a similar way that you would in your analog life.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nSo, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nyou have to learn to do that for your digital self.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd the problem is that a lot of people now,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nespecially adolescents,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nhave to go through two adolescences.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThey have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand then they go through their second self's adolescence,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nand that's even more awkward\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbecause there's an actual history\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nof what they've gone through online.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd anybody coming in new to technology\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nis an adolescent online right now,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand so it's very awkward,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand it's very difficult for them to do those things.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nSo when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n\"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.\"\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd I said, \"Great.\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd he said one day, \"What's the shortest distance between two points?\"\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI thought I was very clever.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nHe said, \"No, no, no. Here's a better way.\"\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nHe took a piece of paper,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\ndrew A and B on one side and the other\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand folded them together so where A and B touched.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd he said, \"That is the shortest distance between two points.\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd I said, \"Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nHe said, \"Well, you just bend time and space,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nit takes an awful lot of energy,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand that's just how you do it.\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd I said, \"I want to do that.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd he said, \"Well, okay.\"\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nI was thinking at night,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n\"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nto make things accelerate faster.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd I want to make a time machine.\"\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nI was always sending messages to my future self\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nusing tape recorders.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nBut then what I realized when I went to college\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nis that technology doesn't just get adopted\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbecause it works.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt gets adopted because people use it\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand it's made for humans.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nSo I started studying anthropology.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nI realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThey weren't physically transporting themselves;\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthey were mentally transporting themselves.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThey would click on a button,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand they would be connected as A to B immediately.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I thought, \"Oh, wow. I found it. This is great.\"\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo over time, time and space\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nhave compressed because of this.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nYou can stand on one side of the world,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwhisper something and be heard on the other.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nOne of the other ideas that comes around\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nis that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nEvery single browser tab gives you a different type of time.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd because of that, you start to dig around\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nfor your external memories -- where did you leave them?\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo now we're all these paleontologists\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat are digging for things that we've lost\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\non our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd that incites a sort of panic architecture --\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n\"Oh no, where's this thing?\"\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nWe're all \"I Love Lucy\" on a great assembly line of information,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand we can't keep up.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd so what happens is,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nwhen we bring all that into the social space,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nwe end up checking our phones all the time.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo we have this thing called ambient intimacy.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIt's not that we're always connected to everybody,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nbut at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nAnd if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nthe room would be very crowded.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThese are the people that you have access to right now, in general --\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nall of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nOne I'm really worried about\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nis that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand that they aren't slowing down and stopping,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nbeing around all those people in the room all the time\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nthat are trying to compete for their attention\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\non the simultaneous time interfaces,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\npaleontology and panic architecture.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThey're not just sitting there.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd really, when you have no external input,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthat is a time when there is a creation of self,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nwhen you can do long-term planning,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwhen you can try and figure out who you really are.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd then, once you do that, you can figure out\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nhow to present your second self in a legitimate way,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\ninstead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nand oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd so this is very important.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nI'm really worried that, especially kids today,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nthey're not going to be dealing with this down-time,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthat they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand that everything comes to them,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nIt has its own external prosthetic devices,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand these devices are helping us all\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto communicate and interact with each other.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nBut when you actually visualize it,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nall the connections that we're doing right now --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthis is an image of the mapping of the Internet --\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nit doesn't look technological.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nIt actually looks very organic.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThis is the first time in the entire history of humanity\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat we've connected in this way.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd it's not that machines are taking over.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt's that they're helping us to be more human,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nhelping us to connect with each other.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThe most successful technology gets out of the way\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand helps us live our lives.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd really,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nit ends up being more human than technology,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nbecause we're co-creating each other all the time.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnd so this is the important point that I like to study:\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nthat things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nit's just done in a different way.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWe're just increasing our humanness\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand our

"transcript": "If we look around us, much of what surrounds us started life as various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world. But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now. They look like TV cameras, monitors, annoying radio mics. And so this magical transformation is what I was trying to get at with my project, which became known as the Toaster Project. And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams, and the situation is from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" And the situation it describes is the hero of the book \u2014 he's a 20th-century man \u2014 finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people. And he kind of assumes that, yes, he'll become \u2014 these villagers \u2014 he'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements, but, of course, realizes that without the rest of human society, he can barely make a sandwich, let alone a toaster. But he didn't have Wikipedia.So I thought, okay, I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. And, working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer, I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find, took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that, inside this object, which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds, there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials. I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. I had maybe nine months. So I thought, okay, I'll start with five. And these were steel, mica, plastic, copper and nickel.So, starting with steel: how do you make steel? I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said, \"How do you make steel?\" And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. And my vague rememberings from GCSE science \u2014 well, steel comes from iron, so I phoned up an iron mine. And said, \"Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster. Can I come up and get some iron?\" Unfortunately, when I got there \u2014 emerges Ray. He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster, and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. But after some nagging, I got him to do that.(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone, and that was produced by sea creatures 350 million years ago in a nice, warm, sunny atmosphere. When you study geology, you can see what's happened in the past, and there were terrific changes in the earth.Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up. And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever. But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train, and then was faced with the problem: Okay, how do you make this rock into components for a toaster?So I went back to Professor Cilliers, and he said, \"Go to the library.\" So I did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy \u2014 completely useless for what I was trying to do. Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant. So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book. This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West, at least. And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower. (Laughter) And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project, was, the smaller the scale you want to work on, the further back in time you have to go. And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron. I dragged out this stuff, and it wasn't iron. But luckily, I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves, and at 30 minutes at full power, and I was able to finish off the process.So, my next \u2014 (Applause) The next thing I was trying to get was copper. Again, this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world. It's not anymore, but I found a retired geology professor to take me down, and he said, \"Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine.\" And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up, dissolving the minerals from the mine. And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto, which is in Portugal. As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it. So many such that it's now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic, toxic conditions. But anyway, the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was \u2014 there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug.So my next thing: I was off to Scotland to get mica. And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity. That's me getting mica. And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic, and, of course, my toaster had to have a plastic case. Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods. And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. But even then they weren't convinced and said, \"Okay, we'll phone you back\" \u2014 never did. So I looked at other ways of making plastic. And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches. So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic. And for a while that was looking really good. I poured it into the mold, which you can see there, which I've made from a tree trunk. And it was looking good for a while, but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry, and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.So kind of out of desperation, I decided that I could think laterally. And geologists have actually christened \u2014 well, they're debating whether to christen \u2014 the age that we're living in \u2014 they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene, the age of Man. And that's because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now. So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since 1945. And there'd also be an extinction event \u2014 like fossils would suddenly disappear. And also, I thought that there would be synthetic polymers, plastics, embedded in the rock.So I looked up a plastic \u2014 so I decided that I could mine some of this modern-day rock. And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling. And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE, which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive. And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill. But this is it.(Music)(Laughter)So there's a picture of my toaster. (Applause) That's it without the case on. And there it is on the shelves. Thanks.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.TT: Yeah, I did plug it in. I don't know if you could see, but I was never able to make insulation for the wires. Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree. So the wires were uninsulated. So there was 240 volts going through these homemade copper wires, homemade plug. And for about five seconds, the toaster toasted, but then, unfortunately, the element kind of melted itself. But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.BG: Thomas Thwaites.

said, \"Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine.\"\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd the reason I was interested in getting water\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nis because water which goes through mines\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbecomes kind of acidic\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand will start picking up,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ndissolving the minerals from

got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nSo many such\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthat it's now just a home for bacteria\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwho really like acidic, toxic conditions.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nBut anyway, the water I dragged back\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nfrom the Isle of Anglesey where the

plug.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nSo my next thing: I was off to Scotland\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto get mica.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd mica is a mineral\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nwhich is a very good insulator\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand very good at insulating electricity.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThat's me getting mica.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nAnd the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand, of course,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nmy toaster had to have a plastic case.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nPlastic is the defining feature\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nof cheap electrical goods.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand spent a good half an hour\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\ntrying to convince the PR office at BP\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthat it would be fantastic for them\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nif they flew me to an oil rig\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nand let me have a jug of oil.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nBut even then\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nthey weren't convinced\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand said, \"Okay, we'll phone you back\" -- never did.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo I looked at other ways of making plastic.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd you can actually make plastic\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nfrom obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo this is attempting to make\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\npotato starch plastic.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd for a while that was looking really good.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nI poured it into the mold, which you can see there,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwhich I've made from a tree trunk.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd it was looking good for a while,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand unfortunately I came back\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo kind of out of desperation,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nI decided that I could think laterally.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd geologists have actually christened --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwell, they're debating whether to christen --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nthe age that we're living in --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthey're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\ncalled the Anthropocene, the age of Man.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd that's because geologists of the future\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nwould kind of see a sharp shift\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nin the strata of rock that is being laid down now.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSo suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthat have been set off since 1945.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd there'd also be an extinction event --\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nlike fossils would suddenly disappear.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd also, I thought\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat there would be\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nsynthetic polymers,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nplastics, embedded in the rock.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo I looked up a plastic --\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nso I decided that I could mine\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nsome of this modern-day rock.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd I went up to Manchester\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto visit a place called Axion Recycling.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhich is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd that was brought into force\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nto try and deal with the mountain of stuff\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthat is just being made\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nand then living for a while in our homes\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand then going to landfill.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBut this is it.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo there's a picture\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nof my toaster.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThat's it without the case on.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd there it is on the shelves.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThanks.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nTT: Yeah, I did plug it in.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nI don't know if you could see,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nbut I was never able to make insulation for the wires.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nKew Gardens were insistent\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nthat I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo the wires were uninsulated.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo there was 240 volts\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\ngoing through these homemade copper wires,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nhomemade plug.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd for about five seconds,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthe toaster toasted,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nbut then, unfortunately,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthe element kind of melted itself.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nBut I considered it a partial success, to be honest.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nBG: Thomas Thwaites.

I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl. I call them \"the mystic\" and \"the warrior.\" I was born into a family of politically active, intellectual atheists. There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual. I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses. I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So, looking for answers, I went to Catholic mass. I tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates. And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school: Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself, \"I wanna get me one of them.\"And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called \"the optical delusion of everyday consciousness.\" So what did he mean by this? I'll show you. Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. Now, see this strange, underwater, coral reef-looking thing? It's actually a person's trachea, and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now, all around us. If we're blind to this simple biology, imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions. They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.Now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this, the warrior rolls her eyes. She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now. She's worried. She says, \"Excuse me, I'm pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy about them right now.\" I've spent my life as a warrior, working for women's issues, working on political campaigns, being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazy-making, housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic \u2014 people like Martin Luther King, Jr., who wrote, \"I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This,\" he wrote, \"is the interrelated structure of reality.\" Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior, who said, \"The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small.\" And Nelson Mandela, who lives by the African concept of \"ubuntu,\" which means \"I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you.\" Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene. But we all actually have the same capacity that they do, and we need to do their work now.I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing \"the Other\" by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us. Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S. \"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder,\" \"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,\" \"Pinheads and Patriots,\" \"Arguing With Idiots.\" They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek, but they're actually dangerous. Now here's a title that may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you: \"Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice.\" Who wrote that? That was Adolf Hitler's first title for \"Mein Kampf\" \u2014 \"My Struggle\" \u2014 the book that launched the Nazi party. The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda, they start like this, with negative other-izing. And then they morph into violent extremism.This is why I'm launching a new initiative. And it's to help all of us, myself included, to counteract the tendency to \"otherize.\" And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative, \"Take the Other to Lunch.\" If you are a Republican, you can take a Democrat to lunch, or if you're a Democrat, think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite, I suggest you start more local, because there is no shortage of the Other right in your own neighborhood. Maybe that person who worships at the mosque, or the church or the synagogue, down the street. Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict. Or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming. Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you, or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears.A couple of weeks ago, I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test. She's an activist from the Right, and I'm an activist from the Left. And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated, and you can use them too, because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch. So first of all, decide on a goal: to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped. And then, before you get together, agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these: don't persuade, defend or interrupt. Be curious; be conversational; be real. And listen.From there, we dove in. And we used these questions: Share some of your life experiences with me. What issues deeply concern you? And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side? My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side. \"What?\" she wanted to know. \"Like we're a bunch of elitist, morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers.\" Well, she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often, that we called them brainless, gun-toting racists, and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity.We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of \"otherizing\" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness. Neither of us had tried to change the other. But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead, we had taken first steps together, past our knee-jerk reactions, to the ubuntu place, which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found.Who should you invite to lunch? Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, that will be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch? Will the heavens open and \"We Are the World\" play over the restaurant sound system? Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow, and it's difficult. It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls. It's two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it: \"Out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there.\"(Applause)", "id": 1052, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nThis room may appear\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nto be holding 600 people,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nbut there's actually so many more,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbecause in each one of us\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nthere is a multitude of personalities.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nI have two primary personalities\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nthat have been in conflict and conversation within me\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nsince I was a little girl.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nI call them \"the mystic\"\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nand \"the warrior.\"\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nI was born into a family\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nof politically active,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nintellectual atheists.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nThere was this equation in my family that went something like this:\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nif you are intelligent,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nyou therefore are not spiritual.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI was the freak of the family.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nI was this weird little kid\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwho wanted to have deep talks\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nabout the worlds that might exist\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nbeyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nI wanted to know\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nif what we human beings see\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand hear and think\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nis a full and accurate picture\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nof reality.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nSo, looking for answers,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI went to Catholic mass.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nI tagged along with my neighbors.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI read Sartre and Socrates.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nAnd then a wonderful thing happened\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwhen I was in high school:\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nGurus from the East\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nstarted washing up on the shores of America.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd I said to myself,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\n\"I wanna get me one of them.\"\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd ever since,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nI've been walking the mystic path,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\ntrying to peer beyond\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nwhat Albert Einstein called\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\n\"the optical delusion\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nof everyday consciousness.\"\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nSo what did he mean by this?

00:03:10.958\nbeing an activist for the environment.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd it can be sort of crazy-making,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nhousing both the mystic and the

00:07:36.958\nfrom a group you may have negatively stereotyped.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd then, before you get together,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nagree on some ground

--> 00:07:58.958\nFrom there, we dove in.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd we used these questions:\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nShare some of your life experiences with me.\n\n00:08:03.958

going to share just one with you.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nI think it has relevance\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nto any problem\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbetween people

"https://www.ted.com/talks/ali_carr_chellman_gaming_to_re_engage_boys_in_learning", "transcript": "So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys, and it's a serious problem with boys. Their culture isn't working in schools, and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem. First, I want to start by saying, this is a boy, and this is a girl, and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl. If I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say. So I'm not going to do that, I'm not interested in doing that. This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl. So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls, and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls. But, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way, and most girls tend to be a certain way. And the point is that, for boys, the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now.How do we know that? The 100 girls project tells us some really nice statistics. For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school. For every 100 girls who are expelled from school, there are 335 boys who are expelled from school. For every 100 girls in special education, there are 217 boys. For every 100 girls with a learning disability, there are 276 boys. For every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed, we have 324 boys. And by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black, if you happen to be poor, if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. And if you are a boy, you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD \u2014 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.Now there is another side to this. And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school, that salaries are still significantly lower, even when controlled for job types, and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years. That's all true. Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and 13. And so we should. In fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook, because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic. They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations, and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years.Even in their older years, what we find is that there's still a problem. When we look at the universities, 60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now, which is a significant shift. And in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities. This makes university administrators very nervous, because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys. And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university. If you talk to faculty, they may say, \"Ugh. Yeah, well, they're playing video games, and they're gambling online all night long, and they're playing World of Warcraft, and that's affecting their academic achievement.\" Guess what? Video games are not the cause. Video games are a symptom. They were turned off a long time before they got here.So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and 13. There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today. The first is zero tolerance. A kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her, and when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom. What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun? I mean, really. But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today. Now I'm not advocating for bullies. I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives in the school. But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it, has to be suspended from school, I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys. In a lot of classrooms today, you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent. You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games. These topics are banned. Boy comes home from school, and he says, \"I hate writing.\" \"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?\" \"Now I have to write what she tells me to write.\" \"OK, what is she telling you to write?\" \"Poems. I have to write poems. And little moments in my life. I don't want to write that stuff.\" \"Well, what do you want to write? What do you want to write about?\" \"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up. I want to write about this really interesting world. I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out, and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody.\" \"All right. OK.\" You tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness, \"Should we send this child to the psychologist?\" And the answer is no, he's just a boy. He's just a little boy. It's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.So that's the first reason: Zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures: there are fewer male teachers. Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means, because in the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half. We went from 14 percent to seven percent. That means that 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women. Now what's the problem with this? Women are great, yep, absolutely. But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart \u2014 they've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders, but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week they're spending in a classroom, and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist. And so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys. This is a place for girls. And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here. Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen. But less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture \u2014 you've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground. \"What are we going to do with these boys?\" The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table. Are there men around that table? Are there moms who've raised boys around that table? You'll see, the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table.Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today: Kindergarten is the old second grade, folks. We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there. When you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly, or else we'll consider it a developmental delay. By the time you're in first grade, you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages. If you don't, we're probably going to be putting you into a Title I special reading program. And if you ask Title I teachers, they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program, in the elementary grades.The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is, \"You need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time.\" The teacher's salary depends on \"No Child Left Behind\" and \"Race to the Top\" and accountability and testing and all of this. So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum \u2014 and girls. This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids. And what happens is, she says, \"Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told, follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl.\" That's what she tells them. Indirectly, that's what she tells them. And so this is a very serious problem. Where is it coming from? It's coming from us.(Laughter)We want our babies to read when they are six months old. Have you seen the ads? We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average ... but what this does to our children is really not healthy. It's not developmentally appropriate, and it's particularly bad for boys.So what do we do? We need to meet them where they are. We need to put ourselves into boy culture. We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools. More specifically, we can do some very specific things. We can design better games. Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards. They're glorified drill and practice. They don't have the depth, the rich narrative that really engaging video games have, that the boys are really interested in. So we need to design better games. We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom. We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. Do they make sense? We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can, trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them. All of those conversations need to be happening.There are some great examples out there of schools \u2014 the New York Times just talked about a school recently. A game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school. But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable. We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today. We need to find more money for game design. Because good games, really good games, cost money, and World of Warcraft has quite a budget. Most of the educational games do not.Where we started: my colleagues Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself, we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming, what do they say about it. And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school, who talk about gaming, in pretty demeaning ways. They say, \"Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff. They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges, or whatever it is that they get. And they're always talking about this stuff.\" And they say these things as if it's OK. But if it were your culture, think of how that might feel. It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language. They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies. They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything.So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes, so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms. Because, ultimately, if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying, \"Well I guess that was just a place for girls, it wasn't for me. So I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports.\" If we change these things, if we pay attention to these things, and we reengage boys in their learning, they will leave the elementary schools saying, \"I'm smart.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1053, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:16.057\nSo I'm here to tell you\nthat we have a problem with boys,\n\n00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.949\nand it's a serious problem with boys.\n\n00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:21.343\nTheir culture isn't working in schools,\n\n00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.145\nand I'm going to share with you ways\n\n00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.934\nthat we can think\nabout overcoming that problem.\n\n00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:29.229\nFirst, I want to start\nby saying, this is a boy,\n\n00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:31.775\nand this is a girl,\n\n00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:35.347\nand this is probably stereotypically\nwhat you think of as a boy and a girl.\n\n00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:39.154\nIf I essentialize gender for you today,\nthen you can dismiss what I have to say.\n\n00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:42.142\nSo I'm not going to do that,\nI'm not interested in doing that.\n\n00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.383\nThis is a different kind of boy\nand a different kind of girl.\n\n00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:49.840\nSo the point here is that not all boys\nexist within these rigid boundaries\n\n00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:52.054\nof what we think of as boys and girls,\n\n00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:54.633\nand not all girls exist\nwithin those rigid boundaries\n\n00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:56.049\nof what we think of as girls.\n\n00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:59.798\nBut, in fact, most boys\ntend to be a certain way,\n\n00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:01.799\nand most girls tend to be a certain way.\n\n00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:04.062\nAnd the point is that, for boys,\n\n00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:07.272\nthe way that they exist\nand the culture that they embrace\n\n00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.804\nisn't working well in schools now.\n\n00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:11.052\nHow do we know that?\n\n00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:15.835\nThe 100 girls project\ntells us some really nice statistics.\n\n00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.372\nFor example, for every 100 girls\nthat are suspended from school,\n\n00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:22.316\nthere are 250 boys\nthat are suspended from school.\n\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.663\nFor every 100 girls\nwho are expelled from school,\n\n00:01:24.687 --> 00:01:27.487\nthere are 335 boys\nwho are expelled from school.\n\n00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:30.385\nFor every 100 girls in special education,\n\n00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.091\nthere are 217 boys.\n\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.801\nFor every 100 girls\nwith a learning disability,\n\n00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.548\nthere are 276 boys.\n\n00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:41.705\nFor every 100 girls\nwith an emotional disturbance diagnosed,\n\n00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.499\nwe have 324 boys.\n\n00:01:43.523 --> 00:01:47.099\nAnd by the way, all of these numbers\nare significantly higher\n\n00:01:47.123 --> 00:01:48.543\nif you happen to be black,\n\n00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.410\nif you happen to be poor,\n\n00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.958\nif you happen to exist\nin an overcrowded school.\n\n00:01:54.207 --> 00:01:56.328\nAnd if you are a boy,\n\n00:01:56.352 --> 00:02:00.088\nyou're four times as likely\nto be diagnosed with ADHD --\n\n00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:02.573\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\n\n00:02:03.037 --> 00:02:06.098\nNow there is another side to this.\n\n00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:11.732\nAnd it is important that we recognize\nthat women still need help in school,\n\n00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.019\nthat

do\nis take a page from their playbook,\n\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.277\nbecause the initiatives and programs\nthat have been set in place\n\n00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:41.142\nfor women in science and

very nervous,\n\n00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:16.346\nbecause girls don't want to go\nto schools that don't have boys.\n\n00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:20.586\nAnd so we're starting to see\n\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.767\nthe establishment of men centers\nand men studies\n\n00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:28.068\nto think about how do we engage men\nin their experiences in the university.\n\n00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:30.869\nIf you talk to faculty,\nthey may say, \"Ugh. Yeah, well,\n\n00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:32.441\nthey're playing video games,\n\n00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:35.434\nand they're gambling\nonline all night long,\n\n00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:37.273\nand they're playing World of Warcraft,\n\n00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:41.129\nand that's affecting\ntheir academic achievement.\"\n\n00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:43.599\nGuess what?\n\n00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.094\nVideo games are not the cause.\n\n00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:47.933\nVideo games are a symptom.\n\n00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.839\nThey were turned off a long time\nbefore they got here.\n\n00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:55.744\nSo let's talk about\nwhy they got turned off\n\n00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.617\nwhen they were between the ages\nof three and 13.\n\n00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:01.027\nThere are three reasons that I believe\n\n00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:04.313\nthat boys are out of sync\nwith the culture of schools today.\n\n00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:06.934\nThe first is zero tolerance.\n\n00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:12.342\nA kindergarten teacher I know,\nher son donated all of his toys to her,\n\n00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:18.212\nand when he did, she had to go through\nand pull out all the little plastic guns.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.452\nYou can't have plastic knives\nand swords and axes\n\n00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:24.619\nand all that kind of thing\nin a kindergarten classroom.\n\n00:04:24.643 --> 00:04:28.518\nWhat is it that we're afraid that this\nyoung man is going to do with this gun?\n\n00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:29.934\nI mean, really.\n\n00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:32.934\nBut here he stands as testament\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.234\nto the fact that you can't roughhouse\non the playground today.\n\n00:04:36.258 --> 00:04:38.267\nNow I'm not advocating for bullies.\n\n00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:43.494\nI'm not suggesting that we need to be\nallowing guns and knives in the school.\n\n00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:47.774\nBut when we say that an Eagle Scout\nin a high school classroom\n\n00:04:47.798 --> 00:04:51.123\nwho has a locked parked car\nin the parking lot and a penknife in it,\n\n00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:53.170\nhas to be suspended from school,\n\n00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:56.494\nI think we may have gone\na little too far with zero tolerance.\n\n00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:58.846\nAnother way that zero tolerance\nlives itself out\n\n00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.161\nis in the writing of boys.\n\n00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:01.570\nIn a lot of classrooms today,\n\n00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:04.314\nyou're not allowed to write\nabout anything that's violent.\n\n00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:07.864\nYou're not allowed to write about anything\nthat has to do with video games.\n\n00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:09.058\nThese topics are banned.\n\n00:05:09.082 --> 00:05:11.030\nBoy comes home from school, and he says,\n\n00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:12.504\n\"I hate writing.\"\n\n00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:15.255\n\"Why do you hate writing, son?\nWhat's wrong with writing?\"\n\n00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.592\n\"Now I have to write\nwhat she tells me to write.\"\n\n00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.617\n\"OK, what is she telling you to write?\"\n\n00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:22.422\n\"Poems.

OK.\"\n\n00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:47.831\nYou tell a teacher that,\nand they'll ask you, in all seriousness,\n\n00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:50.531\n\"Should we send this child\nto the psychologist?\"\n\n00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:53.934\nAnd the answer is no, he's just a boy.\n\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.261\nHe's just a little boy.\n\n00:05:57.134 --> 00:06:00.933\nIt's not OK to write these kinds of things\nin classrooms today.\n\n00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:03.087\nSo that's the first reason:\n\n00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.660\nZero tolerance policies\nand the way they're lived out.\n\n00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:09.165\nThe next reason that boys' cultures\nare out of sync with school cultures:\n\n00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:10.626\nthere are fewer male teachers.\n\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.409\nAnybody who's over 15\ndoesn't know what this means,\n\n00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:15.189\nbecause in the last 10 years,\n\n00:06:15.213 --> 00:06:19.006\nthe number of elementary school\nclassroom teachers has been cut in half.\n\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.422\nWe went from 14 percent to seven percent.\n\n00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:25.221\nThat means that 93 percent of the teachers\n\n00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:28.364\nthat our young men get in elementary\nclassrooms are women.\n\n00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:31.342\nNow what's the problem with this?\n\n00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.592\nWomen are great, yep, absolutely.\n\n00:06:34.298 --> 00:06:38.740\nBut male role models for boys\nthat say it's all right to be smart --\n\n00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:42.366\nthey've got dads, they've got pastors,\nthey've got Cub Scout leaders,\n\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.474\nbut ultimately, six hours a day,\nfive days a week\n\n00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:47.744\nthey're spending in a classroom,\n\n00:06:47.768 --> 00:06:51.132\nand most of those classrooms\nare not places where men exist.\n\n00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:54.704\nAnd so they say, I guess this really\nisn't a place for boys.\n\n00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.749\nThis is a place for girls.\n\n00:06:56.773 --> 00:06:58.363\nAnd I'm not very good at this,\n\n00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:01.595\nso I guess I'd better go play video games\n\n00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:03.630\nor get into sports,\nor something like that,\n\n00:07:03.654 --> 00:07:05.536\nbecause I obviously don't belong here.\n\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.670\nMen don't belong here,\nthat's pretty obvious.\n\n00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:11.582\nSo that may be a very direct way\nthat we see it happen.\n\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.933\nBut less directly, the lack of male\npresence in the culture --\n\n00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:19.645\nyou've got a teachers' lounge,\nand they're having a conversation\n\n00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:23.796\nabout Joey and Johnny\nwho beat each other up on the playground.\n\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.824\n\"What are we going to do with these boys?\"\n\n00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:27.532\nThe answer to that question changes\n\n00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:29.657\ndepending on who's sitting\naround that table.\n\n00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:31.241\nAre there men around that table?\n\n00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:33.715\nAre there moms who've raised boys\naround that table?\n\n00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:35.481\nYou'll see, the conversation changes\n\n00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:37.653\ndepending upon who's sitting\naround the table.\n\n00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:40.529\nThird reason that boys\nare out of sync with school today:\n\n00:07:40.553 --> 00:07:42.997\nKindergarten is the old\nsecond grade, folks.\n\n00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:46.933\nWe have a serious compression\nof the curriculum happening out there.\n\n00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.383\nWhen you're three, you better be able\nto write your name legibly,\n\n00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:52.984\nor else we'll consider it\na developmental delay.\n\n00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:55.095\nBy the time you're in first grade,\n\n00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:57.724\nyou should be able to read\nparagraphs of text\n\n00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:01.228\nwith maybe a picture, maybe not,\nin a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.\n\n00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:02.432\nIf you don't,\n\n00:08:02.456 --> 00:08:06.131\nwe're probably going to be putting you\ninto a Title I special reading program.\n\n00:08:06.155 --> 00:08:08.453\nAnd if you ask Title I teachers,\nthey'll tell you\n\n00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:12.096\nthey've got about four or five boys\nfor every girl that's in their program,\n\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.324\nin the elementary grades.\n\n00:08:13.348 --> 00:08:15.102\nThe reason that this is a problem\n\n00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:18.179\nis because the message\nthat boys are getting\n\n00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:22.545\nis, \"You need to do what the teacher\nasks you to do all the time.\"\n\n00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.210\nThe teacher's salary depends\non \"No Child Left Behind\"\n\n00:08:27.234 --> 00:08:29.934\nand \"Race to the Top\"\nand accountability and testing\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.934\nand all of this.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.932\nSo she has to figure out a way\nto get all these boys\n\n00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:38.933\nthrough this curriculum -- and girls.\n\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.419\nThis compressed curriculum is bad\nfor all active kids.\n\n00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:46.264\nAnd what happens is,\n\n00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:50.948\nshe says, \"Please, sit down,\nbe quiet, do what you're told,\n\n00:08:50.972 --> 00:08:55.924\nfollow the rules, manage your time,\nfocus, be a girl.\"\n\n00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:58.825\nThat's what she tells them.\n\n00:08:58.849 --> 00:09:00.934\nIndirectly, that's what she tells them.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.018\nAnd so this is a very serious problem.\n\n00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.399\nWhere is it coming from?\nIt's coming from us.\n\n00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:07.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.658\nWe want our babies to read\nwhen they are six months old.\n\n00:09:11.682 --> 00:09:12.934\nHave you seen the ads?\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.638\nWe want to live in Lake Wobegon\nwhere every child is above average ...\n\n00:09:18.356 --> 00:09:21.800\nbut what this does to our children\nis really not healthy.\n\n00:09:21.824 --> 00:09:23.634\nIt's not developmentally appropriate,\n\n00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:25.634\nand it's particularly bad for boys.\n\n00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:27.377\nSo what do we do?\n\n00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:29.583\nWe need to meet them where they are.\n\n00:09:29.607 --> 00:09:31.871\nWe need to put ourselves into boy culture.\n\n00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:37.150\nWe need to change the mindset\nof acceptance in boys\n\n00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:38.612\nin elementary schools.\n\n00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:42.322\nMore specifically, we can do\nsome very specific things.\n\n00:09:42.346 --> 00:09:43.934\nWe can design better games.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.773\nMost of the educational games\nthat are out there today\n\n00:09:46.797 --> 00:09:48.322\nare really flashcards.\n\n00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:50.288\nThey're glorified drill and practice.\n\n00:09:50.312 --> 00:09:53.125\nThey don't have the depth,\nthe rich narrative\n\n00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:55.901\nthat really engaging video games have,\n\n00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.928\nthat the boys are really interested in.\n\n00:09:57.952 --> 00:09:59.594\nSo we need to design better games.\n\n00:09:59.618 --> 00:10:03.444\nWe need to talk to teachers and parents\nand school board members and politicians.\n\n00:10:03.468 --> 00:10:07.044\nWe need to make sure that people see\nthat we need more men in the classroom.\n\n00:10:07.068 --> 00:10:09.762\nWe need to look carefully\nat our zero tolerance policies.\n\n00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:10.954\nDo they make sense?\n\n00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:14.934\nWe need to think about how to uncompress\nthis curriculum if we can,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.423\ntrying to bring boys back into a space\nthat is comfortable for them.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.244\nAll of those conversations\nneed to be happening.\n\n00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:24.071\nThere are some great examples\nout there of schools --\n\n00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:27.578\nthe New York Times\njust talked about a school recently.\n\n00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:29.934\nA game designer from the New School\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.934\nput together a wonderful\nvideo gaming school.\n\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.187\nBut it only treats a few kids,\nand so this isn't very scalable.\n\n00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:40.367\nWe have to change the culture\nand the feelings\n\n00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:45.213\nthat politicians and school board\nmembers and parents have\n\n00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:48.304\nabout the way we accept\nand what we accept in our schools today.\n\n00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:50.337\nWe need to find more money\nfor game design.\n\n00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:52.715\nBecause good games,\nreally good games, cost money,\n\n00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:54.726\nand World of Warcraft has quite a budget.\n\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.842\nMost of the educational games do not.\n\n00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:58.114\nWhere we started:\n\n00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:00.934\nmy colleagues Mike Petner,\nShawn Vashaw, myself,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.549\nwe started by trying to look\nat the teachers' attitudes\n\n00:11:03.573 --> 00:11:05.918\nand find out how do they really\nfeel about gaming,\n\n00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:07.202\nwhat do they say about it.\n\n00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:12.200\nAnd we discovered that they talk\nabout the kids in their school,\n\n00:11:12.224 --> 00:11:14.933\nwho talk about gaming,\nin pretty demeaning ways.\n\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.683\nThey say, \"Oh, yeah. They're always\ntalking about that stuff.\n\n00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:21.031\nThey're talking\nabout their little action figures\n\n00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.443\nand their little achievements\nor merit badges,\n\n00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:25.525\nor whatever it is that they get.\n\n00:11:25.549 --> 00:11:27.651\nAnd they're always talking\nabout this stuff.\"\n\n00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.632\nAnd they say these things as if it's OK.\n\n00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:32.934\nBut if it were your culture,\nthink of how that might feel.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.339\nIt's very uncomfortable\nto be on the receiving end\n\n00:11:35.363 --> 00:11:37.545\nof that kind of language.\n\n00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:41.150\nThey're nervous about anything\nthat has anything to do with violence\n\n00:11:41.174 --> 00:11:43.059\nbecause of the zero tolerance policies.\n\n00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:45.194\nThey are sure that parents\nand administrators\n\n00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:46.516\nwill never accept anything.\n\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.424\nSo we really need to think\nabout looking at teacher attitudes\n\n00:11:49.448 --> 00:11:52.210\nand finding ways to change the attitudes,\n\n00:11:52.234 --> 00:11:56.204\nso that teachers are much more open\nand accepting of boy cultures\n\n00:11:56.228 --> 00:11:57.418\nin their classrooms.\n\n00:11:57.442 --> 00:11:59.510\nBecause, ultimately, if we don't,\n\n00:11:59.534 --> 00:12:02.806\nthen we're going to have boys\nwho leave elementary school saying,\n\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.858\n\"Well I guess that was just\na place for girls, it wasn't for me.\n\n00:12:05.882 --> 00:12:08.657\nSo I've got to do gaming,\nor I've got to do sports.\"\n\n00:12:09.114 --> 00:12:12.127\nIf we change these things,\nif we pay attention to these things,\n\n00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:14.070\nand we reengage boys in their learning,\n\n00:12:14.094 --> 00:12:17.268\nthey will leave the elementary\nschools saying, \"I'm smart.\"\n\n00:12:18.092 --> 00:12:19.243\nThank you.\n\n00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:21.743\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Addicted to risk", "duration": "1189", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/naomi_klein_addicted_to_risk", "transcript": "I just did something I've never done before. I spent a week at sea on a research vessel. Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the boat we were on, by the way. The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff \u2014 the birds, the turtles, the dolphins, the glamorous stuff. They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff. And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it. So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding. It's still working its way up the food chain. Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us. Rachel Carson \u2014 the godmother of modern environmentalism \u2014 warned us about this very thing back in 1962. She pointed out that the \"control men\" \u2014 as she called them \u2014 who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT, were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects, not the birds. But they forgot this: the fact that birds dine on grubs, that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT. And so, robin eggs failed to hatch, songbirds died en masse, towns fell silent. Thus the title \"Silent Spring.\" I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties. And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster, with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world, with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV, 24 hours a day, for months. After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature, suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness, with our lack of control, as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it \u2014 \"top hats,\" \"top kills\" and, most memorably, the \"junk shot\" \u2014 the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world. But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed \u2014 the carelessness, the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up. If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy. And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years. Our leaders barrel into wars, telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades. Then, it is years of deadly damage control, Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies, and once again, no exit strategy. Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence, convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market \u2014 the kind that never goes down. And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot \u2014 in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole. As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price. We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all \u2014 deciding what to do, or not to do, about climate change. Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, \"What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?\" Now a far more relevant question \u2014 as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it \u2014 is, \"What if those scientists are right?\" Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle \u2014 the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty. Better to err on the side of caution. More overt, the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed, but rather on the industry that stands to profit. But climate policy in the wealthy world \u2014 to the extent that such a thing exists \u2014 is not based on precaution, but rather on cost-benefit analysis \u2014 finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP. So rather than asking, as precaution would demand, what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe, we ask bizarre questions like this: \"What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions? Can we put this off till 2020, 2030, 2050?\" Or we ask, \"How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive? Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or \u2014 where we're currently going \u2014 four degrees Celsius?\" And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right \u2014 sort of Goldilocks style \u2014 this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists. It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science. The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops. So once again, why do we take these crazy risks with the precious? A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now, like \"greed.\" This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it, because taking big risks, as we all know, pays a lot of money. Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris. And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness. For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay. And you actually don't have a lot of options. You're either an incredibly good scammer, and you're getting away with it \u2014 you gamed the system \u2014 or you're some kind of boy genius, the likes of which the world has never seen. Now both of these options \u2014 the boy genius and the scammer \u2014 are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP, had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan: \"What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?\" Now this is actually a popular plaque, and this is a crowd of overachievers, so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque. Don't feel ashamed. Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk, but personally, I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall, because \u2014 maybe not that one in particular \u2014 but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time. So we have greed, we've got overconfidence/hubris, but since we're here at TEDWomen, let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness. Now I'm not going to belabor this point, but studies do show that, as investors, women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men, precisely because, as we've already heard, women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do. So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides \u2014 for society at least. The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted, chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides. And this problem \u2014 call it the \"perils of privilege\" \u2014 brings us closer, I think, to the root of our collective recklessness. Because none of us \u2014 at least in the global North \u2014 neither men nor women, are fully exempt from this message. Here's what I'm talking about. Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them, our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature \u2014 the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer, the narrative of manifest destiny, the narrative of apocalypse and salvation. And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places. For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone, and yes, it really does say, \"Slap Mother Nature in the face.\" And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola \u2014 that's just a bonus. I'm showing it because \u2014 they're not a sponsor, are they? \u2014 because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story. We slapped Mother Nature around and won, and we always win, because dominating nature is our destiny. But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature. There's another one, equally important, about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance. Let's hear from Tony Hayward again. \"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume.\" In other words, the ocean is big; she can take it. It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do. Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more \u2014 more water, more land, more untapped resources. A new bubble will replace the old one. A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped. And it's also the story of modern capitalism, because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system, one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers. Now the problem is that the story was always a lie. The Earth always did have limits. They were just beyond our sights. And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop. Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories, but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that, frankly, verges on camp. How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin? Now on the one hand, exhorting us to \"drill, baby, drill,\" because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them, and on the other, glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show. The twin message is as comforting as it is mad. Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall. There are still no limits. There will always be another frontier. So stop worrying and keep shopping. Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual. This assessment, unfortunately, is far too optimistic. The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy. So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water, including the icy Arctic seas, where a clean-up may simply be impossible. It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen. And most controversially, it means the tar sands. I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States. It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else. So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests. The oil is not liquid. You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. Tar sand's oil is solid, mixed in with the soil. So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees. Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates. Now looking at these images, it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation, which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England. I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth, the largest ever built. That's a person down there by the wheel. My point is that this is not oil drilling. It's not even mining. It is terrestrial skinning. Vast, vivid landscapes are being gutted, left monochromatic gray. Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon. But the truth is that, on average, turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada. How else to describe this, but as a form of mass insanity? Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet, off the power of sun, wind and waves, we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest, highest-emitting stuff imaginable. This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country \u2014 a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long. As Jared Diamond and others have shown us, this is how civilizations commit suicide, by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes. The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too. At the very last minute, we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie, just like in the Rapture. But, of course, our secular religion is technology. Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these. The idea behind this form of \"geoengineering\" as it's called, is that, as the planet heats up, we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space, thereby cooling the planet. The wackiest plan \u2014 and I'm not making this up \u2014 would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky, suspended by balloons, to spew sulfur dioxide. So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution. Think of it as the ultimate junk shot. The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested. They don't know if they'll work, and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash. Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles, particularly media circles, with a relief tinged with euphoria. An escape hatch has been reached. A new frontier has been found. Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all. You see, for some people, their savior is a guy in a flowing robe. For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose. We badly need some new stories. We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks \u2014 risks that confront recklessness head on, that put the precautionary principle into practice, even if that means through direct action \u2014 like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested, blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining. We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. That this is our only home. There is no escape hatch. Call it karma, call it physics, action and reaction, call it precaution \u2014 the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit. Thank you.

--> 00:06:24.958\nCan we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhere we're currently going --\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfour degrees Celsius?\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nAnd by the way,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthe assumption that we can safely control\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthe Earth's awesomely complex climate system\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nas if it had a thermostat,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nmaking the planet not too hot, not too cold,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nthis is pure fantasy,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand it's not coming from the climate scientists.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIt's coming from the economists\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nimposing their mechanistic thinking\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\non the science.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThe fact is that we simply don't know\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nwhen the warming that we create\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nwill be utterly overwhelmed\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nby feedback loops.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nSo once again,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwhy do we take these crazy risks\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwith the precious?\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nA range of explanations\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nmay be popping into your mind by now,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nlike \"greed.\"\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nThis is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nbecause taking big risks, as we all know,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\npays a lot of money.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnother explanation that you often hear for recklessness\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nis hubris.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd greed and hubris\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nare intimately intertwined\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwhen it comes to recklessness.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nFor instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\ntaking home 100 times more\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthan a brain surgeon,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthen you need a narrative,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nyou need a story\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat makes that disparity okay.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd you actually don't have a lot of options.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nYou're either an incredibly good scammer,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nor you're some kind of boy genius,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthe likes of which the world has never seen.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nNow both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nare going to make you vastly overconfident\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand therefore more prone\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nto taking even bigger risks in the future.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBy the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nhad a plaque on his desk\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ninscribed with this inspirational slogan:\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\n\"What would you attempt to do\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nif you knew you could not fail?\"\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow this is actually a popular plaque,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand this is a crowd of overachievers,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nso I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nDon't feel ashamed.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nPutting fear of failure out of your mind\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ncan be a very good thing\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nif you're training for a triathlon\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nor preparing to give a TEDTalk,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbut personally, I think people with the power\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nto detonate our economy and ravage our ecology\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwould do better having\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\na picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbecause -- maybe not that one in particular --\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nbut I want them thinking about the possibility of failure\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nall of the time.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nSo we have greed,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwe've got overconfidence/hubris,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nbut since we're here at TEDWomen,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nlet's consider one other factor\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthat could be contributing in some small way\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nto societal recklessness.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nNow I'm not going to belabor this point,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nbut studies do show that, as investors,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nwomen are much less prone\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto taking reckless risks than men,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nprecisely because, as we've already heard,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nwomen tend not to suffer from overconfidence\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nin the same way that men do.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo it turns out\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthat being paid less and praised less\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nhas its upsides --\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nfor society at least.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe flipside of this\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nis that constantly being told\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat you are gifted, chosen\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand born to rule\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nhas distinct societal downsides.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd this problem -- call it the \"perils of privilege\" --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbrings us closer, I think,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nto the root of our collective recklessness.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nBecause none of us -- at least in the global North --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nneither men nor women,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nare fully exempt from this message.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nHere's what I'm talking about.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWhether we actively believe them\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nor consciously reject them,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nour culture remains in the grips\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nof certain archetypal stories\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nabout our supremacy\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nover others and over nature --\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe narrative of the newly discovered frontier\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand the conquering pioneer,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe narrative of manifest destiny,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthe narrative of apocalypse and salvation.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd just when you think these stories are fading into history,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand that we've gotten over them,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthey pop up in the strangest places.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nFor instance, I stumbled across this advertisement\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\noutside the women's washroom\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nin the Kansas City airport.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIt's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand yes, it really does say,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n\"Slap Mother Nature in the face.\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat's just a bonus.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nI'm showing it because --\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthey're not a sponsor, are they? --\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nbecause, in its own way,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthis is a crass version\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nof our founding story.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe slapped Mother Nature around and won,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand we always win,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nbecause dominating nature is our destiny.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nBut this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThere's another one, equally important,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nabout how that very same Mother Nature\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nis so nurturing and so resilient\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthat we can never make a dent in her abundance.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nLet's hear from Tony Hayward again.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n\"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThe amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nis tiny in relation to the total water volume.\"\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nIn other words, the ocean is big;\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nshe can take it.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt is this underlying assumption of limitlessness\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat makes it possible\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nto take the reckless risks that we do.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nBecause this is our real master-narrative:\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nhowever much we mess up,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthere will always be more --\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nmore water, more land,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nmore untapped resources.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nA new bubble will replace the old one.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nA new technology will come along\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nto fix the messes we made with the last one.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIn a way, that is the story\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nof the settling of the Americas,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthe supposedly inexhaustible frontier\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nto which Europeans escaped.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd it's also the story of modern capitalism,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nbecause it was the wealth from this land\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat gave birth to our economic system,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\none that cannot survive without perpetual growth\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand an unending supply\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nof new frontiers.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nNow the problem is\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthat the story was always a lie.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThe Earth always did have limits.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThey were just beyond our sights.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd now we are hitting those limits\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\non multiple fronts.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nI believe that we know this,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nyet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nNot only do we continue to tell and retell\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe same tired stories,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nbut we are now doing so\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nwith a frenzy and a fury\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nthat, frankly, verges on camp.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nHow else to explain the cultural space\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\noccupied by Sarah Palin?\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nNow on the one hand,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nexhorting us to \"drill, baby, drill,\"\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nbecause God put those resources into the ground\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nin order for us to exploit them,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand on the other, glorying in the wilderness\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof Alaska's untouched beauty\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\non her hit reality TV show.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThe twin message is as comforting as it is mad.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nIgnore those creeping fears\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nthat we have finally hit the wall.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThere are still no limits.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThere will always be another frontier.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nSo stop worrying and keep shopping.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nNow, would that this were just about\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSarah Palin and her reality TV show.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nIn environmental circles,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nwe often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nwe are continuing with business as usual.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThis assessment, unfortunately,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis far too optimistic.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nThe truth is that we have already exhausted\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nso much of the easily accessible fossil fuels\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthat we have already entered\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\na far riskier business era,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthe era of extreme energy.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nSo that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nincluding the icy Arctic seas,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhere a clean-up may simply be impossible.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nIt means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand massive strip-mining operations for coal,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nthe likes of which we haven't yet seen.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAnd most controversially, it means the tar sands.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nI'm always surprised by how little\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\npeople outside of Canada\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nknow about the Alberta Tar Sands,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwhich this year are projected to become\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nthe number one source of imported oil\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nto the United States.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nIt's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nbecause I believe it speaks to recklessness\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand the path we're on\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nlike little else.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nSo this is where the tar sands live,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nunder one of the last magnificent\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nBoreal forests.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThe oil is not liquid.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nYou can't just drill a hole and pump it out.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nTar sand's oil is solid,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nmixed in with the soil.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo to get at it,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nyou first have to get rid of the trees.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThen, you rip off the topsoil\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand get at that oily sand.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThe process requires a huge amount of water,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nwhich is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThat's very bad news for local indigenous people\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nliving downstream\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nwho are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nNow looking at these images,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nit's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwhich can already be seen from space\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand could grow to an area the size of England.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI find it helps actually\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nto look at the dump trucks that move the earth,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nthe largest ever built.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThat's a person down there by the wheel.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nMy point is that\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nthis is not oil drilling.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nIt's not even mining.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nIt is terrestrial skinning.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nVast, vivid landscapes\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nare being gutted,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nleft monochromatic gray.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nNow I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthis would be an abomination\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nif it emitted not one particle of carbon.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nBut the truth is that, on average,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nturning that gunk into crude oil\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nproduces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nthan it does to produce conventional oil\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nin Canada.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nHow else to describe this,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nbut as a form of mass insanity?\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nJust when we know we need to be learning\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nto live on the surface of our planet,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\noff the power of sun, wind and waves,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwe are frantically digging\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nto get at the dirtiest,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nhighest-emitting stuff imaginable.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nThis is where our story of endless growth\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nhas taken us,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nto this black hole at the center of my country --\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\na place of such planetary pain\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthat, like the BP gusher,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\none can only stand to look at it for so long.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nAs Jared Diamond and others have shown us,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nthis is how civilizations commit suicide,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nby slamming their foot on the accelerator\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nat the exact moment\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nwhen they should be putting on the brakes.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nThe problem is that our master-narrative\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nhas an answer for that too.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nAt the very last minute, we are going to get saved\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\njust like in every Hollywood movie,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\njust like in the Rapture.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nBut, of course, our secular religion is technology.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nNow, you may have noticed\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nmore and more headlines like these.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nThe idea behind this form of \"geoengineering\" as it's called,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nis that, as the planet heats up,\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nwe may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\ninto the stratosphere\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nto reflect some of the sun's rays\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nback to space,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nthereby cooling the planet.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nThe wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nwould put what is essentially a garden hose\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\n18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nsuspended by balloons,\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nto spew sulfur dioxide.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nSo, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nThink of it as the ultimate junk shot.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nThe serious scientists involved in this research\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nall stress that these techniques\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nare entirely untested.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nThey don't know if they'll work,\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nand they have no idea\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nwhat kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nNevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nis being greeted in some circles,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nparticularly media circles,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nwith a relief tinged with euphoria.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nAn escape hatch has been reached.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nA new frontier has been found.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nMost importantly,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nwe don't have to change our lifestyles after all.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nYou see, for some people,\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.958\ntheir savior is a guy in a flowing robe.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nFor other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nWe badly need some new stories.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nWe need stories that have different kinds of heroes\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nwilling to take different kinds of risks --\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nrisks that confront recklessness head on,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthat put the precautionary principle into practice,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\neven if that means through direct action --\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nlike hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nblocking dirty power plants\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nor fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nWe need stories\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nthat replace that linear narrative of endless growth\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nwith circular narratives\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nthat remind us\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nthat what goes around comes around.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nThat this is our only home.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nThere is no escape hatch.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nCall it karma, call it physics,\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\naction and reaction, call it precaution --\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nthe principle that reminds us\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nthat life is too precious to be risked\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nfor any profit.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nThank you.\n\n00:19:32.958

"transcript": "You may not know this, but you are celebrating an anniversary with me. I'm not married, but one year ago today, I woke up from a month-long coma, following a double lung transplant. Crazy, I know. Insane. Thank you.Six years before that, I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe, when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension \u2014 also known as PH. It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins, making the right side of the heart work overtime, and causing what I call the reverse-Grinch effect. My heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big. Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition, and usually after two to five years, you die. I went to see this specialist, and she was top-of-the-field and told me I had to stop singing. She said, \"Those high notes are going to kill you.\" While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension, she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. I was very limited by my condition, physically. But I was not limited when I sang, and as air came up from my lungs, through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound, it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence. And just because of someone's hunch, I wasn't going to give it up.Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis, who is dry as toast, but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive, they wanted me to live a meaningful life. This meant making trade-offs. I come from Colorado. It's a mile high, and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters and two adoring parents. Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby. I couldn't walk as much as I used to, so I opted for five-inch heels. And I gave up salt, I went vegan, and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil, also known as Viagra.(Laughter)My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH, but after six months, I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint. I had a heart catheterization, where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure, which is supposed to be between 15 and 20. Mine was 146. I like to do things big, and it meant one thing: there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan, and it's not just a drug; it's a way of life. Doctors insert a catheter into your chest, which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds. Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side, administering medicine directly to your heart, and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses. This is a list of the side effects: if you eat too much salt, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'll probably end up in the ICU. If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die. If you get a bubble in your medicine \u2014 because you have to mix it every morning \u2014 and it stays in there, you probably die. If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.No one wants to go on Flolan. But when I needed it, it was a godsend. Within a few days, I could walk again. Within a few weeks, I was performing, and in a few months, I debuted at the Kennedy Center. The pump was a little bit problematic when performing, so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage. Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx, hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly. And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers. I graduated from graduate school in 2006, and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. A few days after arriving, I met this wonderful, old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles. And before long, I was commuting between Budapest, Milan and Florence. Though I was attached to this ugly, unwanted, high-maintenance, mechanical pet, my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera \u2014 very complicated, but in a good way.Then in February of 2008, my grandfather passed away. He was a big figure in all of our lives, and we loved him very much. It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next. Seven weeks later, I got a call from my family. My father had been in a catastrophic car accident, and he died. At 24, my death would have been entirely expected. But his \u2014 well, the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. Against my doctors' and family's wishes, I needed to go back for the funeral. I had to say goodbye in some way, shape or form. But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure, and I had to return to sea level, doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again.I canceled most of my engagements that summer, but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went. After one performance, I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face, and in the heat of the desert, I was freezing cold. My fingers started turning blue, and I was like, \"What is going on here?\" I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed. The cab stopped, and I pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator. I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem: I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine. I was dying, and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast, I would never leave that apartment alive. I started mixing, and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another, but I just kept on going. Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out, I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough. If it didn't, I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated. Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay.We're not big on fear in my family, but I was scared. I went back to the States, anticipating I'd return to Europe, but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. I performed here and there, but as my condition deteriorated, so did my voice. My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant. I didn't. I had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries. I knew another young man, though, who had PH who died while waiting for one. I wanted to live. I thought stem cells were a good option, but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet. I officially took a break from singing, and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years, for transplant. I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon, and I asked him if I needed a transplant, what I could do to prepare. He said, \"Be happy. A happy patient is a healthy patient.\" It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius. I still didn't want a transplant, but in a month, I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles \u2014 very attractive. And it was right-heart failure.I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match. But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call. It was my doctor in Cleveland, Marie Budev. And they had lungs. It was a match. They were from Texas. And everybody was really happy for me, but me. Because, despite their problems, I had spent my whole life training my lungs, and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up. I flew to Cleveland, and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye. But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket, telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again, and to please try and save my voice. I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery, I flatlined twice, 40 quarts of blood were infused into my body. And in my surgeon's 20-year career, he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed. They left my chest open for two weeks. You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it. I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive. An infection ravaged my skin. I had hoped my voice would be saved, but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it. If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again. So my doctor got the ENT, the top guy at the clinic, to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box. He said it would kill me. So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery, she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed. And if you want an example of perseverance, grit and strength in a beautiful, little package, it is her. One year ago to this very day, I woke up. I was 95 lbs. There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body. I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I certainly couldn't sing, I couldn't even breathe, but when I looked up and I saw my mother, I couldn't help but smile.Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens. But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it? It's about living. Medical conditions don't negate the human condition. And when people are allowed to pursue their passions, doctors will find they have better, happier and healthier patients. My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place, but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time. And I'm so grateful they did.This past summer, when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies, I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. And I wanted to tell her, and I want to tell you, we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams. When we do, we will find that patients don't just survive; we thrive. And some of us might even sing.(Applause) [Singing: French]Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee. (Applause) Thank you so much.

I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI could barely stand up\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nwithout feeling like I was going to faint.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nI had a heart catheterization,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nwhere they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nwhich is supposed to be between 15 and 20.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nMine was 146.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nI like to do things big,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand it meant one thing:\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthere is a big gun treatment\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nfor pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand it's not just a drug;\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nit's a way of life.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nDoctors insert a catheter into your chest,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwhich is attached to a pump\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthat weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nEvery day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nadministering medicine\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ndirectly to your heart,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand it's not\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\na particularly preferable\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nmedicine in many senses.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis is a list of the side effects:\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nif you eat too much salt,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nlike a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nyou'll probably end up in the ICU.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIf you go through a metal detector,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nyou'll probably die.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nIf you get a bubble in your medicine --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nbecause you have to mix it every morning --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand it stays in there,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nyou probably die.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nIf you run out of medicine, you definitely die.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nNo one wants to go on Flolan.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nBut when I needed it,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nit was a godsend.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nWithin a few days, I could walk again.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nWithin a few weeks, I was performing,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand in a few months,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nI debuted at the Kennedy Center.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThe pump was a little bit problematic when performing,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nso I'd attach it to my inner thigh\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwith the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nLiterally hundreds of elevator rides\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwere spent with me alone\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nstuffing the pump into my Spanx,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nhoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd the tubing coming out of my chest\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nwas a nightmare for costume designers.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI graduated from graduate school in 2006,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nA few days after arriving,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nI met this wonderful, old conductor\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwho started casting me in all of these roles.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd before long, I was commuting\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbetween Budapest, Milan\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand Florence.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThough I was attached\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nto this ugly, unwanted,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nhigh-maintenance, mechanical pet,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nmy life was kind of like the happy part in an opera --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nvery complicated,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut in a good way.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThen in February\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nof 2008,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nmy grandfather passed away.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nHe was a big figure in all of our lives,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nand we loved him very much.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nIt certainly didn't prepare me\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nfor what came next.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nSeven weeks later,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI got a call from my family.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nMy father had been in a catastrophic car accident,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nand he died.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAt 24, my death would have been\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nentirely expected.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBut his --\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwell, the only way I can articulate how it felt\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwas that it precipitated\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nmy medical decline.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAgainst my doctors' and family's wishes,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI needed to go back for the funeral.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nI had to say goodbye\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nin some way, shape or form.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nBut soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nand I had to return to sea level,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\ndoing so knowing\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat I probably would never see my home again.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nI canceled most of my engagements that summer,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nbut I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAfter one performance,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nI could barely drag myself\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nfrom the stage to the taxicab.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI sat down and felt the blood\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nrush down from my face,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand in the heat of the desert,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nI was freezing cold.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nMy fingers started turning blue,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand I was like, \"What is going on here?\"\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nI heard my heart's valves\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nsnapping open and closed.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThe cab stopped,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand I pulled my body from it\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nfeeling each ounce of weight\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nas I walked to the elevator.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nI fell through my apartment door\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand crawled to the bathroom\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwhere I found my problem:\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nI had forgotten to mix in\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthe most important part of my medicine.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nI was dying,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nand if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nI would never leave that apartment alive.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI started mixing,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nand I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbut I just kept on going.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nFinally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nI attached the pump to the tubing\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand lay there hoping it would kick in\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nsoon enough.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nIf it didn't, I'd probably see my father\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nsooner than I anticipated.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThankfully, in a few minutes,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI saw the signature hive-like rash\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nappear on my legs,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwhich is a side effect of the medication,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand I knew I'd be okay.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nWe're not big on fear in my family,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbut I was scared.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nI went back to the States,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nanticipating I'd return to Europe,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nbut the heart catheterization\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nshowed that I wasn't going anywhere\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nfurther that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nI performed here and there,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nbut as my condition deteriorated,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nso did my voice.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nMy doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI didn't.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nI had two friends who had recently died\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nmonths after having very challenging surgeries.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nI knew another young man, though, who had PH\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nwho died while waiting for one.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nI wanted to live.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI thought stem cells were a good option,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nbut they hadn't developed to a point\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nwhere I could take advantage of them yet.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nI officially took a break from singing,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand I went to the Cleveland Clinic\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nto be reevaluated\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nfor the third time in five years, for transplant.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nI was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nwith the head transplant surgeon,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand I asked him if I needed a transplant,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nwhat I could do to prepare.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nHe said, \"Be happy.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nA happy patient\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nis a healthy patient.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt was like in one verbal swoop\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nhe had channeled my thoughts\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\non life and medicine\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand Confucius.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nI still didn't want a transplant,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbut in a month,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nI was back in the hospital\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwith some severely edemic kankles --\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nvery attractive.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd it was right-heart failure.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI finally decided\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nit was time to take my doctor's advice.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nIt was time for me to go to Cleveland\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nand to start the agonizing wait\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nfor a match.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut the next morning,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwhile I was still in the hospital,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nI got a telephone call.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIt was my doctor in Cleveland,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nMarie Budev.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd they had lungs.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nIt was a match.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThey were from Texas.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd everybody was really happy for me,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nbut me.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nBecause, despite their problems,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nI had spent my whole life training my lungs,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nand I was not particularly enthusiastic\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nabout giving them up.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nI flew to Cleveland,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nand my family rushed there\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nin hopes that they would meet me\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand say what we knew\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nmight be our final goodbye.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nBut organs don't wait,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand I went into surgery\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nbefore I could say goodbye.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThe last thing I remember\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nwas lying on a white blanket,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\ntelling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand to please try and save my voice.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI fell into this apocalyptic dream world.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nDuring the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI flatlined twice,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\n40 quarts of blood\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nwere infused into my body.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd in my surgeon's 20-year career,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nhe said it was among the most difficult transplants\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthat he's ever performed.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nThey left my chest open for two weeks.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nYou could see my over-sized heart\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nbeating inside of it.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nI was on a dozen machines\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthat were keeping me alive.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAn infection ravaged my skin.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nI had hoped my voice would be saved,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nbut my doctors knew\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthat the breathing tubes going down my throat\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nmight have already destroyed it.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nIf they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo my doctor got the ENT,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nthe top guy at the clinic, to come down\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand give me surgery\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nto move the tubes around my voice box.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nHe said it would kill me.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nSo my own surgeon performed the procedure\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nin a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nThough my mom couldn't say goodbye to me\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nbefore the surgery,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nshe didn't leave my side\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nin the months of recovery that followed.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd if you want an example\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nof perseverance,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\ngrit and strength\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nin a beautiful, little package,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nit is her.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nOne year ago\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nto this very day,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nI woke up.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nI was 95 lbs.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThere were a dozen tubes\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\ncoming in and out of my body.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nI couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nI couldn't eat, I couldn't move,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nI certainly couldn't sing,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nI couldn't even breathe,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nbut when I looked up\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand I saw my mother,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nI couldn't help but smile.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWhether by a Mack truck\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nor by heart failure\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nor faulty lungs,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\ndeath happens.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIt's about living.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nMedical conditions don't negate the human condition.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd when people are allowed\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nto pursue their passions,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\ndoctors will find they have better,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nhappier and healthier patients.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nMy parents were totally stressed out\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nabout me going and auditioning\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand traveling and performing all over the place,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbut they knew that it was much better for me to do that\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nthan be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd I'm so grateful they did.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThis past summer, when I was running and singing\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nin the Colorado Rockies,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nI couldn't help but think of that doctor\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nwho told me that I couldn't sing.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd I wanted to tell her,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand I want to tell you,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwe need to stop letting disease\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\ndivorce us from our dreams.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWhen we do,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe will find that patients\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ndon't just survive;\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwe thrive.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAnd some of us\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nmight even sing.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:17:32.958\n[Singing: French]\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:41.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nThank you so much.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "The economic injustice of plastic", "duration": "769", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/van_jones_the_economic_injustice_of_plastic", "transcript": "I am honored to be here, and I'm honored to talk about this topic, which I think is of grave importance. We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species, but plastic hurts people, too \u2014 especially poor people. And both in the production of plastic, the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic, the people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads are poor people. People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened, for very good reason. People thought, \"Oh, my God. This is terrible, this oil \u2014 it's in the water. It's going to destroy the living systems there. People are going to be hurt. This is a terrible thing, this oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf.\"What people don't think about is: What if the oil had made it safely to shore? What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go? Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming, but there's a place called \"Cancer Alley,\" and the reason it's called \"Cancer Alley\" is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and in the process, kills people. It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf. So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill; they're a problem when there's not. And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products.The other thing we often don't appreciate is, it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. Poor people also suffer at the point of use. Those of us who earn a certain income level, we have something called choice. The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices, economic choices. We actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous, poisonous plastic in them. Other people who are poor don't have those choices. So low-income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. Those are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic in using it. And people say, \"Well, they should just buy a different product.\" Well, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. You often have to buy the cheapest products. The cheapest products are often the most dangerous.And if that weren't bad enough \u2014 if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like Cancer Alley, and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use \u2014 at the point of disposal, once again, it's poor people who bear the burden. Often, we think we're doing a good thing: You're in your office, drinking your bottled water or whatever it is, and you think to yourself, \"I'm going to throw this away. No \u2014 I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin.\" You think, \"I put mine in the blue bin.\" And then you look at your colleague and say, \"Why, you cretin! You put yours in the white bin.\" And we use that as a moral tickle. We feel so good about ourselves. If we \u2014 well, OK, I'm just ... me. Not you, but I feel this way often.(Laughter)And so we kind of have this moral feel-good moment. But if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey, we would be shocked to discover that, all too often, that bottle is going to be put on a boat, it's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense, and it's going to wind up in a developing country, often China. I think in our minds, we imagine somebody's going to take the little bottle and say, \"Oh, little bottle! We're so happy to see you, little bottle.\"(Laughter)\"You've served so well.\"(Laughter)He's given a little bottle massage, a little bottle medal. And they say, \"What would you like to do next?\" The little bottle says, \"I just don't know ...\"(Laughter)But that's not actually what happens. You know? That bottle winds up getting burned. The recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic, which releases incredible toxic chemicals and, once again, kills people. And so, poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley, poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately, and then poor people who, even at the tail end of the recycling, are having their lives shortened. They're all being harmed \u2014 greatly \u2014 by this addiction that we have to disposability.Now, you think to yourself \u2014 I know how you are \u2014 you say, \"That sure is terrible for those poor people. It's just awful. Those poor people. I hope someone does something to help them.\" But what we don't understand is \u2014 here we are in Los Angeles. We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. But guess what? Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now, because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now, almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia. So we all are being hit. We all are being impacted. It's just that the poor people get it first and worst. But the dirty production, the burning of toxins, the lack of environmental standards in Asia, is actually creating so much dirty air pollution, it's coming across the ocean, and has erased our gains here in California. We're back where we were in the 1970s. And so we're on one planet, and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems.The root of this problem, in my view, is the idea of disposability itself. You see, if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people, you arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight: In order to trash the planet, you have to trash people. But if you create a world where you don't trash people, you can't trash the planet. So now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea, we finally can now see that they are really, at the end of the day, one idea. And it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything. We don't have disposable resources. We don't have disposable species. And we don't have disposable people, either. We don't have a throwaway planet, and we don't have throwaway children \u2014 it's all precious.And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding, new opportunities for action begin to emerge. Biomimicry, which is an emerging science, winds up being a very important social justice idea. People who are just learning about this stuff: biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. Democracy, by the way, means respecting the wisdom of all people \u2014 we'll get to that. But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. It turns out we're a pretty clever species. We have this big cortex, we're pretty proud of ourselves. But if we want to make something hard, we say, \"I know! I'm going to make a hard substance. I know! I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute ... But I got this hard thing!\"(Laughter)\"I'm so clever!\" And you look behind you, and there's destruction all around you. But guess what? You're so clever, but you're not as clever as a clam.A clamshell is hard. There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces. There's no poison. There's no pollution. It turns out that other species figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. That insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species \u2014 I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff. I don't mean looking at it from that way, abusing the little species. I mean actually respecting them, respecting what they've achieved. That's called biomimicry, and that opens the door to zero waste production; zero pollution production; that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life, a high standard of living, without trashing the planet.Well, that idea of biomimicry, respecting the wisdom of all species, combined with the idea of democracy and social justice, respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people, would give us a different society. We would have a different economy. We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. That should be the goal. And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about, but it even corrupts our own society.We're so proud to live here in California. We just had this vote, and everybody's like, \"Well \u2014 not in our state!\"(Laughter)I don't know what those other states were doing, but ...\"(Laughter)Just so proud. And, yeah, I'm proud, too. But ... California, though we lead the world in some of the green stuff, we also, unfortunately, lead the world in some of the gulag stuff. California has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the 50 states. We have a moral challenge in this movement. We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill, but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings, living people. And I would say that we live in a country \u2014 five percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the greenhouse gases, but also 25 percent of the world's prisoners. One of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States. So that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in.And yet, as a movement that has to broaden its constituency, that has to grow, that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone, one of the challenges to the success of this movement, of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift, is people look at our movement with some suspicion. And they ask a question, and the question is: How can these people be so passionate? A poor person, a low-income person, somebody in Cancer Alley, somebody in Watts, somebody in Harlem, somebody on an Indian reservation, might say to themselves \u2014 and rightfully so \u2014 \"How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life, or an aluminum can has a second chance, and yet, when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison, he doesn't get a second chance?\" \"How can this movement be so passionate about saying we don't have throwaway stuff, no throwaway dead materials, and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like Cancer Alley?\" And so, we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement. When we take on topics like this, it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow, and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in.Most of you are good, softhearted people. When you were younger, you cared about the whole world, and at some point, somebody said you had to pick an issue, you had to boil your love down to an issue. \"Can't love the whole world \u2014 you've got to work on trees or you've got to work on immigration. You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue.\" And really, they fundamentally told you, \"Are you going to hug a tree? Or are you going to hug a child? Pick. Are you going to hug a tree? Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.\" Well, when you start working on issues like plastic, you realize the whole thing is connected. And luckily, most of us are blessed to have two arms \u2014 we can hug both.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1056, "subtitle":

topic,\n\n00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:22.172\nwhich I think is of grave importance.\n\n00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:23.419\nWe've been talking a lot\n\n00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:29.386\nabout the horrific impacts of plastic\non the planet and on other species,\n\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.418\nbut plastic hurts people, too --\n\n00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.291\nespecially poor people.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.116\nAnd both in the production of plastic,\n\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.858\nthe use of plastic\nand the disposal of plastic,\n\n00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.447\nthe people who have\nthe bull's-eye on their foreheads\n\n00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.161\nare poor people.\n\n00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:47.262\nPeople got very upset\n\n00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:50.365\nwhen the BP oil spill happened,\n\n00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:51.849\nfor very good reason.\n\n00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:53.497\nPeople thought, \"Oh, my God.\n\n00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.297\nThis is terrible, this oil --\nit's in the water.\n\n00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:00.239\nIt's going to destroy\nthe living systems there.\n\n00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:01.697\nPeople are going to be hurt.\n\n00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.212\nThis is a terrible thing,\n\n00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.571\nthis oil is going to hurt\nthe people in the Gulf.\"\n\n00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:07.665\nWhat people don't think about is:\n\n00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.848\nWhat if the oil had made it\nsafely to shore?\n\n00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:13.133\nWhat if the oil actually got\nwhere it was trying to go?\n\n00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.769\nNot only would it have been burned\nin engines and added to global warming,\n\n00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:21.154\nbut there's a place called \"Cancer Alley,\"\n\n00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:23.313\nand the reason it's called \"Cancer Alley\"\n\n00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:25.965\nis because the petrochemical industry\n\n00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:28.145\ntakes that oil and turns it into plastic\n\n00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:30.349\nand in the process, kills people.\n\n00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:33.920\nIt shortens the lives of the people\nwho live there in the Gulf.\n\n00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:37.738\nSo oil and petrochemicals are not\njust a problem when there's a spill;\n\n00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:39.472\nthey're a problem when there's not.\n\n00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:41.903\nAnd what we don't often appreciate\n\n00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:43.601\nis the price that poor people pay\n\n00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.736\nfor us to have these disposable products.\n\n00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:48.296\nThe other thing\nwe often don't appreciate is,\n\n00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.420\nit's not just at the point of production\nthat poor people suffer.\n\n00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.617\nPoor people also suffer\nat the point of use.\n\n00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.179\nThose of us who earn\na certain income level,\n\n00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:58.144\nwe have something called choice.\n\n00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.094\nThe reason why you want\nto work hard and have a job\n\n00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:02.789\nand not be poor and broke\n\n00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:05.254\nis so you can have choices,\neconomic choices.\n\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.735\nWe actually get a chance\nto choose not to use products\n\n00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.976\nthat have dangerous,\npoisonous plastic in them.\n\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.535\nOther people who are poor\ndon't have those choices.\n\n00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.533\nSo low-income people often are the ones\n\n00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:20.541\nwho are buying the products that have\nthose dangerous chemicals in them\n\n00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:22.004\nthat their children are using.\n\n00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:25.852\nThose are the people who wind up\ningesting a disproportionate amount\n\n00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:28.043\nof this poisonous plastic in using it.\n\n00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:31.300\nAnd people say, \"Well, they should\njust buy a different product.\"\n\n00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:34.459\nWell, the problem with being poor\nis you don't have those choices.\n\n00:02:34.483 --> 00:02:36.571\nYou often have to buy\nthe cheapest products.\n\n00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:39.574\nThe cheapest products\nare often the most dangerous.\n\n00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:41.194\nAnd if that weren't bad enough --\n\n00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:44.639\nif it wasn't just the production\nof plastic that's giving people cancer\n\n00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.167\nin places like Cancer Alley,\n\n00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.699\nand shortening lives and hurting\npoor kids at the point of use --\n\n00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:51.806\nat the point of disposal,\n\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.088\nonce again, it's poor people\nwho bear the burden.\n\n00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.065\nOften, we think we're doing a good thing:\n\n00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.737\nYou're in your office, drinking\nyour bottled water or whatever it is,\n\n00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:04.520\nand you think to yourself,\n\"I'm going to throw this away.\n\n00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:08.074\nNo -- I'm going to be virtuous.\nI'm going to put it in the blue bin.\"\n\n00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:10.130\nYou think, \"I put mine in the blue bin.\"\n\n00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:13.718\nAnd then you look\nat your colleague and say,\n\n00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:16.856\n\"Why, you cretin!\nYou put yours in the white bin.\"\n\n00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:19.504\nAnd we use that as a moral tickle.\n\n00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:21.273\nWe feel so good about ourselves.\n\n00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:24.552\nIf we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.\n\n00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:26.276\nNot you, but I feel this way often.\n\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.849\nAnd so we kind of have\nthis moral feel-good moment.\n\n00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:34.084\nBut if we were to be able\nto follow that little bottle\n\n00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:36.139\non its journey,\n\n00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:38.728\nwe would be shocked\nto discover that, all too often,\n\n00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:41.082\nthat bottle is going to be put on a boat,\n\n00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:44.184\nit's going to go all the way\nacross the ocean\n\n00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:46.160\nat some expense,\n\n00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.703\nand it's going to wind up\nin a developing country, often China.\n\n00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:51.315\nI think in our minds, we imagine\n\n00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.799\nsomebody's going to take\nthe little bottle

There's no pollution.\n\n00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:09.875\nIt turns out that other species\nfigured out a long time ago\n\n00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:12.234\nhow to create many of the things we

species,\n\n00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:54.796\ncombined with the idea\nof democracy and social justice,\n\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.415\nrespecting the wisdom\nand the worth of all

there\nis to first of all recognize\n\n00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.667\nthat the idea of disposability\n\n00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:17.634\nnot only hurts the species\nwe've talked about,\n\n00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:20.409\nbut it even corrupts our own society.\n\n00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:23.410\nWe're so proud to live here in California.\n\n00:09:23.434 --> 00:09:25.520\nWe just had this vote,\nand

00:09:39.566\nBut ...\n\n00:09:41.118 --> 00:09:44.634\nCalifornia, though we lead the world\nin some of the green stuff,\n\n00:09:44.658 --> 00:09:46.634\nwe also, unfortunately, lead the world\n\n00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:48.198\nin some of the gulag stuff.\n\n00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:52.904\nCalifornia has one of the highest\nincarceration rates\n\n00:09:52.928 --> 00:09:54.634\nof all

would say\nthat we live in a country --\n\n00:10:10.515 --> 00:10:12.492\nfive percent of the world's population,\n\n00:10:12.516 --> 00:10:14.382\n25 percent of the greenhouse gases,\n\n00:10:15.030

up right here\nin the United States.\n\n00:10:22.924 --> 00:10:25.634\nSo that is consistent with this idea\n\n00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.294\nthat disposability\nis something we believe in.\n\n00:10:28.874 --> 00:10:30.033\nAnd yet,\n\n00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:35.720\nas a movement that has to broaden\nits constituency,\n\n00:10:35.744 --> 00:10:37.055\nthat has to

It's really a huge challenge for us. And this is our beast of burden \u2014 this is a Computer Tomography machine, a CT machine. It's a fantastic device. It uses X-rays, X-ray beams, that are rotating very fast around the human body. It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine. So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care, but as I said, it's also a challenge for us. And the challenge is really found in this picture here. It's the medical data explosion that we're having right now. We're facing this problem. And let me step back in time.Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. These machines that came out \u2014 they started coming in the 1970s \u2014 they would scan human bodies, and they would generate about 100 images of the human body. And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity, to translate that to data slices. That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data, which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices. If you translate that to phone books, it's about one meter of phone books in the pile. Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have, we can, just in a few seconds, get 24,000 images out of a body, and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data, or 800 phone books, and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books. What's about to happen \u2014 and we're seeing this; it's beginning \u2014 a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well. So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds, and that would correspond to one terabyte of data \u2014 that's 800,000 books and 16 kilometers of phone books. That's one patient, one data set. And this is what we have to deal with.So this is really the enormous challenge that we have. And already today \u2014 this is 25,000 images. Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this. They would put up 25,000 images, they would go like this, \"25,0000, okay, okay. There is the problem.\" They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this. So what we do is that we put all these slices together. Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions, and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data, into a block of data. So this is really what we're doing. So this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block. But of course, the block of data just contains the amount of X-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body. So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at. So transforming the data set into something that looks like this. And this is a challenge. This is a huge challenge for us to do that.Using computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time, it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data, terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information. I want to look at the heart. I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver. Maybe even find a tumor, in some cases. So this is where this little dear comes into play. This is my daughter. This is as of 9 a.m. this morning. She's playing a computer game. She's only two years old, and she's having a blast. So she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics-processing units. As long as kids are playing computer games, graphics is getting better and better and better. So please go back home, tell your kids to play more games, because that's what I need.So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data. So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices. And you know, going back maybe 10 years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer \u2014 it was a huge machine. It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything. I paid about one million dollars for that machine. That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone. So every month there are new graphics cards coming out, and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors \u2014 NVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well. And you know, for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer, and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine, together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms \u2014 compressing data, extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do. This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner. You can see that this is a full data [set]. It's a woman. You can see the hair. You can see the individual structures of the woman. You can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays on the teeth, the metal in the teeth. That's where those artifacts are coming from. But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer, I can just put in a clip plane. And of course all the data is inside, so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles, and I can see that this woman had a problem. She had a bleeding up in the brain, and that's been fixed with a little stent, a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel. And just by changing the functions, then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible. I can look at the skull structure, and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman, and that's where they went in. So these are fantastic images. They're really high resolution, and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today.Now we have really made use of this, and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system. And one of the applications that we've been working on \u2014 and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide \u2014 is the application of virtual autopsies. So again, looking at very, very large data sets, and you saw those full-body scans that we can do. We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner, and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set. So this is from a virtual autopsy. And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off. First you saw the body bag that the body came in, then I'm peeling off the skin \u2014 you can see the muscles \u2014 and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.Now at this point, I would also like to emphasize that, with the greatest respect for the people that I'm now going to show \u2014 I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies \u2014 so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you. In the forensic case \u2014 and this is something that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years. So this will be the typical workflow situation. The police will decide \u2014 in the evening, when there's a case coming in \u2014 they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy? So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning, the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners. And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist, looks at the data that's coming out, and they have a joint session. And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.Now looking at a few cases, here's one of the first cases that we had. You can really see the details of the data set. It's very high-resolution, and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details. And again, it's fully interactive, so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here. Without saying too much about this case, this is a traffic accident, a drunk driver hit a woman. And it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure. And the cause of death is the broken neck. And this women also ended up under the car, so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury.Here's another case, a knifing. And this is also again showing us what we can do. It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body. You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth \u2014 that's actually the filling of the teeth \u2014 but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent. Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person. The person was killed by stabs in the heart, but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. Here's another case. It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings. Here you can see that knife went through the heart. It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part, which is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy. So it really, really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death, and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was.Here's another case that I think is interesting. Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person. And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source, so that bullet is actually shining, and it makes it really easy to find these fragments. During a physical autopsy, if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments, that's actually quite hard to do.One of the things that I'm really, really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table. It's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs. It actually looks like this, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. It really just works like a huge iPhone. So we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table, and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface. So if you were thinking of buying an iPad, forget about it. This is what you want instead. Steve, I hope you're listening to this, all right. So it's a very nice little device. So if you have the opportunity, please try it out. It's really a hands-on experience. So it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes, but also, perhaps in the future, in a more clinical situation. There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this, if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies.Okay, now that we're talking about touch, let me move on to really \"touching\" data. And this is a bit of science fiction now, so we're moving into really the future. This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now, but I hope they will in the future. So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device. It's a little mechanical pen that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen. And so I can generate a force feedback. So when I virtually touch data, it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback. So in this particular situation, it's a scan of a living person. I have this pen, and I look at the data, and I move the pen towards the head, and all of a sudden I feel resistance. So I can feel the skin. If I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin, and I can feel the bone structure inside. If I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure, especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft. And then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.So this is really nice. And to take that even further, this is a heart. And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners, that just in 0.3 seconds, I can scan the whole heart, and I can do that with time resolution. So just looking at this heart, I can play back a video here. And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students who's been working on this project. And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system, and he's moving his pen towards the heart, and the heart is now beating in front of him, so he can see how the heart is beating. He's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart, and he's putting it on the heart, and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient. Then he can examine how the heart is moving. He can go inside, push inside of the heart, and really feel how the valves are moving. And this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons. I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery, and do that with high-quality resolution data. So this is really neat.Now we're going even further into science fiction. And we heard a little bit about functional MRI. Now this is really an interesting project. MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain, or any part of the body. So what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain, but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen. That means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain. So this is something that we've been working on. And you just saw Motts the research engineer, there, going into the MRI system, and he was wearing goggles. So he could actually see things in the goggles. So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner. And this is a little bit freaky, because what Motts is seeing is actually this. He's seeing his own brain. So Motts is doing something here, and probably he is going like this with his right hand, because the left side is activated on the motor cortex. And then he can see that at the same time. These visualizations are brand new. And this is something that we've been researching for a little while.This is another sequence of Motts' brain. And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100. So he's going \"100, 97, 94.\" And then he's going backwards. And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain. Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things. You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head, because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain. And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things. The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well, and it's shining through, because all of the data is inside this volume. And in just a second here you will see \u2014 okay, here. Motts, now move your left foot. So he's going like this. For 20 seconds he's going like that, and all of a sudden it lights up up here. So we've got motor cortex activation up there. So this is really, really nice, and I think this is a great tool. And connecting also with the previous talk here, this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working, how the brain is working, and we can do this with very, very high visual quality and very fast resolution.Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center. So this is a CAT scan \u2014 Computer Aided Tomography. So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa. So she came to the center, and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner. And then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion. And I can do very nice images like this. I can peel off the layer of the lion. I can look inside of it. And we've been experimenting with this. And I think this is a great application for the future of this technology, because there's very little known about the animal anatomy. What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information. We can scan all sorts of things, all sorts of animals. The only problem is to fit it into the machine. So here's a bear. It was kind of hard to get it in. And the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal. And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear. And you might want to cuddle this one, until you change the functions and look at this. So be aware of the bear.So with that, I'd like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images. It's a huge effort that goes into doing this, gathering the data and developing the algorithms, writing all the software. So, some very talented people. My motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am and most of these are smarter than I am.So thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1057, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthe challenge of dealing with data,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\ndata that we have to deal with\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nin medical situations.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nIt's really a huge challenge for us.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd this is our beast of burden --\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthis is a Computer Tomography machine,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\na CT machine.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nIt's a fantastic device.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nIt uses X-rays, X-ray beams,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nthat are rotating very fast around the human body.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nIt takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nand is generating enormous amounts of information\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthat comes out of the machine.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nSo this is a fantastic machine\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthat we can use\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nfor improving health care,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nbut as I said, it's also a challenge for us.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd the challenge is really found in this picture here.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nIt's the medical data explosion\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nthat we're having right now.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nWe're facing this problem.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd let me step back in time.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nLet's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThese machines that came out --\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthey started coming in the 1970s --\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthey would scan human bodies,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand they would generate about 100 images\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nof the human body.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd I've taken the liberty, just for clarity,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nto translate that to data slices.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThat would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwhich is small\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwhen you think about the data we can handle today\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\njust on normal mobile devices.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nIf you translate that to phone books,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nit's about one meter of phone books in the pile.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nLooking at what we're doing today\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nwith these machines that we have,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nwe can, just in a few seconds,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nget 24,000 images out of a body,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nor 800 phone books,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nand the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWhat's about to happen --\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand we're seeing this; it's beginning --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\na technology trend that's happening right now\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nis that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nSo we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd just assume\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthat we will be collecting data during five seconds,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand that would correspond to one terabyte of data --\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat's 800,000 books\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nand 16 kilometers of phone books.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nThat's one patient, one data set.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd this is what we have to deal with.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nSo this is really the enormous challenge that we have.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nAnd already today -- this is 25,000 images.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nImagine the days\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwhen we had radiologists doing this.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThey would put up 25,000 images,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthey would go like this, \"25,0000, okay, okay.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nThere is the problem.\"\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey can't do that anymore. That's impossible.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSo we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSo what we do is that we put all these slices together.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nImagine that you slice your body in all these directions,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand then you try to put the slices back together again\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\ninto a pile of data, into a block of data.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nSo this is really what we're doing.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nBut of course, the block of data\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\njust contains the amount of X-ray\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat's been absorbed in each point in the human body.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo what we need to do is to figure out a way\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nof looking at the things we do want to look at\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand make things transparent that we don't want to look at.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSo transforming the data set\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\ninto something that looks like this.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd this is a challenge.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThis is a huge challenge for us to do that.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nUsing computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nit's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nterabytes of data\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand extracting the relevant information.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nI want to look at the heart.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nI want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nMaybe even find a tumor,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nin some cases.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo this is where this little dear comes into play.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nThis is my daughter.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis is as of 9 a.m. this morning.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nShe's playing a computer game.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nShe's only two years old,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand she's having a blast.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nSo she's really the driving force\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbehind the development of graphics-processing units.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAs long as kids are playing computer games,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\ngraphics is getting better and better and better.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo please go back home, tell your kids to play more games,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nbecause that's what I need.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo what's inside of this machine\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nis what enables me to do the things that I'm doing\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwith the medical data.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nSo really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd you know, going back\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nmaybe 10 years in time\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwhen I got the funding\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nto buy my first graphics computer --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nit was a huge machine.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIt was cabinets of processors and storage and everything.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI paid about one million dollars for that machine.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThat machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo every month there are new graphics cards coming out,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors --\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nNVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd you know, for a few hundred bucks\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nyou can get these things and put them into your computer,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo this is really what's enabling us\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nto deal with the explosion of data in medicine,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\ntogether with some really nifty work\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nin terms of algorithms --\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\ncompressing data,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nextracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThis is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nYou can see that this is a full data [set].\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIt's a woman. You can see the hair.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nYou can see the individual structures of the woman.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nYou can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\non the teeth, the metal in the teeth.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nThat's where those artifacts are coming from.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nBut fully interactively\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\non standard graphics cards on a normal computer,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nI can just put in a clip plane.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd of course all the data is inside,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nso I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand I can see that this woman had a problem.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nShe had a bleeding up in the brain,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand that's been fixed with a little stent,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\na metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd just by changing the functions,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthen I can decide what's going to be transparent\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand what's going to be visible.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nI can look at the skull structure,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand that's where they went in.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo these are fantastic images.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThey're really high resolution,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand they're really showing us what we can do\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nwith standard graphics cards today.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nNow we have really made use of this,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand we have tried to squeeze a lot of data\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\ninto the system.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd one of the applications that we've been working on --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nis the application of virtual autopsies.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nSo again, looking at very, very large data sets,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand you saw those full-body scans that we can do.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nWe're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nSo this is from a virtual autopsy.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd you can see how I'm gradually peeling off.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nFirst you saw the body bag that the body came in,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthen I'm peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles --\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nNow at this point, I would also like to emphasize\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat, with the greatest respect\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nfor the people that I'm now going to show --\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nI'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nso it's with great respect for the people\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthat have died under violent circumstances\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthat I'm showing these pictures to you.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIn the forensic case --\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand this is something\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nthat ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\njust in the part of Sweden that I come from\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat has been undergoing virtual autopsies\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nin the past four years.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo this will be the typical workflow situation.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nThe police will decide --\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nin the evening, when there's a case coming in --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthey will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthe body is then transported inside of the body bag\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nto our center\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd then the radiologist, together with the pathologist\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nand sometimes the forensic scientist,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nlooks at the data that's coming out,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand they have a joint session.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nNow looking at a few cases,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nhere's one of the first cases that we had.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nYou can really see the details of the data set.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIt's very high-resolution,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand it's our algorithms that allow us\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto zoom in on all the details.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd again, it's fully interactive,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nso you can rotate and you can look at things in real time\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\non these systems here.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nWithout saying too much about this case,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthis is a traffic accident,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\na drunk driver hit a woman.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnd the cause of death is the broken neck.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd this women also ended up under the car,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nso she's quite badly beaten up\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nby this injury.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHere's another case, a knifing.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd this is also again showing us what we can do.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nIt's very easy to look at metal artifacts\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthat we can show inside of the body.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nYou can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthat's actually the filling of the teeth --\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbut because I've set the functions to show me metal\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand make everything else transparent.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nHere's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThe person was killed by stabs in the heart,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbut they just deposited the knife\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nby putting it through one of the eyeballs.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nHere's another case.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIt's very interesting for us\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nto be able to look at things like knife stabbings.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nHere you can see that knife went through the heart.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nIt's very easy to see how air has been leaking\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nfrom one part to another part,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwhich is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo it really, really helps\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthe criminal investigation\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto establish the cause of death,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nto find out who the killer really was.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nHere's another case that I think is interesting.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nHere you can see a bullet\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthat has lodged just next to the spine on this person.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nso that bullet is actually shining,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand it makes it really easy to find these fragments.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDuring a physical autopsy,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nif you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthat's actually quite hard to do.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nOne of the things that I'm really, really happy\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nto be able to show you here today\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nis our virtual autopsy table.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIt's a touch device that we have developed\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nbased on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIt actually looks like this,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\njust to give you a feeling for what it looks like.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIt really just works like a huge iPhone.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nSo we've implemented\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nall the gestures you can do on the table,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nand you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo if you were thinking of buying an iPad,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nforget about it. This is what you want instead.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSteve, I hope you're listening to this, all right.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo it's a very nice little device.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nSo if you have the opportunity, please try it out.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nIt's really a hands-on experience.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nSo it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand trying to use it for educational purposes,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nbut also, perhaps in the future,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nin a more clinical situation.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nThere's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nif you want to convey the information to other people\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nabout virtual autopsies.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nOkay, now that we're talking about touch,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nlet me move on to really \"touching\" data.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd this is a bit of science fiction now,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nso we're moving into really the future.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThis is not really what the medical doctors are using right now,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nbut I hope they will in the future.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nSo what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIt's a little mechanical pen\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nthat has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd so I can generate a force feedback.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo when I virtually touch data,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nit will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nSo in this particular situation,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nit's a scan of a living person.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI have this pen, and I look at the data,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand I move the pen towards the head,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand all of a sudden I feel resistance.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nSo I can feel the skin.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIf I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand I can feel the bone structure inside.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIf I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nespecially close to the ear where the bone is very soft.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nSo this is really nice.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd to take that even further, this is a heart.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd this is also due to these fantastic new scanners,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthat just in 0.3 seconds,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI can scan the whole heart,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand I can do that with time resolution.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo just looking at this heart,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI can play back a video here.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwho's been working on this project.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nand he's moving his pen towards the heart,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand the heart is now beating in front of him,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nso he can see how the heart is beating.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nHe's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand he's putting it on the heart,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nand then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThen he can examine how the heart is moving.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nHe can go inside, push inside of the heart,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand really feel how the valves are moving.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nI mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nto be able to go inside of the patient's heart\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nbefore you actually do surgery,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand do that with high-quality resolution data.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nSo this is really neat.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nNow we're going even further into science fiction.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd we heard a little bit about functional MRI.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nNow this is really an interesting project.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nMRI is using magnetic fields\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand radio frequencies\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nto scan the brain, or any part of the body.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo what we're really getting out of this\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nis information of the structure of the brain,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbut we can also measure the difference\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nin magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand blood that's depleted of oxygen.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThat means that it's possible\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nto map out the activity of the brain.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nSo this is something that we've been working on.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd you just saw Motts the research engineer, there,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\ngoing into the MRI system,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nand he was wearing goggles.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSo he could actually see things in the goggles.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nSo I could present things to him while he's in the scanner.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd this is a little bit freaky,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nbecause what Motts is seeing is actually this.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nHe's seeing his own brain.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nSo Motts is doing something here,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand probably he is going like this with his right hand,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nbecause the left side is activated\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\non the motor cortex.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd then he can see that at the same time.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThese visualizations are brand new.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd this is something that we've been researching for a little while.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nThis is another sequence of Motts' brain.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo he's going \"100, 97, 94.\"\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nAnd then he's going backwards.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nAnd you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand is lighting up the whole brain.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nWell this is fantastic. We can do this in real time.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nWe can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nYou can also see that his visual cortex\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nis activated in the back of the head,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nbecause that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd he's also hearing our instructions\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwhen we tell him to do things.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nThe signal is really deep inside of the brain as well,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand it's shining through,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nbecause all of the data is inside this volume.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd in just a second here you will see --\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nokay, here. Motts, now move your left foot.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo he's going like this.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nFor 20 seconds he's going like that,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand all of a sudden it lights up up here.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo we've got motor cortex activation up there.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nSo this is really, really nice,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand I think this is a great tool.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd connecting also with the previous talk here,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthis is something that we could use as a tool\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nto really understand\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nhow the neurons are working, how the brain is working,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand we can do this with very, very high visual quality\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nand very fast resolution.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nNow we're also having a bit of fun at the center.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo this is a CAT scan -- Computer Aided Tomography.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nSo this is a lion from the local zoo\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\noutside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo she came to the center,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand they sedated her\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nand then put her straight into the scanner.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd I can do very nice images like this.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nI can peel off the layer of the lion.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nI can look inside of it.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd we've been experimenting with this.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nAnd I think this is a great application\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nfor the future of this technology,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nbecause there's very little known about the animal anatomy.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nWhat's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWe can scan all sorts of things,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nall sorts of animals.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThe only problem is to fit it into the machine.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSo here's a bear.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nIt was kind of hard to get it in.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd you might want to cuddle this one,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nuntil you change the functions and look at this.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nSo be aware of the bear.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nSo with that,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nI'd like to thank all the people\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nwho have helped me to generate these images.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nIt's a huge effort that goes into doing this,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\ngathering the data and developing the algorithms,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nwriting all the software.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nSo, some very talented people.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nMy motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand most of these are smarter than I am.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nSo thank you very much.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Silicon-based comedy", "duration": "364", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/heather_knight_silicon_based_comedy", "transcript": "Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields. So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment, which is entertainment and robotics. So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot, I would like to use art to create tech.(Laughter)So we're based in New York City. And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot, or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation, please contact me, the Bot-Agent. The bot, our rising celebrity, also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild. I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data. He's named after the Star Trek character. I think he's going to be super popular. We've got the robot \u2014 in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length. It knows how much it's moving. And so it's going to try to watch your response. I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.(Laughter)It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures. You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions. Some of you in this middle section \u2014 you have red/green paddles. If you like what's going on, show the green. If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red. Now don't be shy. It's just a robot. It doesn't have feelings ... yet. (Laughter) And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter. There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing \u2014 I hope not \u2014 to help make some of its next decisions. Right, so, let the robot stand-up comedy begin.Data: Hello TEDWomen. It's an honor to be here.(Laughter)(Applause)You guys are looking good out there. Ready for some jokes?Audience: Yeah.Data: Here's the first one. Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, \"I have bad news and worse news. The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live.\" \"That's terrible,\" said the patient. \"How can the news possibly be worse?\" \"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday.\"(Laughter)(Applause)The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss. Data: Pretty lucky for them. Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with? \"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here. You get past me, the guy behind me has a spoon.\"(Laughter)HK: He's a French robot.Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods. One of them falls to the ground. He does not seem to be breathing. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. He gasps to the operator, \"My friend is dead. What can I do?\" The operator says, \"Just take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead.\" There is a silence, and the operator hears a shot. The guy's voice comes back on the line, \"Okay, now what?\"(Laughter)(Applause)Question: Why is television called a medium? Anyone? Because it's neither rare nor well done. But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television. Any of you like television? Audience: Yes. Data: I find it incredibly educational. Actually, as soon as someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read. (Laughter) That's all for now. Was that okay for my first time?(Applause)You've been a great audience. Thank you.HK: Yay.(Applause)So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. So thank you all for being a part of it. There's a lot more to come.

If you look at the chart at the top here, you'll see that in 2025, these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And if you look at the chart for 2050, it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy, and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis.A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. Goldman Sachs projected 2027. The post-crisis projection is 2020. That's just a decade away. China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. First of all, it's a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people, which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year.And within a decade, it will have the largest economy in the world. Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country, rather than a developed country. Secondly, for the first time in the modern era, the dominant country in the world \u2014 which I think is what China will become \u2014 will be not from the West and from very, very different civilizational roots.Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize, they also westernize. This is an illusion. It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology. It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. China is not like the West, and it will not become like the West. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. Now the big question here is obviously, how do we make sense of China? How do we try to understand what China is? And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large, is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms, using Western ideas. We can't. Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like, just as a beginning.The first is this: that China is not really a nation-state. Okay, it's called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years, but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period \u2014 the birth of modern China. And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty, still 2,000 years ago. And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China, which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now.Now what is extraordinary about this is, what gives China its sense of being China, what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese, comes not from the last hundred years, not from the nation-state period, which is what happened in the West, but from the period, if you like, of the civilization-state. I'm thinking here, for example, of customs like ancestral worship, of a very distinctive notion of the state, likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family, social relationships like guanxi, Confucian values and so on. These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state. In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world, is shaped by its sense of civilization, its existence as a civilization-state, rather than as a nation-state. And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people. What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic, and in many ways very decentralized. You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing, even though we think this to be the case. It's never been the case.So this is China, a civilization-state, rather than a nation-state. And what does it mean? Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications. I'll give you two quick ones. The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity, is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe: breakdown \u2014 the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. It divided, and it's remained divided ever since. China, over the same time period, went in exactly the opposite direction, very painfully holding this huge civilization, civilization-state, together.The second is maybe more prosaic, which is Hong Kong. Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997? You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was. One country, two systems. And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them. \"Window dressing. When China gets its hands on Hong Kong, that won't be the case.\" Thirteen years on, the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997. We were wrong. Why were we wrong? We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough, in nation-state ways. Think of German unification, 1990. What happened? Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West. One nation, one system. That is the nation-state mentality. But you can't run a country like China, a civilization-state, on the basis of one civilization, one system. It doesn't work. So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong \u2014 as it will be to the question of Taiwan \u2014 was a natural response: one civilization, many systems.Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China \u2014 maybe not sort of a comfortable one. The Chinese have a very, very different conception of race to most other countries. Do you know, of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han? Now, this is completely different from the world's [other] most populous countries. India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil \u2014 all of them are multiracial. The Chinese don't feel like that. China is only multiracial really at the margins. So the question is, why? Well the reason, I think, essentially is, again, back to the civilization-state. A history of at least 2,000 years, a history of conquest, occupation, absorption, assimilation and so on, led to the process by which, over time, this notion of the Han emerged \u2014 of course, nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity.Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that, without the Han, China could never have held together. The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. They really believe in their own superiority, and they are disrespectful of those who are not. Hence their attitude, for example, to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.Or let me give you my third building block, the Chinese state. Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think \u2014 in these days at least \u2014 that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. And the reason for this is because \u2014 well, there are two reasons, I think. And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy, because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. And the reason for this is, firstly, because the state in China is given a very special \u2014 it enjoys a very special significance as the representative, the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization, of the civilization-state. This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role.And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged \u2014 I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on \u2014 for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. It's had no serious rivals. So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder, a stranger, certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained, the Chinese don't see the state like that at all. The Chinese view the state as an intimate \u2014 not just as an intimate actually, as a member of the family \u2014 not just in fact as a member of the family, but as the head of the family, the patriarch of the family. This is the Chinese view of the state \u2014 very, very different to ours. It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West.And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here, in the Chinese context, is a new kind of paradigm, which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past. Know that China believes in the market and the state. I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, \"The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe.\" And, apart from the Mao period, that has remained more or less the case ever since. But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. The state is everywhere in China. I mean, it's leading firms \u2014 many of them are still publicly owned. Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo, depend in many ways on state patronage. Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state. And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas \u2014 as we are familiar with \u2014 with something like the one-child policy.Moreover, this is a very old state tradition, a very old tradition of statecraft. I mean, if you want an illustration of this, the Great Wall is one. But this is another, this is the Grand Canal, which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D. It went for 1,114 miles, linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai. So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China, which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today, which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China \u2014 the civilization-state, the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society.And yet we still insist, by and large, in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience, looking at it through Western eyes, using Western concepts. If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong \u2014 our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect \u2014 this is the reason. Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. It's kind of arrogant. It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure. And secondly, it's ignorant. We refuse to really address the issue of difference. You know, there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian. And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures. But it's not. In many ways, it's the most parochial, because for 200 years, the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures, other civilizations. Because, at the end of the day, it could, if necessary by force, get its own way. Whereas those cultures \u2014 virtually the rest of the world, in fact, which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West \u2014 have been thereby forced to understand the West, because of the West's presence in those societies. And therefore, they are, as a result, more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.I mean, take the question of East Asia. East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. \u2014 a third of the world's population lives there. Now the largest economic region in the world. And I'll tell you now, that East Asianers, people from East Asia, are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid, to the present. Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning, the Goldman Sachs chart. What is happening is that, very rapidly in historical terms, the world is being driven and shaped, not by the old developed countries, but by the developing world. We've seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7, or the G8. And there are two consequences of this. First, the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago \u2014 Copenhagen, climate change conference. Europe was not at the final negotiating table. When did that last happen? I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago. And that is what is going to happen in the future.And the second implication is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence, become increasingly unfamiliar to us, because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with, or conversant with. And at last, I'm afraid \u2014 take Europe; America is slightly different \u2014 but Europeans by and large, I have to say, are ignorant, are unaware about the way the world is changing. Some people \u2014 I've got an English friend in China, and he said, \"The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.\" Well, maybe that's true, maybe that's an exaggeration. But there's another problem which goes along with this \u2014 that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world \u2014 and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence. Take the 19th century, for example. But this, alas, is no longer true.If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future, try China \u2014 there's old Confucius. This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before. It doesn't even look like a railway station. This is the new [Wuhan] railway station for the high-speed trains. China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people. It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it. And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour. Now this is the way things are going to move, because China has a very specific problem, which is different from Europe and different from the United States: China has huge numbers of people and no space. So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many, many, many cities over 20 million people.Okay, so how would I like to finish? Well, what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us? I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it. But I want to argue, above all, a big-picture positive for this world. For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. That's what Europe and North America represented. The arrival of countries like China and India \u2014 between them 38 percent of the world's population \u2014 and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on, represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years. Civilizations and cultures, which had been ignored, which had no voice, which were not listened to, which were not known about, will have a different sort of representation in this world. As humanists, we must welcome, surely, this transformation, and we will have to learn about these civilizations.This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea, the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. The little boat in front of it was the one in which, 80 years later, Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic. (Laughter) Or, look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368.

It is also shaped equally\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nby history and culture.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nChina is not like the West,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand it will not become like the West.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIt will remain in very fundamental respects\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nvery different.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nNow the big question here is obviously,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nhow do we make sense of China?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nHow do we try to understand what China is?\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nis that the conventional approach\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nis that we understand it really in Western terms,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nusing Western ideas.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nWe can't.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nNow I want to offer you\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthree building blocks\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nfor trying to understand what China is like,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\njust as a beginning.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nThe first is this:\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat China is not really a nation-state.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nOkay, it's called itself a nation-state\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nfor the last hundred years,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut everyone who knows anything about China\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nknows it's a lot older than this.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThis was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nin 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthe birth of modern China.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nOr immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nstill 2,000 years ago.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd you can see already it occupies\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nmost of what we now know as Eastern China,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nwhich is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand live now.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nNow what is extraordinary about this\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis, what gives China its sense of being China,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhat gives the Chinese\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthe sense of what it is to be Chinese,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\ncomes not from the last hundred years,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nnot from the nation-state period,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhich is what happened in the West,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nbut from the period, if you like,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nof the civilization-state.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nI'm thinking here, for example,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nof customs like ancestral worship,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nof a very distinctive notion of the state,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nlikewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nsocial relationships like guanxi,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nConfucian values and so on.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThese are all things that come\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nfrom the period of the civilization-state.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIn other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nis shaped by its sense of civilization,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nits existence as a civilization-state,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nrather than as a nation-state.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nOf course we know China's big, huge,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\ndemographically and geographically,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwith a population of 1.3 billion people.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nWhat we often aren't really aware of\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nis the fact\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthat China is extremely diverse\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand very pluralistic,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand in many ways very decentralized.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nYou can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\neven though we think this to be the case.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nIt's never been the case.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nSo this is China, a civilization-state,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nrather than a nation-state.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd what does it mean?\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nWell, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI'll give you two quick ones.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThe first is that\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthe most important political value for the Chinese\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nis unity,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nis the maintenance\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nof Chinese civilization.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nYou know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nbreakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt divided, and it's remained divided ever since.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nChina, over the same time period,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwent in exactly the opposite direction,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nvery painfully holding this huge civilization,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\ncivilization-state, together.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nThe second\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nis maybe more prosaic,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhich is Hong Kong.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nDo you remember the handover of Hong Kong\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nby Britain to China in 1997?\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nYou may remember\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nwhat the Chinese constitutional proposition was.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nOne country, two systems.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd I'll lay a wager\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthat barely anyone in the West believed them.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n\"Window dressing.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nWhen China gets its hands on Hong Kong,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nthat won't be the case.\"\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nThirteen years on,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthe political and legal system in Hong Kong\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nis as different now as it was in 1997.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nWe were wrong. Why were we wrong?\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWe were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nin nation-state ways.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nThink of German unification, 1990.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWhat happened?\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nWell, basically the East was swallowed by the West.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nOne nation, one system.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThat is the nation-state mentality.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nBut you can't run a country like China,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\na civilization-state,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\non the basis of one civilization, one system.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIt doesn't work.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo actually the response of China\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nto the question of Hong Kong --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nas it will be to the question of Taiwan --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwas a natural response:\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\none civilization, many systems.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nLet me offer you another building block\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nto try and understand China --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nmaybe not sort of a comfortable one.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThe Chinese have a very, very different\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nconception of race\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nto most other countries.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nDo you know,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nof the 1.3 billion Chinese,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nover 90 percent of them\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthink they belong to the same race,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthe Han?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nNow, this is completely different\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nfrom the world's [other] most populous countries.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIndia, the United States,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIndonesia, Brazil --\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nall of them are multiracial.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nThe Chinese don't feel like that.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nChina is only multiracial\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nreally at the margins.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo the question is, why?\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nWell the reason, I think, essentially\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nis, again, back to the civilization-state.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nA history of at least 2,000 years,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\na history of conquest, occupation,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nabsorption, assimilation and so on,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nled to the process by which,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nover time, this notion of the Han emerged --\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nof course, nurtured\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nby a growing and very powerful sense\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nof cultural identity.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nNow the great advantage of this historical experience\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nhas been that, without the Han,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nChina could never have held together.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThe Han identity has been the cement\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nwhich has held this country together.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThe great disadvantage of it\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nis that the Han have a very weak conception\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nof cultural difference.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThey really believe\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nin their own superiority,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand they are disrespectful\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nof those who are not.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHence their attitude, for example,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nto the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nOr let me give you my third building block,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nthe Chinese state.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nNow the relationship\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nbetween the state and society in China\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nis very different from that in the West.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nNow we in the West\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\noverwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthat the authority and legitimacy of the state\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nis a function of democracy.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThe problem with this proposition\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nis that the Chinese state\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nenjoys more legitimacy\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand more authority\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\namongst the Chinese\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthan is true\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwith any Western state.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd the reason for this\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nis because --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwell, there are two reasons, I think.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAnd it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nbecause in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd the reason for this is,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nfirstly, because the state in China\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nis given a very special --\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nit enjoys a very special significance\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nas the representative,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nthe embodiment and the guardian\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nof Chinese civilization,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nof the civilization-state.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nThis is as close as China gets\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nto a kind of spiritual role.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd the second reason is because,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwhereas in Europe\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand North America,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthe state's power is continuously challenged --\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nI mean in the European tradition,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nhistorically against the church,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nagainst other sectors of the aristocracy,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nagainst merchants and so on --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nfor 1,000 years,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthe power of the Chinese state\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nhas not been challenged.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nIt's had no serious rivals.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nSo you can see\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthat the way in which power has been constructed in China\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nis very different from our experience\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nin Western history.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe result, by the way,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nis that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nWhereas we tend to view it as an intruder,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\na stranger,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\ncertainly an organ\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nwhose powers need to be limited\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nor defined and constrained,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthe Chinese don't see the state like that at all.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe Chinese view the state\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nas an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nas a member of the family --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nnot just in fact as a member of the family,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nbut as the head of the family,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nthe patriarch of the family.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThis is the Chinese view of the state --\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nvery, very different to ours.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt's embedded in society in a different kind of way\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nto what is the case\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nin the West.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nin the Chinese context,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nis a new kind of paradigm,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nwhich is different from anything\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nwe've had to think about in the past.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nKnow that China believes in the market and the state.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nI mean, Adam Smith,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nalready writing in the late 18th century, said,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\n\"The Chinese market is larger and more developed\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand more sophisticated\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthan anything in Europe.\"\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd, apart from the Mao period,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nthat has remained more or less the case ever since.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nBut this is combined\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwith an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThe state is everywhere in China.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nI mean, it's leading firms --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nmany of them are still publicly owned.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nPrivate firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\ndepend in many ways on state patronage.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nTargets for the economy and so on\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nare set by the state.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAnd the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nas we are familiar with --\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwith something like the one-child policy.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nMoreover, this is a very old state tradition,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\na very old tradition of statecraft.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI mean, if you want an illustration of this,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthe Great Wall is one.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nBut this is another, this is the Grand Canal,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwhich was constructed in the first instance\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nin the fifth century B.C.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand was finally completed\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nin the seventh century A.D.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nIt went for 1,114 miles,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nlinking Beijing\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwith Hangzhou and Shanghai.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nSo there's a long history\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof extraordinary state infrastructural projects\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin China,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhich I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhich is something like the Three Gorges Dam\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nand many other expressions\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nof state competence\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwithin China.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo there we have three building blocks\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nfor trying to understand the difference that is China --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthe civilization-state,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nthe notion of race\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand the nature of the state\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nand its relationship to society.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nAnd yet we still insist, by and large,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nin thinking that we can understand China\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nby simply drawing on Western experience,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nlooking at it through Western eyes,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nusing Western concepts.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nIf you want to know why\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nwe unerringly seem to get China wrong --\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nour predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nthis is the reason.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nUnfortunately, I think,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nI have to say that I think\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nattitude towards China\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nis that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt's kind of arrogant.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nIt's arrogant in the sense\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthat we think that we are best,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand therefore we have the universal measure.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd secondly, it's ignorant.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nWe refuse to really address\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthe issue of difference.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nYou know, there's a very interesting passage\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nin a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd Paul Cohen argues\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nthat the West thinks of itself\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nas probably the most cosmopolitan\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nof all cultures.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nBut it's not.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nIn many ways,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nit's the most parochial,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause for 200 years,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthe West has been so dominant in the world\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nthat it's not really needed\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nto understand other cultures,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nother civilizations.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBecause, at the end of the day,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nit could, if necessary by force,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nget its own way.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nWhereas those cultures --\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nvirtually the rest of the world, in fact,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwhich have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nhave been thereby forced to understand the West,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nbecause of the West's presence in those societies.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nAnd therefore, they are, as a result,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nmore cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI mean, take the question of East Asia.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nEast Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\na third of the world's population lives there.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nNow the largest economic region in the world.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd I'll tell you now,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nthat East Asianers, people from East Asia,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nare far more knowledgeable\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nabout the West\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthan the West is about East Asia.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nNow this point is very germane, I'm afraid,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nto the present.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nBecause what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nthe Goldman Sachs chart.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWhat is happening\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nis that, very rapidly in historical terms,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nthe world is being driven\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand shaped,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nnot by the old developed countries,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nbut by the developing world.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nWe've seen this\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nin terms of the G20\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nusurping very rapidly the position of the G7,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nor the G8.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAnd there are two consequences of this.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nFirst, the West\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nis rapidly losing\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nits influence in the world.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThere was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago --\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nCopenhagen, climate change conference.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nEurope was not at the final negotiating table.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nWhen did that last happen?\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nI would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nAnd that is what is going to happen in the future.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nAnd the second implication\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nis that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nbecome increasingly unfamiliar to us,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nbecause it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nthat we are not really familiar with,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nor conversant with.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nAnd at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe;\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nAmerica is slightly different --\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nbut Europeans by and large, I have to say,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nare ignorant,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nare unaware\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nabout the way the world is changing.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nSome people -- I've got an English friend in China,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nand he said, \"The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.\"\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nWell, maybe that's true,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nmaybe that's an exaggeration.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nBut there's another problem which goes along with this --\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nthat Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world --\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nand that is a sort of\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nloss of a sense of the future.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nI mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nin its confidence.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nTake the 19th century, for example.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nBut this, alas, is no longer true.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nIf you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\ntry China -- there's old Confucius.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nThis is a railway station\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nthe likes of which you've never seen before.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nIt doesn't even look like a railway station.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nThis is the new [Wuhan] railway station\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nfor the high-speed trains.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nChina already has a bigger network\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nthan any other country in the world\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nOr take this: now this is an idea,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nbut it's an idea to be tried out shortly\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nin a suburb of Beijing.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nHere you have a megabus,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\non the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nIt travels on rails\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\ndown a suburban road,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nand the cars travel underneath it.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nAnd it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nNow this is the way things are going to move,\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nbecause China has a very specific problem,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nwhich is different from Europe\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nand different from the United States:\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nChina has huge numbers of people and no space.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo this is a solution to a situation\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nwhere China's going to have\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nmany, many, many cities\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nover 20 million people.\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nOkay, so how would I like to finish?\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nWell, what should our attitude be\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\ntowards this world\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nthat we see\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nvery rapidly developing\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nbefore us?\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nI think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nBut I want to argue, above all,\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\na big-picture positive for this world.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nFor 200 years,\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nthe world was essentially governed\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nby a fragment of the human population.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nThat's what Europe and North America represented.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nThe arrival of countries\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nlike China and India --\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nbetween them 38 percent of the world's population --\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nand others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nrepresent the most important single act\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nof

had no voice,\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nwhich were not listened to, which were not known about,\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nwill have a different sort\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nof representation in this world.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nAs humanists, we must welcome, surely,\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nthis transformation,\n\n00:20:30.958 -->

Because we are all patients, we are all people. Even doctors are patients at some point. So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and, in fact, worldwide. If you want to get at the big part \u2014 I mean from a public health level, where my training is \u2014 you're looking at behavioral issues. You're looking at things where people are actually given information, and they're not following through with it. It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes, obesity, many forms of heart disease, even some forms of cancer \u2014 when you think of smoking. Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. They know what they're supposed to be doing, but they're not doing it.Now behavior change is something that is a long-standing problem in medicine. It goes all the way back to Aristotle. And doctors hate it, right? I mean, they complain about it all the time. We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance. When people don't take their pills, when people don't follow doctors' orders \u2014 these are behavior problems. But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change, there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making \u2014 giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them, but actually leads them to make better decisions, better choices in their lives.One part of medicine, though, has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well, and that's dentistry. Dentistry might seem \u2014 and I think it is \u2014 many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry. But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. People brush and floss their teeth. They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago. So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one, because it was very simple, so it's an easy story to tell. So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often, and they were going to use one variable: they wanted to scare them. They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. They had a big patient population. They divided them up into two groups. They had a low-fear population, where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation, all based in science, but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth, you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth, but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad. So that was the low-fear group. The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick. They showed bloody gums. They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies, and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth. They would get dentures, and if you got dentures, you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob, you weren't going to be able to eat apples, you weren't going to be able to eat steak. You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. So go brush and floss your teeth. That was the message. That was the experiment.Now they measured one other variable. They wanted to capture one other variable, which was the patients' sense of efficacy. This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. So they asked them at the beginning, \"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?\" And the people who said, \"Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,\" they were characterized as high efficacy, and the people who said, \"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,\" they were characterized as low efficacy. So the upshot was this. The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen \u2014 it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. So fear showed up as not really the driver. It was the sense of efficacy.So I want to isolate this, because it was a great observation \u2014 30 years ago, right, 30 years ago \u2014 and it's one that's laid fallow in research. It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work, who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one \u2014 that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. In health care terms, you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health, that they can actually see their way towards getting better health, and that's a very important notion. It's an amazing notion. We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well. Except, maybe we do.So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work. And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, \"Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?\" And I had to explain, \"They're trying to scare people.\" And I don't know if it works.Now here's what does work: personalized information works. Again, Bandura recognized this years ago, decades ago. When you give people specific information about their health, where they stand, and where they want to get to, where they might get to, that path, that notion of a path \u2014 that tends to work for behavior change. So let me just spool it out a little bit. So you start with personalized data, personalized information that comes from an individual, and then you need to connect it to their lives. You need to connect it to their lives, hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand. Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers \u2014 this overload of health information that we're inundated with. But it actually hits home. It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts. There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. That information then needs to be connected to choices, needs to be connected to a range of options, directions that we might go to \u2014 trade-offs, benefits. Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action. We need to connect the information always with the action, and then that action feeds back into different information, and it creates, of course, a feedback loop.Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. But the problem is that things \u2014 in the upper-right corner there \u2014 personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by. It's a difficult and expensive commodity, until now. So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works. So we've all seen these. These are the \"your speed limit\" signs. You've seen them all around, especially these days as radars are cheaper. And here's how they work in the feedback loop. So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25, and, of course, you're going faster than that. We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. The choice in this case is pretty simple. We either keep going fast, or we slow down. We should probably slow down, and that point of action is probably now. We should take our foot off the pedal right now, and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent. They last for about five miles, in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. But it works, and it even has some health repercussions. Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.But by and large, this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. Because in health care, most health care, the data is very removed from the action. It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. But we have an opportunity. So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country, how we actually get information. This is a pharmaceutical ad. Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. But it looks completely right. So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect. And then we turn the page of the magazine, and we see this \u2014 now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads, or to follow their ads, and to me, this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine. Because we know. Who among us would actually say that people read this? And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it? This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. There is no good faith in this.So this is a different approach. This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. And they created this thing called the \"drug facts box.\" They took inspiration from, of all things, Cap'n Crunch. They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food, actually helps people understand what's in their food. God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. So let me just walk through this quickly. It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for, so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. You can understand exactly what the benefits are. It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is. And finally, you understand what those choices are. You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect. So it spells those out in very clean terms, and that works.So I love this. I love that drug facts box. And so I was thinking about, what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information? What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use? And so I came up with this: lab test results. Blood test results are this great source of information. They're packed with information. They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. They go right to doctors. And God forbid \u2014 I think many doctors, if you really asked them, they don't really understand all this stuff either. This is the worst presented information. You ask Tufte, and he would say, \"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible.\"What we did at Wired was we went, and I got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports. So that's what I want to walk you through. So this is the general blood work before, and this is the after, this is what we came up with. The after takes what was four pages \u2014 that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know. This is our one-page summary. We use the notion of color. It's an amazing notion that color could be used. So on the top-level you have your overall results, the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context, and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level.Likewise, you can go over your lipids and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. But again, always using color and personalized proximity to that information. All those other values, all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing, we summarize. We tell you that you're okay, you're normal. But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop: we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. And then we go a further step \u2014 we tell them what they can do. We give them some insight into what choices they can make, what actions they can take. So that's our general blood work test.Then we went to CRP test. In this case, it's a sin of omission. They have this huge amount of space, and they don't use it for anything, so we do. Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test, or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page, which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed, which might be a risk for heart disease. What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is.The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. Here's the before, and here's the after. Now a lot of our effort on this one \u2014 as many of you probably know, a PSA test is a very controversial test. It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. We again personalized the risks. So this patient is in their 50s, so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that. And then again, the follow-up actions.So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right. That's what Wired magazine spent on this. Why is Wired magazine doing this? (Laughter) Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two largest lab testing companies \u2014 last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively. Now this is not a problem of resources; this is a problem of incentives. We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company. It should be the patient. It's the person who actually, in the end, is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors.This is information that is incredibly powerful. It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. It's being lost. So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. But you can create your own feedback loop. Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions: Can I have my results? And the only acceptable answer is \u2014 (Audience: Yes.) \u2014 yes. What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is. What are my options? What choices are now on the table? And then, what's next? How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life?So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information, if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. And this information is out there.I've been talking today about latent information, all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online, and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people, to help people and to change the course of their lives.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1060, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm going to be talking to you\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nabout how we can tap\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\na really underutilized resource in health care,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nwhich is the patient,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nor, as I like to use the scientific term,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\npeople.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nBecause we are all patients, we are all people.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nEven doctors are patients at some point.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nSo I want to talk about that\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nas an opportunity\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nthat we really have failed to engage with very well in this country\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand, in fact, worldwide.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nIf you want to get at the big part --\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI mean from a public health level, where my training is --\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nyou're looking at behavioral issues.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nYou're looking at things where people are actually given information,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand they're not following through with it.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nIt's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nobesity, many forms of heart disease,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\neven some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThose are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nThey know what they're supposed to be doing,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nbut they're not doing it.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nNow behavior change is something\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthat is a long-standing problem in medicine.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nIt goes all the way back to Aristotle.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd doctors hate it, right?\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nI mean, they complain about it all the time.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nWe talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nWhen people don't take their pills,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwhen people don't follow doctors' orders --\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthese are behavior problems.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nBut for as much as clinical medicine\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nagonizes over behavior change,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nthere's not a lot of work done\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nin terms of trying to fix that problem.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo the crux of it\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\ncomes down to this notion of decision-making --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\ngiving information to people in a form\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthat doesn't just educate them\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nor inform them,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nbut actually leads them to make better decisions,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nbetter choices in their lives.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nOne part of medicine, though,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhas faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nand that's dentistry.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nDentistry might seem -- and I think it is --\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nmany dentists would have to acknowledge\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nit's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nNot a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nBut they have really taken this problem of behavior change\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nand solved it.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nIt's the one great preventive health success\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nwe have in our health care system.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nPeople brush and floss their teeth.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nThey don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nSo I'm going to talk about one experiment\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthat a few dentists in Connecticut\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\ncooked up about 30 years ago.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nSo this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nbecause it was very simple,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nso it's an easy story to tell.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo these Connecticut dentists decided\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand they were going to use one variable:\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthey wanted to scare them.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThey wanted to tell them how bad it would be\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nif they didn't brush and floss their teeth.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nThey had a big patient population.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nThey divided them up into two groups.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThey had a low-fear population,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwhere they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nall based in science,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nyou could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nbut you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo that was the low-fear group.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThe high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nThey showed bloody gums.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThey showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThey told them that their teeth were going to fall out.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThey said that they could have infections\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nThey would get dentures, and if you got dentures,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nyou weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nyou weren't going to be able to eat apples,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nyou weren't going to be able to eat steak.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nYou'll eat mush for the rest of your life.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSo go brush and floss your teeth.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThat was the message. That was the experiment.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nNow they measured one other variable.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThey wanted to capture one other variable,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwhich was the patients' sense of efficacy.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThis was the notion of whether the patients felt\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthat they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo they asked them at the beginning,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\n\"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd the people who said, \"Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthey were characterized as high efficacy,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand the people who said,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\n\"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,\"\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthey were characterized as low efficacy.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo the upshot was this.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThe upshot of this experiment\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwas that fear was not really a primary driver\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nof the behavior at all.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThe people who brushed and flossed their teeth\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwere not necessarily the people\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwho were really scared about what would happen --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nit's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto change their behavior.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nSo fear showed up as not really the driver.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIt was the sense of efficacy.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nSo I want to isolate this,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nbecause it was a great observation --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand it's one that's laid fallow in research.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt was a notion that really came out\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nof Albert Bandura's work,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nwho studied whether\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\npeople could get a sense of empowerment.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThe notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nif somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nIn health care terms, you could characterize this\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nas whether or not somebody feels\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nthat they see a path towards better health,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat they can actually see their way towards getting better health,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand that's a very important notion.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nIt's an amazing notion.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nWe don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nExcept, maybe we do.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd this is a great example\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nof how we haven't learned that lesson at all.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThis is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThis is still the way we're communicating messages about health.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nI mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand he's like, \"Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?\"\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd I had to explain, \"They're trying to scare people.\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I don't know if it works.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nNow here's what does work:\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\npersonalized information works.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAgain, Bandura recognized this\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nyears ago, decades ago.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nWhen you give people specific information\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nabout their health, where they stand,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand where they want to get to, where they might get to,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthat path, that notion of a path --\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthat tends to work for behavior change.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSo let me just spool it out a little bit.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nSo you start with personalized data, personalized information\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthat comes from an individual,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand then you need to connect it to their lives.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nYou need to connect it to their lives,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nhopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nOkay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthis overload of health information\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat we're inundated with.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBut it actually hits home.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThere's an emotional connection to information\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbecause it's from us.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThat information then needs to be connected to choices,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nneeds to be connected to a range of options,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\ndirections that we might go to --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\ntrade-offs, benefits.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nFinally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nWe need to connect the information\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nalways with the action,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand then that action feeds back\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\ninto different information,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand it creates, of course, a feedback loop.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nNow this is a very well-observed and well-established notion\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nfor behavior change.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nBut the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\npersonalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nIt's a difficult and expensive commodity,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nuntil now.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSo I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo we've all seen these. These are the \"your speed limit\" signs.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nYou've seen them all around,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nespecially these days as radars are cheaper.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd here's how they work in the feedback loop.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo you start with the personalized data\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhere the speed limit on the road that you are at that point\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nis 25,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand, of course, you're going faster than that.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nWe always are. We're always going above the speed limit.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nThe choice in this case is pretty simple.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nWe either keep going fast, or we slow down.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWe should probably slow down,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand that point of action is probably now.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nWe should take our foot off the pedal right now,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nin terms of getting people to slow down.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThey reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThey last for about five miles,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nin which case we put our foot back on the pedal.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nBut it works, and it even has some health repercussions.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nYour blood pressure might drop a little bit.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nMaybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nBut by and large, this is a feedback loop\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat's so nifty and too rare.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nBecause in health care, most health care,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nthe data is very removed from the action.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nIt's very difficult to line things up so neatly.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut we have an opportunity.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nSo I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nhow we deliver health information in this country,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nhow we actually get information.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThis is a pharmaceutical ad.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nActually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nNobody's had the brilliant idea\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nof calling their drug Havidol quite yet.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut it looks completely right.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nSo it's exactly the way we get\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nhealth information and pharmaceutical information,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand it just sounds perfect.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd then we turn the page of the magazine,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand we see this --\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nnow this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nto put into their ads, or to follow their ads,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand to me, this is one of the most \ncynical exercises in medicine.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nBecause we know.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nWho among us would actually say that people read this?\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd who among us would actually say\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthat people who do try to read this\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nactually get anything out of it?\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThis is a bankrupt effort\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nat communicating health information.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThere is no good faith in this.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo this is a different approach.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThis is an approach that has been developed\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nby a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nLisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd they created this thing called the \"drug facts box.\"\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThey took inspiration from, of all things,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nCap'n Crunch.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThey went to the nutritional information box\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nactually helps people understand what's in their food.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nGod forbid we should use that same standard\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthat we make Cap'n Crunch live by\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand bring it to drug companies.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo let me just walk through this quickly.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIt says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nso you can start to personalize your understanding\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nof whether the information is relevant to you\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nor whether the drug is relevant to you.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nYou can understand exactly what the benefits are.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nIt isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbut you get the statistics for how effective it is.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nAnd finally, you understand what those choices are.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nYou can start to unpack the choices involved\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nbecause of the side effects.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nEvery time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nSo it spells those out in very clean terms,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand that works.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo I love this. I love that drug facts box.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd so I was thinking about,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhat's an opportunity that I could have\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nto help people understand information?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nWhat's another latent body of information that's out there\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat people are really not putting to use?\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd so I came up with this: lab test results.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nBlood test results are this great source of information.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nThey're packed with information.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThey're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThey go right to doctors.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthey don't really understand all this stuff either.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nThis is the worst presented information.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nYou ask Tufte, and he would say,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\n\"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible.\"\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nWhat we did at Wired\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwas we went, and I got our graphic design department\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nto re-imagine these lab reports.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSo that's what I want to walk you through.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nSo this is the general blood work before,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand this is the after, this is what we came up with.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe after takes what was four pages --\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthat previous slide was actually\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nthe first of four pages of data\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat's just the general blood work.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nIt goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThis is our one-page summary.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nWe use the notion of color.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt's an amazing notion that color could be used.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nSo on the top-level you have your overall results,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthe things that might jump out at you from the fine print.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThen you can drill down\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand understand how actually we put your level in context,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand we use color to illustrate\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nexactly where your value falls.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nIn this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nbecause of their glucose level.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nLikewise, you can go over your lipids\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nBut again, always using color\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand personalized proximity\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nto that information.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAll those other values,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nall those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nwe summarize.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nWe tell you that you're okay, you're normal.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nBut you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd then we do two other very important things\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nthat kind of help fill in this feedback loop:\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwe help people understand in a little more detail\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nwhat these values are and what they might indicate.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWe give them some insight\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\ninto what choices they can make, what actions they can take.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nSo that's our general blood work test.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThen we went to CRP test.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nIn this case, it's a sin of omission.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThey have this huge amount of space,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nand they don't use it for anything, so we do.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nNow the CRP test is often done\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nfollowing a cholesterol test,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nor in conjunction with a cholesterol test.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nSo we take the bold step\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nof putting the cholesterol information on the same page,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nwhich is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nIt's a protein that shows up\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhen your blood vessels might be inflamed,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwhich might be a risk for heart disease.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWhat you're actually measuring\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nis spelled out in clean language.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThen we use the information\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthat's already in the lab report.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nWe use the person's age and their gender\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nto start to fill in the personalized risks.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nSo we start to use the data we have\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nto run a very simple calculation\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nthat's on all sorts of online calculators\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nto get a sense of what the actual risk is.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThe last one I'll show you is a PSA test.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nHere's the before, and here's the after.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nNow a lot of our effort on this one --\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nas many of you probably know,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\na PSA test is a very controversial test.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nIt's used to test for prostate cancer,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nbut there are all sorts of reasons\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwhy your prostate might be enlarged.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd so we spent a good deal of our

50s,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nso we can actually give them a very precise estimate\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nof what their risk for prostate cancer is.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nIn this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAnd then again, the follow-up actions.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nSo our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThat's what Wired magazine spent on this.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nWhy is Wired magazine doing this?\n\n00:14:15.958 -->

00:14:40.958\nshould not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nIt should be the patient.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nIt's the person who actually, in the end,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nis going to be having to change their lives\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand then start adopting new behaviors.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThis is information that is incredibly powerful.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nIt's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBut we're not using it. It's just sitting there.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nIt's being lost.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nSo I want to just offer four questions\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat every patient should ask,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause I don't actually expect people\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nto start developing these lab test reports.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nBut you can create your own feedback loop.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nAnybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nCan I have my results?\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd the only acceptable answer is --\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\n(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nWhat does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nWhat are my options? What choices are now on the table?\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd then, what's next?\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nHow do I integrate this information\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\ninto the longer course of my life?\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo I want to wind up by just showing\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthat people have the capacity to understand this information.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nThis is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nYou do not need to have the education level of people in this room.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nOrdinary people are capable of understanding this information,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nif we only go to the effort of presenting it to them\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nin a form that they can engage with.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd engagement is essential here,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nbecause it's not just giving them information;\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nit's giving them an opportunity to act.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nThat's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nIt works totally different from the way we talk about behavior\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nin medicine today.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nAnd this information is out there.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nI've been talking today about latent information,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nall this information that exists in the system\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthat we're not putting to use.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nBut there are all sorts of other bodies of information\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nthat are coming online,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nand we need to recognize the capacity of this information\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nto engage people, to help people\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nand to change the course of their lives.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Drawing on humor for change", "duration": "402", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/liza_donnelly_drawing_upon_humor_for_change", "transcript": "(Laughter)I was afraid of womanhood. Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend. I've learned to be flexible. In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear. Let me explain. Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy \u2014 really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.(Laughter)There were plenty of role models all around us. We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words, telling us how to be. Now my mother was different. She was a homemaker, but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together, and she didn't buy me pink outfits. Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons. And I just ate it up. I drew, and I drew, and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family, I could draw, do what I wanted to do, and not have to perform, not have to speak \u2014 I was very shy \u2014 and I could still get approval. I was launched as a cartoonist. Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know \u2014 we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is. We're told what shape we're supposed to be in. (Laughter) We're told what to wear \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and how to do our hair \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and how to behave.Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture. We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition. We pass it down from generation to generation. Not only that \u2014 we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us. And on top of all off these rules, they keep changing. (Laughter) We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous position.(Laughter)Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't \u2014 I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them \u2014 what better way than to change them [than] with humor? Humor relies on the traditions of a society. It takes what we know, and it twists it. It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh. Now what if you put together women and humor? I think you can get change. Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table.Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos. I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on. And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 try to bring my family together with laughter. It didn't work. My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested. But I found my place. I found that I didn't have to wear high heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in.Now when I was a little older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning. And I thought, \"Well, maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning,\" and so I did. I became a cartoonist. And then I thought \u2014 in my 40s I started thinking, \"Well, why don't I do something? I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?\"Now my perspective is a particularly \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 my perspective is a particularly American perspective. I can't help it. I live here. Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman. But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal, of course \u2014 that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions, and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S. Consequently, we have. Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition. We have amazing antennae.Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart. My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world \u2014 countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France \u2014 and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances. But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions, because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers, that we can have the great potential to be change-agents.

Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras. But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first, because it's still sage advice, even today. \"Know thyself.\" It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless, but it rings familiar and true, doesn't it? \"Know thyself.\" I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems, or more exactly, the confusions, of consciousness. I've always been fascinated with knowing the self. This fascination led me to submerge myself in art, study neuroscience, and later, to become a psychotherapist.Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon, a thought-controlled computing company. My goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves. I take it from this little dictum, \"Know thyself.\" If you think about it, this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species, isn't it? I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind.Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves. Under the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations, e-mails, relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags, we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place: Ourselves. Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world. And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves. We've cluttered ourselves up with all this. And we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat, leaving it all behind.So we go far away to the top of a mountain, assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday, and find ourselves again. But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind, what are we really achieving? It's really only a successful escape. Think of the term we use, \"Retreat.\" This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle. It means we've got to get out of here. Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world, that in order to get inside ourselves, you have to run for the hills? And the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home, eventually. So when you think about it, we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. And eventually, that vacation's got to come to an end.So my question to you is, can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape? Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek? Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions, \"Know thyself?\" I say the answer is yes. And I'm here today to share a new way that we're working with technology to this end, to get familiar with our inner self like never before \u2014 humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours to more fully know the self. It's called thought-controlled computing.You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead. This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk. These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph. Let me show you what it looks like. That blue line there is my brainwave. It's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time. The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency, with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here. You're actually looking inside my head as I speak. These graphs are compelling, they're undulating, but from a human's perspective, they're actually not very useful. That's why we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it.For instance, what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment? Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen? The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head. The more relaxed I am, the more the energy's going to fall through it. I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am, so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side. And the more focused my brain is, the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.Ordinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way. As we know, our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable. We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it, and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier. This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves. We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient, our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever. I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit, but first I want to take a look at how we got here. By the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time.(Laughter)My team at InteraXon and I have been developing thought-controlled application for almost a decade now. In the first phase of development, we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind. We were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking. We were transcending the space between the mind and the device. We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind, like thought-controlled home appliances or slot-car games or video games or a levitating chair. We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations, and it was really exciting.And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics. We were invited to create a massive installation at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics, were used in Vancouver, got to control the lighting on the CN Tower, the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls from all the way across the country using their minds. Over 17 days at the Olympics, 7,000 visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the CN Tower, parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country, 3,000 km away. So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool.But we're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction. And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. And that was responsiveness. We realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you. And it could join into the relationship with you. We created the responsive room where the lights, music and blinds adjusted to your state. They followed these little shifts in your mental activity. So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day, on the couch in our office, the music would mellow with you. When you read, the desk lamp would get brighter. If you nod off, the system would know, dimming to darkness as you do.We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you, there's an even more valuable application than that. That you could know something about yourself. We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden. Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here.Here's an application that I created for the iPad. So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form. So you use it with your headset. The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone. In that headset, you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear. In the original Zen Bound game, you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad. In the game that we created, of course, you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind. As you focus on the wooden form, it rotates. The more you focus, the faster the rotation. This is for real. This is not a fake. What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game, you get stats and feedback about how you did. You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing \u2014 not just how much rope you used or what your high score is, but what was going on inside of your mind. And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.I like to call this \"intra-active.\" Normally, we think about technology as interactive. This technology is intra-active. It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward. So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop. At InteraXon \u2014 intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates. It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop.For example, thought-controlled computing can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus. With ADD, children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states. So you can create applications that reward focused brain states. So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it. This can be as effective as Ritalin. Perhaps even more importantly, thought-controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states, so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs. The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with.We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us, what once mystified and separated us. Brainwave technology can understand us, anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs. Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan. Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight. It would be like plugging into your own personal Google.On the subject of Google, today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them. You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them. Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this. Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it. As it aligns with our human behaviors, it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and, more importantly, why. Creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are.With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles. When our productivity starts to slacken, we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play. Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self, what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk? Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest, or what activities brought you joy. Would you make more time for those people? Would you prioritize? Would you get a divorce?(Laughter)What thought-controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives. And with this, we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time. We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on. And from this, we can learn how to change the plot, the outcome and the character of our personal stories.Two millennia ago, those Greeks had some powerful insights. They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase, when you come into contact with yourself. They understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing, evolving and growing. But they understood something more fundamental \u2014 the sheer joy in discovery, the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it; the richness that we get from seeing, feeling and knowing the lives that we are.My mom's an artist, and as a child, I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush. One moment, it was all white space, pure possibility. The next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions. As I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas, I learned that you could create your own world. I learned that our own inner worlds \u2014 our ideas, emotions and imaginations \u2014 were, in fact, not bound by our brains and bodies. If you could think it, if you could discover it, you could bring it to life.To me, thought-controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush \u2014 one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us. I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side, watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1338, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.937\nThe maxim, \"Know thyself\"\nhas been around since the ancient Greeks.\n\n00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:21.162\nSome attribute this golden world\nknowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.\n\n00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:24.362\nBut the truth is it doesn't really matter\nwhich sage said it first,\n\n00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:27.173\nbecause it's still\nsage advice, even today.\n\n00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.189\n\"Know thyself.\"\n\n00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:34.143\nIt's pithy almost to the point\nof being meaningless,\n\n00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.702\nbut it rings familiar\nand true, doesn't it?\n\n00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:39.163\n\"Know thyself.\"\n\n00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.107\nI understand this timeless dictum\nas a statement about the problems,\n\n00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.933\nor more exactly, the confusions,\nof consciousness.\n\n00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:49.770\nI've always been fascinated\nwith knowing the self.\n\n00:00:49.794 --> 00:00:52.301\nThis fascination led me\nto submerge myself in art,\n\n00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.782\nstudy neuroscience,\nand later, to become a psychotherapist.\n\n00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:59.482\nToday I combine all my passions\nas the CEO of InteraXon,\n\n00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.551\na thought-controlled computing company.\n\n00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:06.933\nMy goal, quite simply, is to help people\nbecome more in tune with themselves.\n\n00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:10.360\nI take it from this\nlittle dictum, \"Know thyself.\"\n\n00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:12.565\nIf you think about it,\n\n00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:17.133\nthis imperative is kind of the defining\ncharacteristic of our species, isn't it?\n\n00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.458\nI mean, it's self-awareness\n\n00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:23.098\nthat separates Homo sapiens\nfrom earlier instances of our mankind.\n\n00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:26.686\nToday we're often too busy\n\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.491\ntending to our iPhones and iPods\nto really stop and get to know ourselves.\n\n00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.522\nUnder the deluge of minute-to-minute\ntext conversations,\n\n00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:37.606\ne-mails, relentless exchange\nof media channels\n\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.431\nand passwords and apps\nand reminders and Tweets and tags,\n\n00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:44.181\nwe lose sight of what all this fuss is\nsupposed to be about in the first place:\n\n00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:45.820\nOurselves.\n\n00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.896\nMuch of the time we're transfixed\n\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.212\nby all of the ways we can reflect\nourselves out into the world.\n\n00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:56.417\nAnd we can barely find the time to reflect\ndeeply back in on our own selves.\n\n00:01:57.514 --> 00:02:00.073\nWe've cluttered ourselves up\nwith all this.\n\n00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:03.528\nAnd we feel like we have to get\nfar, far away to a secluded retreat,\n\n00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:05.002\nleaving it all behind.\n\n00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:08.134\nSo we go far away\nto the top of a mountain,\n\n00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:10.188\nassuming that perching\nourselves on a piece\n\n00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:14.701\nis bound to give us the respite we need\nto sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,\n\n00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:16.399\nand find ourselves again.\n\n00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:21.581\nBut on that mountain where we gain\nthat beautiful peace of mind,\n\n00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:23.662\nwhat are we really achieving?\n\n00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:27.370\nIt's really only a successful escape.\n\n00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:30.246\nThink of the term we use, \"Retreat.\"\n\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.091\nThis is the term that armies use\nwhen they've lost a battle.\n\n00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:34.944\nIt means we've got to get out of here.\n\n00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:37.463\nIs this how we feel\nabout the pressures of our world,\n\n00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:39.481\nthat in order to get inside ourselves,\n\n00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:40.934\nyou have to run for the hills?\n\n00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:44.789\nAnd the problem with escaping\nyour day-to-day life\n\n00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:47.228\nis that you have to come home, eventually.\n\n00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:49.862\nSo when you think about it,\n\n00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:54.340\nwe're almost like a tourist\nvisiting ourselves over there.\n\n00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.933\nAnd eventually, that vacation's got\nto come to an end.\n\n00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:00.282\nSo my question to you is,\n\n00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:04.385\ncan we find ways to know ourselves\nwithout the escape?\n\n00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.700\nCan we redefine our relationship\nwith the technologized world\n\n00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:12.372\nin order to have the heightened\nsense of self-awareness that we seek?\n\n00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:15.872\nCan we live here and now in our wired web\n\n00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:20.418\nand still follow those ancient\ninstructions, \"Know thyself?\"\n\n00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:23.624\nI say the answer is yes.\n\n00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.694\nAnd I'm here today to share a new way\n\n00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:28.128\nthat we're working\nwith technology to this end,\n\n00:03:28.152 --> 00:03:31.607\nto get familiar with our inner self\nlike never before --\n\n00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:36.124\nhumanizing technology\nand furthering that age-old quest of ours\n\n00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:37.686\nto more fully know the self.\n\n00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:41.958\nIt's called thought-controlled computing.\n\n00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.306\nYou may or may not have noticed\n\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.639\nthat I'm wearing a tiny\nelectrode on my forehead.\n\n00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:50.334\nThis is actually a brainwave sensor\n\n00:03:50.358 --> 00:03:52.714\nthat's reading the electrical\nactivity of my brain\n\n00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:53.934\nas I give this talk.\n\n00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.939\nThese brainwaves are being analyzed\nand we can see them as a graph.\n\n00:03:57.963 --> 00:03:59.934\nLet me show you what it looks like.\n\n00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:03.436\nThat blue line there is my brainwave.\n\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.595\nIt's the direct signal being recorded\nfrom my head, rendered in real time.\n\n00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:11.030\nThe green and red bars show\nthat same signal displayed by frequency,\n\n00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:12.768\nwith lower frequencies here\n\n00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:14.495\nand higher frequencies up here.\n\n00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:18.107\nYou're actually looking\ninside my head as I speak.\n\n00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:22.663\nThese graphs are compelling,\nthey're undulating,\n\n00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:25.933\nbut from a human's perspective,\nthey're actually not very useful.\n\n00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.744\nThat's why we've spent a lot of time\n\n00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:32.545\nthinking about how to make this data\nmeaningful to the people who use it.\n\n00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.083\nFor instance,\n\n00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:38.062\nwhat if I could use this data to find out\nhow relaxed I am at any moment?\n\n00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.907\nOr what if I can take that information\n\n00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:42.913\nand put it into an organic\nshape up on the screen?\n\n00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:45.471\nThe shape on the right over here\n\n00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:48.172\nhas become an indicator\nof what's going on in my head.\n\n00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:49.690\nThe more relaxed I am,\n\n00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:52.176\nthe more the energy's going\nto fall through it.\n\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.054\nI may also be interested in knowing\nhow focused I am,\n\n00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:58.836\nso I can put my level of attention\ninto the circuit board on the other side.\n\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.475\nAnd the more focused my brain is,\n\n00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.380\nthe more the circuit board\nis going to surge with energy.\n\n00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:06.828\nOrdinarily, I would have no way\nof knowing how focused or relaxed I was\n\n00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:08.591\nin any tangible way.\n\n00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:11.813\nAs we know, our feelings\nabout how we're feeling\n\n00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:13.666\nare notoriously unreliable.\n\n00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.523\nWe've all had stress creep up\non us without even noticing it\n\n00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:18.963\nuntil we lost it on someone\nwho didn't deserve it,\n\n00:05:18.987 --> 00:05:22.561\nand then we realize that we probably\nshould have checked in with ourselves\n\n00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:23.738\na little earlier.\n\n00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:26.880\nThis new awareness\nopens up vast possibilities\n\n00:05:26.904 --> 00:05:29.934\nfor applications that help\nimprove our lives and ourselves.\n\n00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:33.842\nWe're trying to create technology\nthat uses the insights\n\n00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:36.549\nto make our work more efficient,\nour breaks more relaxing\n\n00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:39.573\nand our connections deeper\nand more fulfilling than ever.\n\n00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:43.322\nI'm going to share some of these\nvisions with you in a bit,\n\n00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:45.934\nbut first I want to take\na look at how we got here.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.934\nBy the way, feel free to check\nin on my head at any time.\n\n00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:51.403\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:52.934\nMy team at InteraXon and I\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.747\nhave been developing thought-controlled\napplication for almost a decade now.\n\n00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.391\nIn the first phase of development,\n\n00:05:58.415 --> 00:06:01.851\nwe were really enthused by all the things\nwe could control with our mind.\n\n00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:06.149\nWe were making things activate,\nlight up and work just by thinking.\n\n00:06:06.697 --> 00:06:10.313\nWe were transcending the space\nbetween the mind and the device.\n\n00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:13.707\nWe brought to life a vast array\nof prototypes and products\n\n00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:15.752\nthat you could control with your mind,\n\n00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.692\nlike thought-controlled home appliances\n\n00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:21.432\nor slot-car games or video games\nor a levitating chair.\n\n00:06:22.202 --> 00:06:25.831\nWe created technology and applications\nthat engaged people's imaginations,\n\n00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:27.316\nand it was really exciting.\n\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.172\nAnd then we were asked to do something\nreally big for the Olympics.\n\n00:06:31.797 --> 00:06:34.060\nWe were invited to create\na massive installation\n\n00:06:34.084 --> 00:06:35.922\nat the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,\n\n00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:37.477\nwere used in Vancouver,\n\n00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.218\ngot to control the lighting\non the CN Tower,\n\n00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:43.157\nthe Canadian Parliament\nbuildings and Niagara Falls\n\n00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:46.933\nfrom all the way across the country\nusing their minds.\n\n00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:50.481\nOver 17 days at the Olympics,\n7,000 visitors from all over the world\n\n00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:52.670\nactually got to individually\ncontrol the light\n\n00:06:52.694 --> 00:06:55.325\nfrom the CN Tower, parliament\nand Niagara in real time\n\n00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.370\nwith their minds from across\nthe country, 3,000 km away.\n\n00:06:58.394 --> 00:07:01.933\nSo controlling stuff\nwith your mind is pretty cool.\n\n00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:06.230\nBut we're always interested in multitiered\nlevels of human interaction.\n\n00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:09.655\nAnd so we began looking into inventing\nthought-controlled applications\n\n00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.950\nin a more complex frame than just control.\n\n00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.934\nAnd that was responsiveness.\n\n00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.270\nWe realized that we had a system\n\n00:07:17.294 --> 00:07:19.900\nthat allowed technology\nto know something about you.\n\n00:07:19.924 --> 00:07:22.559\nAnd it could join\ninto the relationship with you.\n\n00:07:23.283 --> 00:07:25.407\nWe created the responsive room\n\n00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:28.423\nwhere the lights, music and blinds\nadjusted to your state.\n\n00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:31.801\nThey followed these little shifts\nin your mental activity.\n\n00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:34.619\nSo as you settled into relaxation\nat the end of a hard day,\n\n00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:35.974\non the couch in our office,\n\n00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:38.154\nthe music would mellow with you.\n\n00:07:38.178 --> 00:07:40.784\nWhen you read, the desk lamp\nwould get brighter.\n\n00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:45.323\nIf you nod off, the system would know,\ndimming to darkness as you do.\n\n00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:50.258\nWe then realized that if technology\ncould know something about you\n\n00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:51.488\nand use it to help you,\n\n00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.332\nthere's an even more valuable\napplication than that.\n\n00:07:54.356 --> 00:07:57.427\nThat you could know\nsomething about yourself.\n\n00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:01.360\nWe could know sides of ourselves\nthat were all but invisible\n\n00:08:01.384 --> 00:08:03.933\nand come to see things\nthat were previously hidden.\n\n00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:07.537\nLet me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about here.\n\n00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.104\nHere's an application\nthat I created for the iPad.\n\n00:08:10.128 --> 00:08:15.367\nSo the goal of the original game Zen Bound\nis to wrap a rope around a wooden form.\n\n00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.935\nSo you use it with your headset.\n\n00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:19.815\nThe headset connects wirelessly\nto an iPad or a smartphone.\n\n00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:24.486\nIn that headset, you have fabric sensors\non your forehead and above the ear.\n\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.032\nIn the original Zen Bound game,\n\n00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:28.934\nyou play it by scrolling\nyour fingers over the pad.\n\n00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.384\nIn the game that we created, of course,\n\n00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:35.560\nyou control the wooden form\nthat's on the screen there with your mind.\n\n00:08:35.964 --> 00:08:38.183\nAs you focus on the wooden form,\n\n00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:39.402\nit rotates.\n\n00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:42.459\nThe more you focus,\nthe faster the rotation.\n\n00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:44.466\nThis is for real.\n\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.934\nThis is not a fake.\n\n00:08:46.556 --> 00:08:48.396\nWhat's really interesting to me though\n\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.290\nis at the end of the game, you get stats\nand feedback about how you did.\n\n00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:56.403\nYou have graphs and charts\nthat tell you how your brain was doing --\n\n00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:59.479\nnot just how much rope you used\nor what your high score is,\n\n00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:03.351\nbut what was going on inside of your mind.\n\n00:09:03.756 --> 00:09:05.625\nAnd this is valuable feedback\n\n00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:10.168\nthat we can use to understand\nwhat's going on inside of ourselves.\n\n00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:15.186\nI like to call this \"intra-active.\"\n\n00:09:16.048 --> 00:09:19.249\nNormally, we think\nabout technology as interactive.\n\n00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:22.460\nThis technology is intra-active.\n\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.109\nIt understands what's inside of you\n\n00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.498\nand builds a sort\nof responsive relationship\n\n00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:31.519\nbetween you and your technology\n\n00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:35.498\nso that you can use this information\nto move you forward.\n\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.392\nSo you can use this information\nto understand you in a responsive loop.\n\n00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:42.605\nAt InteraXon --\n\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.944\nintra-active technology\nis one of our really defining mandates.\n\n00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:55.526\nIt's how we understand the world inside\nand reflect it outside\n\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.593\ninto this tight loop.\n\n00:09:58.623 --> 00:10:01.752\nFor example, thought-controlled computing\n\n00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:04.933\ncan teach children with ADD\nhow to improve their focus.\n\n00:10:05.384 --> 00:10:09.699\nWith ADD, children have a low proportion\nof beta waves for focus states\n\n00:10:09.723 --> 00:10:11.756\nand a high proportion of theta states.\n\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.966\nSo you can create applications\nthat reward focused brain states.\n\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.195\nSo you can imagine kids playing\nvideo games with their brain waves\n\n00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:20.688\nand improving their ADD\nsymptoms as they do it.\n\n00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:22.606\nThis can be as effective as Ritalin.\n\n00:10:23.543 --> 00:10:25.384\nPerhaps even more importantly,\n\n00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:27.985\nthought-controlled computing\ncan give children with ADD\n\n00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:30.912\ninsights into their own fluctuating\nmental states,\n\n00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:34.568\nso they can better understand themselves\nand their learning needs.\n\n00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:38.568\nThe way these children will be able to use\ntheir new awareness to improve themselves\n\n00:10:38.592 --> 00:10:41.516\nwill upend many of the damaging\nand widespread social stigmas\n\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.380\nthat people who are diagnosed\nas different are challenged with.\n\n00:10:45.872 --> 00:10:47.228\nWe can peer inside our heads\n\n00:10:47.252 --> 00:10:50.035\nand interact with what was once\nlocked away from us,\n\n00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:52.957\nwhat once mystified and separated us.\n\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.590\nBrainwave technology can understand us,\nanticipate our emotions\n\n00:10:57.614 --> 00:10:59.627\nand find the best solutions for our needs.\n\n00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:02.397\nImagine this collected\nawareness of the individual\n\n00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:04.933\ncomputed and reflected\nacross an entire lifespan.\n\n00:11:05.416 --> 00:11:08.933\nImagine the insights that you can gain\nfrom this kind of second sight.\n\n00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:12.384\nIt would be like plugging\ninto your own personal Google.\n\n00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:14.004\nOn the subject of Google,\n\n00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:15.934\ntoday you can search and tag images\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.330\nbased on the thoughts and feelings\nyou had while you watched them.\n\n00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:22.098\nYou can tag pictures\nof baby animals as happy,\n\n00:11:22.122 --> 00:11:24.592\nor whatever baby animals are to you,\n\n00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:28.436\nand then you can search that database,\nnavigating with your feelings,\n\n00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.934\nrather than the keywords\nthat just hint at them.\n\n00:11:31.527 --> 00:11:33.786\nOr you could tag Facebook photos\n\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.402\nwith the emotions that you had\nassociated with those memories\n\n00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:42.128\nand then instantly prioritize\nthe streams that catch your attention,\n\n00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:44.081\njust like this.\n\n00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:48.491\nHumanizing technology\nis about taking what's already natural\n\n00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:50.115\nabout the human-tech experience\n\n00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:53.525\nand building technology\nseamlessly in tandem with it.\n\n00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:55.858\nAs it aligns with our human behaviors,\n\n00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:59.058\nit can allow us to make\nbetter sense of what we do\n\n00:11:59.082 --> 00:12:01.317\nand, more importantly, why.\n\n00:12:01.824 --> 00:12:04.934\nCreating a big picture\nout of all the important little details\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.208\nthat make up who we are.\n\n00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:11.420\nWith humanized technology we can monitor\nthe quality of your sleep cycles.\n\n00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:16.213\nWhen our productivity starts to slacken,\nwe can go back to that data\n\n00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:20.185\nand see how we can make more effective\nbalance between work and play.\n\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.823\nDo you know what causes fatigue in you\nor what brings out your energetic self,\n\n00:12:24.847 --> 00:12:26.765\nwhat triggers cause you to be depressed\n\n00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:30.307\nor what fun things are going\nto bring you out of that funk?\n\n00:12:31.715 --> 00:12:33.361\nImagine if you had access to data\n\n00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:36.582\nthat allowed you to rank\non a scale of overall happiness\n\n00:12:36.606 --> 00:12:39.462\nwhich people in your life\nmade you the happiest,\n\n00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:42.581\nor what activities brought you joy.\n\n00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:45.660\nWould you make more time for those people?\nWould you prioritize?\n\n00:12:45.684 --> 00:12:46.959\nWould you get a divorce?\n\n00:12:46.983 --> 00:12:48.368\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.881\nWhat thought-controlled computing\ncan allow you to do\n\n00:12:50.905 --> 00:12:53.697\nis build colorful layered\npictures of our lives.\n\n00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:57.207\nAnd with this, we can get the skinny\non our psychological happenings\n\n00:12:57.231 --> 00:12:59.639\nand build a story\nof our behaviors over time.\n\n00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:03.296\nWe can begin to see the underlying\nnarratives that propel us forward\n\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.909\nand tell us about what's going on.\n\n00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:11.259\nAnd from this, we can learn\nhow to change the plot, the outcome\n\n00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:14.269\nand the character of our personal stories.\n\n00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:19.665\nTwo millennia ago, those Greeks\nhad some powerful insights.\n\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.800\nThey knew that a fundamental\npiece falls into place\n\n00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:25.563\nwhen you start to live\nout their little phrase,\n\n00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:27.934\nwhen you come into contact with yourself.\n\n00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:31.730\nThey understood the power\nof human narrative\n\n00:13:31.754 --> 00:13:35.750\nand the value that we place on humans\nas changing, evolving and growing.\n\n00:13:36.306 --> 00:13:38.934\nBut they understood something\nmore fundamental --\n\n00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:41.934\nthe sheer joy in discovery,\n\n00:13:43.064 --> 00:13:45.593\nthe delight and fascination\nthat we get from the world\n\n00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.193\nand being ourselves in it;\n\n00:13:47.816 --> 00:13:52.609\nthe richness that we get from seeing,\nfeeling and knowing the lives that we are.\n\n00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:54.652\nMy mom's an artist,\n\n00:13:54.676 --> 00:13:58.534\nand as a child, I'd often see her bring\nthings to life with the stroke of a brush.\n\n00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:01.166\nOne moment, it was\nall white space, pure possibility.\n\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.686\nThe next, it was alive\nwith her colorful ideas and expressions.\n\n00:14:05.415 --> 00:14:10.260\nAs I sat easel-side, watching her\ntransform canvas after canvas,\n\n00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:13.676\nI learned that you could\ncreate your own world.\n\n00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:16.995\nI learned that our own inner worlds --\n\n00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:20.159\nour ideas, emotions and imaginations --\n\n00:14:20.183 --> 00:14:22.934\nwere, in fact, not bound\nby our brains and bodies.\n\n00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:26.809\nIf you could think it,\nif you could discover it,\n\n00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.546\nyou could bring it to life.\n\n00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:31.934\nTo me, thought-controlled computing\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.361\nis as simple and powerful\nas a paintbrush --\n\n00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:37.933\none more tool to unlock and enliven\nthe hidden worlds within us.\n\n00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:43.190\nI look forward to the day\nthat I can sit beside you, easel-side,\n\n00:14:43.748 --> 00:14:47.863\nwatching the world that we can create\nwith our new toolboxes\n\n00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.933\nand the discoveries\nthat we can make about ourselves.\n\n00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.657\nThank you.\n\n00:14:53.681 --> 00:14:55.481\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The council of dads", "duration": "1233", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_the_council_of_dads", "transcript": "My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia. And this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after Confederate war generals. We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard. And when I was five, my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle. It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan. That's why they were called ape hangers. They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s, which I'm sure my mom didn't know. And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away. And I came back, and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly, so I decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood, and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan. My mangled body flew in one direction, my mangled bike flew in the other. And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line, and one of my neighbors came running over. \"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?\" she said, using the name of my older brother. (Laughter) \"I'm Bruce,\" I said, and promptly passed out.I broke my left femur that day \u2014 it's the largest bone in your body \u2014 and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee, and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle. And for the next 38 years, that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me. In fact, I made a living by walking. I traveled around the world, entered different cultures, wrote a series of books about my travels, including \"Walking the Bible.\" I hosted a television show by that name on PBS. I was, for all the world, the \"walking guy.\" Until, in May 2008, a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones. And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan, which showed that there was some growth in my left leg. That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI. And one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor. \"The tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor.\" I stopped walking, and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative. I have cancer. And to think that the tumor was in the same bone, in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier \u2014 it seemed like too much of a coincidence.So that afternoon, I went back to my house, and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler, came running to meet me. They'd just turned three, and they were into all things pink and purple. In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious \u2014 although I must say, our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday, April 15th. When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46 on April 15, 2005, our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch, and was like, \"Hmm, April 15th \u2014 tax day. Early filer and late filer.\" (Laughter) The next day I came to see him. I was like, \"Doctor, that was a really good joke.\" And he was like, \"You're the writer, kid.\" Anyway \u2014 so they had just turned three, and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground, laughing with all the glee in the world. I crumbled. I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them, the art projects I might not mess up, the boyfriends I might not scowl at, the aisles I might not walk down. Would they wonder who I was, I thought. Would they yearn for my approval, my love, my voice?A few days later, I woke with an idea of how I might give them that voice. I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters' lives. \"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,\" I wrote these men. \"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes, but they may not have me. They may not have their dad. Will you help be their dad?\" And I said to myself I would call this group of men \"the Council of Dads.\"Now as soon as I had this idea, I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. She's a very upbeat, naturally excited person. There's this idea in this culture \u2014 I don't have to tell you \u2014 that you sort of \"happy\" your way through a problem. We should focus on the positive. My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston. She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality. She's got big hair \u2014 although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair, because if I say she has big hair, people will think she's from Texas. And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia, but not to have hair from Texas. And actually, in her defense, if she were here right now, she would point out that, when we got married in Georgia, there were three questions on the marriage certificate license, the third of which was, \"Are you related?\" (Laughter) I said, \"Look, in Georgia at least we want to know. In Arkansas they don't even ask.\" What I didn't tell her is, if she said, \"Yes,\" you could jump. You don't need the 30-day waiting period. Because you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea, but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her. And she loved the idea, but she quickly started rejecting my nominees. She was like, \"Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice.\" So it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends.(Laughter)So we decided that we needed a set of rules, and we came up with a number. And the first one was no family, only friends. We thought our family would already be there. Second, men only. We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives. And then third, sort of a dad for every side. We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing. So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. And rather than send it, I decided to read it to them in person. Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals. I sort of friend-married each of these guys.And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin. Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s. And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle. And I snuck out behind, and there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows. And Jeff came up beside me and said, \"So, have you ever been cow tipping?\" I was like, \"Cow tipping? He was like, \"Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. So if you approach them from behind, down wind, you can push them over and they go thud in the mud.\" So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not, we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence, we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor, dozing cow.So a few weeks after my diagnosis, we went up to Vermont, and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads. And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter. \"Will you help be their dad?\" And I got to the end \u2014 he was crying and I was crying \u2014 and then he looked at me, and he said, \"Yes.\" I was like, \"Yes?\" I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. And frankly, although I keep getting asked this, it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances. And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book. And that was, \"What's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls?\"And Jeff's advice was, \"Be a traveller, not a tourist. Get off the bus. Seek out what's different. Approach the cow.\" \"So it's 10 years from now,\" I said, \"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here. What would you tell them?\" He said, \"I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle. You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple, or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like, what it smells like.\" And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland \u2014 the glint that says, \"Let's go cow tipping,\" even though we never did tip the cow, even though no one tips the cow, even though cows don't sleep standing up. He said, \"I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience, covered in mud.\"Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma. Eighty-five percent are under 21. Only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases. Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped, and there was a 15 percent survival rate. And then in the 1980's, they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective, and within weeks I had started that regimen. And since we are in a medical room, I went through four and a half months of chemo. Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin and very high-dose Methotrexate.And then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. And if you did see the Sanjay special, you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis. Then he took my fibula from my calf, cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh, where it now lives. And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf and re-vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip. And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. And my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo. It was, as we said in my house, a lost year.Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares. And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house, sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of \u2014 I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland \u2014 of William Sloane Coffin \u2014 it made me think of it. Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system. And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body. And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughters, at that time three and a half, were missing me and feeling my absence. And I hung up the phone, and I put my face in my hands, and I screamed this silent scream. And what you said, Dr. Nuland \u2014 I don't know where you are \u2014 made me think of this today. Because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that I had was like a primal scream.And what was so striking \u2014 and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today \u2014 is the experience. As I became less and less human \u2014 and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now. Of course, I had no hair and no immune system. They were actually putting blood inside my body. At that moment I was less and less human, I was also, at the same time, maybe the most human I've ever been. And what was so striking about that time was, instead of repulsing people, I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. People were incredibly drawn. When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck. Instead, it was everybody running the other way. And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way. Instead, it was all-hands-on-deck. And when people came to me, rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw \u2014 I was like a living ghost \u2014 they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives.Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy. It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate, to enter the most vital arenas of human life, the most sensitive and the most frightening, the ones that we never want to go to, but when we do go there, we feel incredibly transformed when we do. And this also happened to my girls as they began to see, and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate. One day, my daughter Tybee, Tybee came to me, and she said, \"I have so much love for you in my body, daddy, I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk, because that's where love comes from.\" (Laughter) And one night my daughter Eden came to me. And as I lifted my leg out of bed, she reached for my crutches and handed them to me. In fact, if I cling to one memory of this year, it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand. I didn't need the crutch anymore, I was walking on air.And one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people. And it made me think \u2014 and I'll just note for the record \u2014 one word that I've only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday \u2014 the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word \"friend.\" And yet from everything we've been talking about \u2014 compliance, or addiction, or weight loss \u2014 we now know that community is important, and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in. And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me. And one of the things that I learned is that over time, particularly men, who used to be non-communicative, are becoming more and more communicative. And that particularly happened \u2014 there was one in my life \u2014 is this Council of Dads that Linda said, what we were talking about, it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.And no one captures this modern manhood to me more than David Black. Now David is my literary agent. He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day, standing fully upright in cowboy boots. And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone \u2014 I can say this I guess because you've done it here \u2014 he answers the phone, \"Yo, motherfucker.\" He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine, and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car \u2014 although, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th. But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes, he leaves work early to coach Little League. Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads. I was like, \"David cries when you invite him to take a walk.\" (Laughter) But he's a literary agent, which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true. And this is what we wanted him to capture \u2014 what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. And I said, \"What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?\" And he said, \"A belief in themselves.\" \"But when I came to see you,\" I said, \"I didn't believe in myself. I was at a wall.\" He said, \"I don't see the wall,\" and I'm telling you the same, Don't see the wall. You may encounter one from time to time, but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it. But whatever you do, don't succumb to it. Don't give in to the wall.My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge, and during the year and a half I was on crutches, it became a sort of symbol to me. So one day near the end of my journey, I said, \"Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.\" We set out on crutches. I was on crutches, my wife was next to me, my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead. And because walking was one of the first things I lost, I spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts. Walking upright, we are told, is the threshold of what made us human. And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright, the act is essentially unchanged. As my physical therapist likes to say, \"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.\" You nearly fall with one leg, then you catch yourself with the other. And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches \u2014 as I did for a year and a half \u2014 is that you walk slower. You hurry, you get where you're going, but you get there alone. You go slow, you get where you're going, but you get there with this community you built along the way.At the risk of admission, I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches. 200 years ago, a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris. He was called a \"flaneur,\" one who wanders the arcades. And it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace. And I just love this ode to slow moving. And it's become my own motto for my girls. Take a walk with a turtle. Behold the world in pause. And this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.There's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell, and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus, that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow. And every seven sets of seven years, the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. That 50th year is called the jubilee year, and it's the origin of that term. And though I'm shy of 50, it captures my own experience. My lost year was my jubilee year. By laying fallow, I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones I love.Come the one year anniversary of my journey, I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey \u2014 and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor. He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage, which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard. And I said, \"Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day and say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?' what would you tell them?\" He said, \"I would tell them what I know, and that is everybody dies, but not everybody lives. I want you to live.\"I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book, \"The Council of Dads,\" and I listed these lessons, a few of which you've heard here today: Approach the cow, pack your flipflops, don't see the wall, live the questions, harvest miracles. As I looked at this list \u2014 to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living \u2014 I realized, we may have done it for our girls, but it really changed us. And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads, is that my wife and I did this in an attempt to help our daughters, but it really changed us.So I stand here today as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane. And last week I had my 18-month scans. And as you all know, anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans. In my case it's quarterly. And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say, can never find a solution for scan-xiety. As I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say depending on what happened here. I got good news that day, and I stand here today cancer-free, walking without aid and hobbling forward.And I just want to mention briefly in passing \u2014 I'm past my time limit \u2014 but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is, at a similar meeting, back in the spring, Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly \u2014 in a span of three weeks \u2014 put the full resources of 23andMe, and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody, a living person with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma. And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it, we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program. And the epidemiologists here will tell you, that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. So if you go to 23andMe, or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link. And we encourage anybody to join this effort.But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message: May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal, or to that college roommate, or to some person you may have turned away from. May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace, or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. And every now and then, find a friend, find a turtle, and take a long, slow walk.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1062, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nMy story actually began when I was four years old\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nand my family moved to a new neighborhood\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nin our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nAnd this was the 1960s\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nwhen actually all the streets in this neighborhood\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nwere named after Confederate war generals.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nWe lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd when I was five,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nmy parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nIt had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthat made the rider look like an orangutan.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nThat's why they were called ape hangers.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nThey were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nwhich I'm sure my mom didn't know.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nhidden away a few streets away.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nAnd I came back,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nso I decided to turn around in this big street\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthat intersected our neighborhood,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nand wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nMy mangled body flew in one direction,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nmy mangled bike flew in the other.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand one of my neighbors came running over.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\n\"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?\" she said, using the name of my older brother.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\n\"I'm Bruce,\" I said, and promptly passed out.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nI broke my left femur that day --\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nit's the largest bone in your body --\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nand spent the next two months in a body cast\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthat went from my chin to the tip of my toe\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nto my right knee,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand a steel bar went from my right knee\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nto my left ankle.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd for the next 38 years,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nthat accident was the only medically interesting thing\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nthat ever happened to me.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nIn fact, I made a living by walking.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nI traveled around the world, entered different cultures,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nwrote a series of books about my travels,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nincluding \"Walking the Bible.\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nI hosted a television show by that name\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\non PBS.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI was, for all the world, the \"walking guy.\"\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nUntil, in May 2008,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\na routine visit to my doctor\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand a routine blood test\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nproduced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat something might be wrong with my bones.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nwhich showed that there was some growth in my left leg.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThat sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nAnd one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\n\"The tumor in your leg\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nis not consistent with a benign tumor.\"\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI stopped walking,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nand it took my mind a second to convert that double negative\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\ninto a much more horrifying negative.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nI have cancer.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nAnd to think that the tumor was in the same bone,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nin the same place in my body\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nas the accident 38 years earlier --\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nit seemed like too much of a coincidence.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nSo that afternoon, I went back to my house,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\ncame running to meet me.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThey'd just turned three,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand they were into all things pink and purple.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nIn fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nalthough I must say, our favorite nickname\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\noccurred on their birthday, April 15th.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nWhen they were born at 6:14 and 6:46\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\non April 15, 2005,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nour otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand was like, \"Hmm, April 15th -- tax day.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nEarly filer and late filer.\"\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThe next day I came to see him. I was like, \"Doctor, that was a really good joke.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd he was like, \"You're the writer, kid.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnyway -- so they had just turned three,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwhere they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nlaughing with all the glee in the world.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nI crumbled.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nthe art projects I might not mess up,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthe boyfriends I might not scowl at,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe aisles I might not walk down.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWould they wonder who I was, I thought.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nWould they yearn for my approval,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nmy love, my voice?\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nA few days later, I woke with an idea\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nof how I might give them that voice.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nI would reach out to six men\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nfrom all parts of my life\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand ask them to be present\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nin the passages of my daughters' lives.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\n\"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,\"\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nI wrote these men.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\n\"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nbut they may not have me.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThey may not have their dad.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWill you help be their dad?\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd I said to myself\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nI would call this group of men \"the Council of Dads.\"\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nNow as soon as I had this idea,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nShe's a very upbeat,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nnaturally excited person.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThere's this idea in this culture -- I don't have to tell you --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthat you sort of \"happy\" your way through a problem.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWe should focus on the positive.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nMy wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nShe's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nShe's got big hair --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nalthough, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nbecause if I say she has big hair,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\npeople will think she's from Texas.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nbut not to have hair from Texas.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nshe would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthere were three questions\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\non the marriage certificate license,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthe third of which was, \"Are you related?\"\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nI said, \"Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nIn Arkansas they don't even ask.\"\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nWhat I didn't tell her is, if she said, \"Yes,\" you could jump.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nYou don't need the 30-day waiting period.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBecause you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nSo I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nbut the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd she loved the idea,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut she quickly started rejecting my nominees.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nShe was like, \"Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice.\"\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo it turned out that starting a council of dads\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwas a very efficient way to find out\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nwhat my wife really thought of my friends.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo we decided that we needed a set of rules,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand we came up with a number.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd the first one was no family, only friends.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nWe thought our family would already be there.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSecond, men only.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nWe were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd then third, sort of a dad for every side.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWe kind of went through my personality\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd rather than send it,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nI decided to read it to them in person.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nLinda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nI sort of friend-married each of these guys.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nNow Jeff led this trip I took to Europe\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhen I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd I snuck out behind,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd Jeff came up beside me and said,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\n\"So, have you ever been cow tipping?\"\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nI was like, \"Cow tipping?\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nHe was like, \"Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSo if you approach them from behind, down wind,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nyou can push them over and they go thud in the mud.\"\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwe had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nwe were tiptoeing through the dung\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand approaching some poor, dozing cow.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo a few weeks after my diagnosis,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nwe went up to Vermont,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n\"Will you help be their dad?\"\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying --\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nand then he looked at me, and he said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nI was like, \"Yes?\"\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd frankly, although I keep getting asked this,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nit never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nunder the circumstances.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd that was, \"What's the one piece of advice\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nyou would give to my girls?\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd Jeff's advice was,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\n\"Be a traveller, not a tourist.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nGet off the bus. Seek out what's different.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nApproach the cow.\"\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\n\"So it's 10 years from now,\" I said,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n\"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nWhat would you tell them?\"\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nHe said, \"I would approach this journey\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nas a young child might approach a mud puddle.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nYou can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nor you can jump in and thrash around\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand see what it feels like, what it smells like.\"\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd as he talked he had that glint in his eye\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat I first saw back in Holland --\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthe glint that says, \"Let's go cow tipping,\"\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\neven though we never did tip the cow,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\neven though no one tips the cow,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\neven though cows don't sleep standing up.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nHe said, \"I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\ncovered in mud.\"\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nTwo weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nI had a seven-inch osteosarcoma\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nin my left femur.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSix hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nEighty-five percent are under 21.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nOnly a hundred adults a year\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nget one of these diseases.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nTwenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand there was a 15 percent survival rate.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd then in the 1980's, they determined\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthat one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand within weeks I had started that regimen.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd since we are in a medical room,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nI went through four and a half months of chemo.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nActually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand very high-dose Methotrexate.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAnd then I had a 15-hour surgery\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nin which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nat Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\ntook out my left femur\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand replaced it with titanium.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd if you did see the Sanjay special,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nyou saw these enormous screws\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nthat they screwed into my pelvis.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThen he took my fibula from my calf,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\ncut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhere it now lives.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand re-vascularized it in my thigh\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand then connected it\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nto the good parts of my knee and my hip.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThis is a surgery so rare\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nonly two human beings have survived it before me.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd my reward for surviving it\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwas to go back for four more months of chemo.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nIt was, as we said in my house,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\na lost year.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBecause in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nsat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nsitting on my desk.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of --\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI don't know where you are Dr. Nuland --\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nof William Sloane Coffin --\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nit made me think of it.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nBecause I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nwhen my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd one night I got a call from my mother-in-law\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthat my daughters, at that time three and a half,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwere missing me and feeling my absence.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd I hung up the phone,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand I put my face in my hands,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand I screamed this silent scream.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd what you said, Dr. Nuland -- I don't know where you are --\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nmade me think of this today.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nBecause the thought that came to my mind\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwas that the feeling that I had\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nwas like a primal scream.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAnd what was so striking --\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand one of the messages I want to leave you here with today --\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nis the experience.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAs I became less and less human --\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nOf course, I had no hair and no immune system.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nThey were actually putting blood inside my body.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAt that moment I was less and less human,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI was also, at the same time,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nmaybe the most human I've ever been.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd what was so striking about that time\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nwas, instead of repulsing people,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI was actually proving to be a magnet for people.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nPeople were incredibly drawn.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nWhen my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nInstead, it was everybody running the other way.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nInstead, it was all-hands-on-deck.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd when people came to me,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nrather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw --\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nI was like a living ghost --\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthey were incredibly moved\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto talk about what was going on in their own lives.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nCancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nIt is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nto enter the most vital arenas of human life,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nthe most sensitive and the most frightening,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nthe ones that we never want to go to,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nbut when we do go there,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwe feel incredibly transformed when we do.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nAnd this also happened to my girls as they began to see,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nOne day, my daughter Tybee,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nTybee came to me, and she said, \"I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nbecause that's where love comes from.\"\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd one night my daughter Eden came to me.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd as I lifted my leg out of bed,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nshe reached for my crutches and handed them to me.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nIn fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nit would be walking down a darkened hallway\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwith five spongy fingers\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\ngrasping the handle underneath my hand.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nI didn't need the crutch anymore,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI was walking on air.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd one of the profound things that happened\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwas this act of actually connecting to all these people.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record --\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\none word that I've only heard once actually\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwas when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday --\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthe one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nis the word \"friend.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAnd yet from everything we've been talking about --\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\ncompliance, or addiction, or weight loss --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nwe now know that community is important,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd there was something incredibly profound\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nabout sitting down with my closest friends\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand telling them what they meant to me.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd one of the things that I learned is that over time,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nparticularly men, who used to be non-communicative,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nare becoming more and more communicative.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd that particularly happened -- there was one in my life --\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nis this Council of Dads\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthat Linda said, what we were talking about,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nit's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd no one captures this modern manhood to me\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nmore than David Black.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nNow David is my literary agent.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nHe's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nstanding fully upright in cowboy boots.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nI can say this I guess because you've done it here --\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nhe answers the phone, \"Yo, motherfucker.\"\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nHe gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nand on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car --\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nalthough, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nBut like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nhe leaves work early to coach Little League.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nSomeone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nI was like, \"David cries when you invite him to take a walk.\"\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nBut he's a literary agent,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nwhich means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nAnd this is what we wanted him to capture --\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwhat it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd I said, \"What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?\"\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd he said, \"A belief in themselves.\"\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\n\"But when I came to see you,\" I said, \"I didn't believe in myself.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nI was at a wall.\"\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nHe said, \"I don't see the wall,\" and I'm telling you the same,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nDon't see the wall.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nYou may encounter one from time to time,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nbut you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nBut whatever you do, don't succumb to it.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nDon't give in to the wall.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nMy home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand during the year and a half I was on crutches,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nit became a sort of symbol to me.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo one day near the end of my journey,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nI said, \"Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.\"\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWe set out on crutches.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nI was on crutches, my wife was next to me,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nmy girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd because walking was one of the first things I lost,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nI spent most of that year\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nthinking about this most elemental of human acts.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWalking upright, we are told,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nis the threshold of what made us human.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nthe act is essentially unchanged.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAs my physical therapist likes to say,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\n\"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nYou nearly fall with one leg,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthen you catch yourself with the other.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nAnd the biggest consequence of walking on crutches --\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nas I did for a year and a half --\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nis that you walk slower.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nYou hurry,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nyou get where you're going, but you get there alone.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nYou go slow, you get where you're going,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nbut you get there with this community\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nyou built along the way.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nAt the risk of admission, I was never nicer\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nthan the year I was on crutches.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\n200 years ago,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\na new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nHe was called a \"flaneur,\" one who wanders the arcades.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd it was the custom of those flaneurs\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nto show they were men of leisure\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nby taking turtles for walks\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nand letting the reptile set the pace.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nAnd I just love this ode to slow moving.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd it's become my own motto for my girls.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nTake a walk with a turtle.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nBehold the world in pause.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd this idea of pausing\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nmay be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nThere's a quote from Moses\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\non the side of the Liberty Bell,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nand it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nthat every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nAnd every seven sets of seven years,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nthe land gets an extra year of rest\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nduring which time all families are reunited\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nand people surrounded with the ones they love.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nThat 50th year is called the jubilee year,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nand it's the origin of that term.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nAnd though I'm shy of 50,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nit captures my own experience.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nMy lost year was my jubilee year.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nBy laying fallow,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nI planted the seeds for a healthier future\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nand was reunited with the ones I love.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nCome the one year anniversary of my journey,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nI went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey --\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nand by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nHe's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nwhich is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nAnd I said, \"Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nand say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?'\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nwhat would you tell them?\"\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nHe said, \"I would tell them what I know,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nand that is everybody dies,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nbut not everybody lives.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nI want you to live.\"\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nI wrote a letter to my girls\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nthat appears at the end of my book, \"The Council of Dads,\"\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nand I listed these lessons,\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\na few of which you've heard here today:\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nApproach the cow, pack your flipflops,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\ndon't see the wall,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nlive the questions,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nharvest miracles.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAs I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living --\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nI realized, we may have done it for our girls,\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nbut it really changed us.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nAnd that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nis that my wife and I did this\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nin an attempt to help our daughters,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nbut it really changed us.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nSo I stand here

00:18:32.958\nAnd as you all know,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nanybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nIn my case it's quarterly.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nAnd all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\ncan never find a solution for scan-xiety.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nAs I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\ndepending on what happened here.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nI got good news that day,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nand I stand here today cancer-free,\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nwalking without aid\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nand hobbling forward.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nAnd I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit --\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nbut I just want to briefly mention in passing\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nthat one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nis, at a similar meeting,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nback in the spring,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nAnne Wojcicki heard about our story\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nand very quickly -- in a span of three weeks --\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nput the full resources of 23andMe,\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nand we announced an initiative in July\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nto get to decode the genome\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nof anybody, a living person\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nwith a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nAnd she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nwe've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nAnd the epidemiologists here will tell you,\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nthat's half the number of people who get the disease\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nin one year in the United States.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nSo if you go to 23andMe,\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nor if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nAnd we encourage anybody to join this effort.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nBut I'll just close what I've been talking about\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nby leaving you with this message:\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nMay you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nor to that college roommate,\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nor to some person you may have turned away from.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nMay you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nor find a way to get over, around, or through any wall\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nthat stands between you and one of your dreams.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nAnd every now and then,\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nfind a friend, find a turtle,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nand take a long, slow walk.\n\n00:20:10.958 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/kate_orff_oysters_as_architecture", "transcript": "I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land, from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan, has really shaped our history and our character. But one thing is clear. In the last 100 years alone, our country \u2014 and this is a sprawl map of America \u2014 our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet. And so, how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them. This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment. And it's really a conflux of urban population rising, biodiversity plummeting and also, of course, sea levels rising and climate changing.So when I also think about design, I think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. And you can see from the arrow here indicating \"you are here,\" I'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology, and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way. So the era of big infrastructure is over. I mean, these sort of top-down, mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. We need new tools and new approaches. Similarly, the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field, devoid of context, is really not the \u2014 excuse me, it's fairly blatant \u2014 is really not the approach that we need to take. So we need new stories, new heroes and new tools.So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war, and that is the eastern oyster. So, albeit a very small creature and very modest, this creature is incredible, because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures. It can grow; you can grow it; and \u2014 did I mention? \u2014 it's quite tasty. So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called \"oyster-tecture.\" And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels, eelgrass and oysters \u2014 species that live in the harbor \u2014 and, at the same time, harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now.Here's a map of my city, New York City, showing inundation in red. And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about, the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. If you look here at this map, showing everything in blue is out in the water, and everything in yellow is upland. But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly \u2014 I will admit it. There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination, but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition, and it's a condition that we're all facing. And here's a map of that condition, showing the contaminants in yellow and green, exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise. So we really had a lot to deal with.When we started this project, one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there. And you can see from this map, there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement. We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept, harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern. And the idea has two core stages. One is to develop a new artificial ecology, a reef out in the harbor, that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. Because if you have cleaner water and slower water, you can imagine a new way of living with that water.So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way, I think. Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster. And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal. It accepts algae and detritus in one end, and through this beautiful, glamorous set of stomach organs, out the other end comes cleaner water. And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day. Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. They were key in our culture and our economy. Basically, New York was built on the backs of oystermen, and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. This image is an image of an oyster cart, which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. So again, we got the short end of the deal there. (Laughter) Finally, oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures. They really become nature's wave attenuators. And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. Many, many species depend on them.So we were inspired by the oyster, but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water, and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster, to an adult male oyster or female oyster, in a number of weeks. We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus, then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive.How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple. A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that \u2014 the answers won't land down from the Moon. And with a $20 billion price tag, we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. So this image is simply showing \u2014 it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope. What is fuzzy rope, you ask? It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing, available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap. So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project. (Laughter) So in the studio, rather than drawing, we began to learn how to knit. The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change.It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think, new amphibious public space, where you can imagine working, you can imagine recreating in a new way. In the end, what we realized we were making was a new blue-green watery park for the next watery century \u2014 an amphibious park, if you will. So get your Tevas on. So you can imagine scuba diving here. This is an image of high school students, scuba divers that we worked with on our team. So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water, and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring.Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world: this is the word \"flupsy\" \u2014 it's short for \"floating upwelling system.\" And this glorious, readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. So the water is churned through this raft. You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them. So rather than having 10 oysters, you have 10,000 oysters. And then those spat are then seeded. Here's the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines \u2014 the flupsification of the Gowanus. New word. And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges. And finally, how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef.I get asked two questions about this project. One is: why isn't it happening now? And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters? And the answer is: not yet, they're working. But we imagine, with our calculations, that by 2050, you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.To conclude, this is just one cross-section of one piece of city, but my dream is, my hope is, that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable, a more livable and a more delicious future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1064, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI am passionate about the American

incredible geographical signature\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nof a series of islands\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nthat were out in the harbor\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand a matrix of salt marshes and beaches\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthat served as natural wave attenuation\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nfor the upland settlement.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nWe also learned at this time\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nin the Gowanus Canal itself.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nSo our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nharnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd the idea has two core stages.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nOne is to develop a new artificial ecology,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\na reef out in the harbor,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthat would then protect new settlement patterns\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\ninland and the Gowanus.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBecause if you have cleaner water and slower water,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nyou can imagine a new way of living with that water.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo the project really addresses these three core issues\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nin a new and exciting way, I think.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nHere we are, back to our hero, the oyster.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nIt accepts algae and detritus in one end,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand through this beautiful, glamorous\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nset of stomach organs,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nout the other end comes cleaner water.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nOyster reefs also covered\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout a quarter of our harbor\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nand were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThey were key in our culture and our economy.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nBasically, New York was built\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\non the backs of oystermen,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand our streets were literally built over oyster shells.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThis image\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nis an image of an oyster cart,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwhich is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo again, we got the short end of the deal there.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nFinally, oysters can attenuate\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand agglomerate onto each other\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand form these amazing natural reef structures.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThey really become nature's wave attenuators.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd they become the bedrock\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nof any harbor ecosystem.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nMany, many species depend on them.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo we were inspired by the oyster,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nbut I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt can move from a fertilized egg\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nto an adult male oyster or female oyster,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nin a number of weeks.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nWe reinterpreted this life cycle\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\non the scale of our sight\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand took the Gowanus\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nas a giant oyster nursery\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwhere oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nthen paraded down in their spat stage\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nand seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd so the core idea here\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nwas to hit the reset button\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand regenerate an ecology over time\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat was regenerative and cleaning\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand productive.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nHow does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nA core concept here\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nis that climate change\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nisn't something that --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthe answers won't land down from the Moon.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd with a $20 billion price tag,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nwe should simply start and get to work with what we have now\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand what's in front of us.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo this image is simply showing --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nit's a field of marine piles\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\ninterconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat is fuzzy rope, you ask?\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\navailable practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo we imagine that we would actually\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\npotentially even host a bake sale\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nto start our new project.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo in the studio, rather than drawing,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwe began to learn how to knit.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nThe concept was to really knit this rope together\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand develop this new soft infrastructure\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nfor the oysters to grow on.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nYou can see in the diagram how it grows over time\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nfrom an infrastructural space\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\ninto a new public urban space.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd that grows over time dynamically\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwith the threat of climate change.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nIt also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nnew amphibious public space,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhere you can imagine working,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nyou can imagine recreating in a new way.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIn the end, what we realized we were making\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nwas a new blue-green watery park\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nfor the next watery century --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nan amphibious park, if you will.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nSo get your Tevas on.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nSo you can imagine scuba diving here.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThis is an image of high school students,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nscuba divers that we worked with on our team.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo you can imagine a sort of new manner of living\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwith a new relationship with the water,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin terms of monitoring.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnother new vocabulary word for the brave new world:\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthis is the word \"flupsy\" --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nit's short for \"floating upwelling system.\"\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd this glorious, readily available device\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nis basically a floating raft\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwith an oyster nursery below.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo the water is churned through this raft.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nYou can see the eight chambers on the side\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nhost little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nSo rather than having 10 oysters,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nyou have 10,000 oysters.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd then those spat are then seeded.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nHere's the Gowanus future\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwith the oyster rafts on the shorelines --\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthe flupsification of the Gowanus.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nNew word.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd also showing oyster gardening for the community\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nalong its edges.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd finally, how much fun it would be\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nto watch the flupsy parade\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand cheer on the oyster spats\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nas they go down to the reef.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nI get asked two questions about this project.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nOne is: why isn't it happening now?\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd the answer is: not yet, they're working.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nBut we imagine, with our calculations,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat by 2050,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nyou might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nTo conclude, this is just one cross-section\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nof one piece of city,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbut my dream is, my hope is,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nthat when you all go back to your own cities\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthat we can start to work together and collaborate\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\non remaking and reforming\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\na new urban landscape\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\ntowards a more sustainable, a more livable\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand a more delicious future.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThank you.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "We are makers", "duration": "707", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dale_dougherty_we_are_makers", "transcript": "I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it, and that is all of us are makers. I really believe that. All of us are makers. We're born makers. We have this ability to make things, to grasp things with our hands. We use words like \"grasp\" metaphorically to also think about understanding things. We don't just live, but we make. We create things. Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. It doesn't come out particularly well, but that's a particularly tall bicycle. It's a scraper bike; it's called \u2014 from Oakland. And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. But he's trying to power it, or motorize it, with a drill. (Laughter) And the question he had is, \"Can I do it? Can it be done?\" Apparently it can. So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs; they're people who love doing what they do. They don't always even know why they're doing it.We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire. There was one held in Detroit here last summer, and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford. But we hold them in San Francisco \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 and in New York. And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation.(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.Guy: Where did you guys get those?Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. We got there first.Lady: Will you glide with us?DD: This is something I call \"swinging in the rain.\" And you can barely see it, but it's \u2014 a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. So imagine a kid: \"Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet? No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?\" That's the experience of a clever ride. And of course, we have fashion. People are remaking things into fashion. I don't know if this is called a basket-bra, but it ought to be something like that. We have art students getting together, taking old radiator parts and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it. They did that in the summer, and it was very warm.Now this one takes a little bit of explaining. You know what those are, right? Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that. Now the background is \u2014 the guy who did this is a physicist. And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter, and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.Choir: \u266b When you hold me in your arms \u266bDD: This is all computer-controlled in an old Volvo.Choir: \u266b I'm hooked on a feelin' \u266b \u266b I'm high on believin' \u266b \u266b That you're in love with me \u266bDD: So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. So, are you a maker? How many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand? That's a pretty good \u2014 but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers. And again, think about it. You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter; you're makers of lots of different things, and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world, and particularly the role that technology has in your life. You're really a driver or a passenger \u2014 to use a Volkswagen phrase. Makers are in control. That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. They want to figure out how things work; they want to get access to it; and they want to control it. They want to use it to their own purpose.Makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge. They're not mainstream. They're a little bit radical. They're a bit subversive in what they do. But at one time, it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker. It was not something you'd even remark upon. And I found this old video. And I'll tell you more about it, but just ...(Music)(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are, we are makers. With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion. Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers.DD: So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood, a grandfather making a ship in a bottle, a woman making a pie \u2014 somewhat standard fare of the day. But it was a sense of pride that we made things, that the world around us was made by us. It didn't just exist. We made it, and we were connected to it that way. And I think that's tremendously important. Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. This particular reel \u2014 it's an industrial video \u2014 but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 \u2014 in the Detroit area, in fact \u2014 and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho.\" (Laughter) So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this, plus \"Psycho.\"This is Andrew Archer. I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth, Minnesota. And I talked to his mom, and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot. He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. He liked to take things apart. His mother gave him a part of the garage, and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff. And then he didn't particularly like school that much, but he got involved in robotics competitions, and he realized he had a talent, and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it. And he began building robots. And when I sat down next to him, he was telling me about a company he formed, and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. And that's why he moved to Michigan. But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing. And this kind of gets to this important idea today.This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last. But these are like clubs \u2014 they're sharing tools, sharing space, sharing expertise in what to make. And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. Let me say that again: playing. They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. They're playing to discover what the technology can do, and probably to discover what they can do themselves, what their own capabilities are.Now the other thing that I think is taking off, another reason making is taking off today, is there's some great new tools out there. And you can't see this very well on the screen, but Arduino \u2014 Arduino is an open-source hardware platform. It's a micro-controller. If you don't know what those are, they're just the \"brains.\" So they're the brains of maker projects, and here's an example of one. And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox \u2014 so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. So you figure out how to program this, and you put this in your mailbox. And when someone opens your mailbox, you get a notification, an alert message goes to your iPhone. Now that could be a dog door, it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't, like a little brother into a little sister's room. There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that.Now here's something \u2014 a 3D printer. That's another tool that's really taken off \u2014 really, really interesting. This is Makerbot. And there are industrial versions of this \u2014 about 20,000 dollars. These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars, and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers. Now they don't know what they want to do with it, but they're going to figure it out. They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade, some new brackets for the box. Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. Isn't that cool?So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. And they do interesting things. They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think \u2014 the military is doing drones \u2014 well, there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes, or vehicles \u2014 something that you could program to fly on its own, without a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going. Fascinating work they're doing.We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration. This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars. Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space. In fact, these guys actually work for NASA, and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components, cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space.Makers are a source of innovation, and I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry. This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers? It's the Homebrew Computer Club \u2014 just like a hackerspace. And he says, \"I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free.\" Well he did a little bit better than free. But it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries \u2014 even like Henry Ford \u2014 come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups.Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker, I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers, that kids are particularly interested in this, in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro-controllers and build robots. And we've got to get this into schools, or into communities in many, many ways \u2014 the ability to tinker, to shape and reshape the world around us. There's a great opportunity today \u2014 and that's what I really care about the most. An the answer to the question: what will America make? It's more makers.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1065, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm going to have a pretty simple idea\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nthat I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nand that is all of us are makers.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nI really believe that.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nAll of us are makers.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nWe're born makers.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nWe have this ability\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nto make things,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nto grasp things with our hands.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nWe use words like \"grasp\" metaphorically\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nto also think about understanding things.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nWe don't just live, but we make.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nWe create things.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nWell I'm going to show you a group of makers\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nfrom Maker Faire and various places.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nIt doesn't come out particularly well,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nbut that's a particularly tall bicycle.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIt's a scraper bike; it's called --\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nfrom Oakland.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nAnd this is a particularly small scooter\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nfor a gentleman of this size.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nBut he's trying to power it, or motorize it,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nwith a drill.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd the question he had is,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\n\"Can I do it? Can it be done?\"\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nApparently it can.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nSo makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthey're people who love\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\ndoing what they do.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nThey don't always even know why they're doing it.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nWe have begun organizing makers\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nat our Maker Faire.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nThere was one held in Detroit here last summer,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nBut we hold them in San Francisco --\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\n-- and in New York.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nAnd it's a fabulous event\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nto just meet and talk to these people who make things\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand are there to just show them to you and talk about them\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nand have a great conversation.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\n(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nDale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nGuy: Where did you guys get those?\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nMuffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nDD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nWe got there first.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nLady: Will you glide with us?\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nDD: This is something I call \"swinging in the rain.\"\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd you can barely see it,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbut it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\njust before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo imagine a kid: \"Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNo, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?\"\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThat's the experience of a clever ride.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd of course, we have fashion.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nPeople are remaking things into fashion.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI don't know if this is called a basket-bra,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nbut it ought to be something like that.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nWe have art students getting together,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\ntaking old radiator parts\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThey did that in the summer, and it was very warm.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nNow this one takes a little bit of explaining.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nYou know what those are, right?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nBilly-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nNow the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\n(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nChoir: \u266b When you hold me in your arms \u266b\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nDD: This is all computer-controlled\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin an old Volvo.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nChoir: \u266b I'm hooked on a feelin' \u266b\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:18.958\n\u266b I'm high on believin' \u266b\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\n\u266b That you're in love with me \u266b\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nDD: So Richard came up from Houston last year\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nto visit us in Detroit here\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nSo, are you a maker?\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nHow many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThat's a pretty good --\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nbut there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd again, think about it.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nYou're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nyou're makers of lots of different things,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand partly what interests me today\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nis you're makers of your own world,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand particularly the role that technology has\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin your life.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nYou're really a driver or a passenger --\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nto use a Volkswagen phrase.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nMakers are in control.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThat's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThey want to figure out how things work;\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthey want to get access to it;\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand they want to control it.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThey want to use it to their own purpose.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nMakers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThey're not mainstream.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThey're a little bit radical.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThey're a bit subversive in what they do.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBut at one time,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nit was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nIt was not something you'd even remark upon.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd I found this old video.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd I'll tell you more about it, but just ...\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\n(Music)\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\n(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nwe are makers.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWith our strengths and our minds and spirit,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwe gather, we form, and we fashion.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nMakers and shapers\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand put-it-togetherers.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nDD: So it goes on to show you\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\npeople making things out of wood,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\na grandfather making a ship in a bottle,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\na woman making a pie --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nsomewhat standard fare of the day.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBut it was a sense of pride\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthat we made things,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nthat the world around us was made by us.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIt didn't just exist.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nWe made it, and we were connected to it that way.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd I think that's tremendously important.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nNow I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThis particular reel --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nit's an industrial video --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbut it was shown in drive-in theaters\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nin 1961 --\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nin the Detroit area, in fact --\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho.\"\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nSo I like to think there was something going on there\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nof the new generation of makers\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\ncoming out of this, plus \"Psycho.\"\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nThis is Andrew Archer.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI met Andrew at one of our community meetings\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nputting together Maker Faire.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAndrew had moved to Detroit\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nfrom Duluth, Minnesota.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd I talked to his mom,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand I ended up doing a story on him\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nfor a magazine called Kidrobot.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nHe's just a kid that grew up\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nplaying with tools instead of toys.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nHe liked to take things apart.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nHis mother gave him a part of the garage,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd then he didn't particularly like school that much,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut he got involved in robotics competitions,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand he realized he had a talent,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd he began building robots.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd when I sat down next to him,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nhe was telling me about a company he formed,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand he was building some robots for automobile factories\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nto move things around on the factory floor.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd that's why he moved to Michigan.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut he also moved here\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nto meet other people doing what he's doing.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd this kind of gets to this important idea today.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThis is Jeff and Bilal and several others here\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nin a hackerspace.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nBut these are like clubs --\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthey're sharing tools, sharing space,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nsharing expertise in what to make.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd so it's a very interesting phenomenon\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nthat's going across the world.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nBut essentially these are people that are playing with technology.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nLet me say that again: playing.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThey don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThey're playing\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto discover what the technology can do,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand probably to discover what they can do themselves,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhat their own capabilities are.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nNow the other thing that I think is taking off,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nanother reason making is taking off today,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis there's some great new tools out there.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd you can't see this very well on the screen,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbut Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt's a micro-controller.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nIf you don't know what those are, they're just the \"brains.\"\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nSo they're the brains of maker projects,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand here's an example of one.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox --\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nso an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nSo you figure out how to program this,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand you put this in your mailbox.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd when someone opens your mailbox,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nyou get a notification,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nan alert message goes to your iPhone.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nNow that could be a dog door,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nit could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nlike a little brother into a little sister's room.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThere's all kinds of different things\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthat you can imagine for that.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nNow here's something -- a 3D printer.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThat's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThis is Makerbot.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd there are industrial versions of this --\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nabout 20,000 dollars.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThese guys came up with a kit version\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nfor 750 dollars,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\ncan get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nNow they don't know what they want to do with it,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nbut they're going to figure it out.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThey will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nOne of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nsome new brackets for the box.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWell you printed out the brackets\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIsn't that cool?\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nSo makers harvest technology\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nfrom all the places around us.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nThis is a radar speed detector\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd they do interesting things.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nThey're really creating new areas and exploring areas\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthat you might only think --\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthe military is doing drones --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwell, there is a whole community of people\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nbuilding autonomous airplanes, or vehicles --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nsomething that you could program to fly on its own,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwithout a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nFascinating work they're doing.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nWe just had an issue on space exploration,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nDIY space exploration.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThis is probably the best time in the history of mankind\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nto love space.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nYou could build your own satellite and get it into space\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nfor like 8,000 dollars.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThink how much money and how many years it took NASA\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto get satellites into space.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nIn fact, these guys actually work for NASA,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\ncheap things that aren't specialized\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat they can combine\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand send up into space.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nMakers are a source of innovation,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand I think it relates back to something\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nlike the birth of the personal computer industry.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThis is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nIt's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd he says, \"I could go there all day long\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand talk to people\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand share ideas for free.\"\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWell he did a little bit better than free.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nBut it's important to understand\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthat a lot of the origins of our industries --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\neven like Henry Ford --\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\ncome from this idea of playing\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nand figuring things out in groups.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWell, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nI hope I could convince you\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat our next generation should be makers,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nthat kids are particularly interested in this,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nin this ability to control the physical world\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand be able to use things like micro-controllers\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand build robots.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd we've got to get this into schools,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nor into communities in many, many ways --\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nthe ability to tinker,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nto shape and reshape the world around us.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThere's a great opportunity today --\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand that's what I really care about the most.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAn the answer to the question: what will America make?\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nIt's more makers.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Social media and the end of gender", "duration": "507", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_social_media_and_the_end_of_gender", "transcript": "I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy: social media and the end of gender. Let me connect the dots. I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love, or love to hate, are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender.If you hadn't noticed, our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender, and I think that's going to change. Now most media companies \u2014 television, radio, publishing, games, you name it \u2014 they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences. It's old-school demographics. They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways \u2014 you have certain taste, that you like certain things. And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics.Age demographics: the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s, when the baby boomers were still young. Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54. In our media environment, it's as if they don't even exist. Now, if you watch \"Mad Men,\" like I do \u2014 it's a popular TV show in the States \u2014 Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics, which first came about in the 1960s, where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers. But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. It's really just been basic demographics.So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC, and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. And in the last three years, we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed, and we've discovered some very interesting things. All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. But those categories mean even less now than they did before, because with online networking tools, it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily. We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. We don't need a media company to help do this for us.So the traditional media companies, of course, are paying very close attention to these online communities. They know this is the mass audience of the future; they need to figure it out. But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them, because that's how ad rates are still determined. When they're monitoring your clickstream \u2014 and you know they are \u2014 they have a really hard time figuring out your age, your gender and your income. They can make some educated guesses. But they get a lot more information about what you do online, what you like, what interests you. That's easier for them to find out than who you are. And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored. Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. It had been presumed before.So when you look online at the way people aggregate, they don't aggregate around age, gender and income. They aggregate around the things they love, the things that they like, and if you think about it, shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. I'd much rather know whether you like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" rather than how old you are. That would tell me something more substantial about you.Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. If you look at the statistics \u2014 these are worldwide statistics \u2014 in every single age category, women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites, they truly dominate the social media space, which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. The question is: what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture, and what's it going to mean for women? If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media, then does that mean that women are going to take over global media? Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows? Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks? Could this be possible, that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape?Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case. I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women, because they realize this is important for their business, and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. But I think women are actually going to be \u2014 ironically enough \u2014 responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the \"chick flick\" and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things \u2014 that Hispanics like certain things, that young people like certain things. This is far too simplistic. The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action.So you may be asking, well why is it important that I know what entertains people? Why should I know this? Of course, old media companies and advertisers need to know this. But my argument is that, if you want to understand the global village, it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about, what amuses them, what they choose to do in their free time. This is a very important thing to know about people. I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. And I do it not just because it's fun \u2014 though actually, it is really fun \u2014 but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives \u2014 for instance, on their political beliefs and on their health. And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world, looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start.So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. Can you even imagine what that looks like? I can't wait to find out what it looks like.Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 1066, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm going

--> 00:02:21.958\nof consumers.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBut psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nIt's really just been basic demographics.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nSo I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\non demographics\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand how they affect media and entertainment\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nin this country and abroad.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd in the last three years,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nwe've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand we've discovered some very interesting things.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAll the people who participate in social media networks\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nbelong to the same old demographic categories\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat media companies and advertisers\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nhave used in order to understand them.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nBut those categories mean even less now\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthan they did before,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbecause with online networking tools,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nit's much easier for us\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nto escape some of our demographic boxes.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nWe're able to connect with people quite freely\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand to redefine ourselves online.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nWe can also connect with people\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbased on our very specific interests.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nWe don't need a media company\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nto help do this for us.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo the traditional media companies, of course,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nare paying very close attention to these online communities.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nThey know this is the mass audience of the future;\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthey need to figure it out.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nBut they're having a hard time doing it\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nbecause that's how ad rates are still determined.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nWhen they're monitoring your clickstream --\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand you know they are --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthey have a really hard time\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nfiguring out your age, your gender and your income.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThey can make some educated guesses.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nBut they get a lot more information\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nabout what you do online,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhat you like, what interests you.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThat's easier for them to find out than who you are.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd even though that's still sort of creepy,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthere is an upside\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nto having your taste monitored.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSuddenly our taste is being respected\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nin a way that it hasn't been before.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nIt had been presumed before.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo when you look online at the way people aggregate,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthey don't aggregate\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\naround age, gender and income.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey aggregate around the things they love,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthe things that they like,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand if you think about it, shared interests and values\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nare a far more powerful aggregator of human beings\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthan demographic categories.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nI'd much rather know\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwhether you like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nrather than how old you are.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThat would tell me something more substantial about you.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nNow there's something else that we've discovered about social media\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat's actually quite surprising.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt turns out that women\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nare really driving the social media revolution.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nIf you look at the statistics --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthese are worldwide statistics --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nin every single age category,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwomen actually outnumber men\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nin their use of social networking technologies.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd then if you look at the amount of time\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat they spend on these sites,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthey truly dominate the social media space,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwhich is a space that's having a huge impact\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\non old media.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThe question is: what sort of impact\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nis this going to have on our culture,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand what's it going to mean for women?\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nIf the case is that social media\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nis dominating old media\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nand women are dominating social media,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthen does that mean that women\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nare going to take over global media?\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAre we suddenly going to see\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\na lot more female characters in cartoons\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand in games and on TV shows?\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWill the next big-budget blockbuster movies\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nactually be chick flicks?\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nCould this be possible,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat suddenly our media landscape\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nwill become a feminist landscape?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nWell, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nI think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nbecause they realize this is important for their business,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand I think that women\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nare also going to continue to dominate\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthe social media sphere.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nBut I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nresponsible for driving a stake through the heart\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nof cheesy genre categories\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nlike the \"chick flick\"\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand all these other genre categories\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat presume that certain demographic groups\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nlike certain things --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat Hispanics like certain things,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthat young people like certain things.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is far too simplistic.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe future entertainment media that we're going to see\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nis going to be very data-driven,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand it's going to be based on the information\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthat we ascertain from taste communities online,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwhere women are really driving the action.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo you may be asking, well why is it important\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat I know what entertains people?\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWhy should I know this?\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nOf course, old media companies and advertisers\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nneed to know this.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nBut my argument is that,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nif you want to understand the global village,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nit's probably a good idea that you figure out\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwhat they're passionate about, what amuses them,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhat they choose to do in their free time.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThis is a very important thing to know about people.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI've spent most of my professional life\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nresearching media and entertainment\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand its impact on people's lives.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd I do it not just because it's fun --\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nthough actually, it is really fun --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nbut also because\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nour research has shown over and over again\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat entertainment and play\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nhave a huge impact on people's lives --\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nfor instance, on their political beliefs\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand on their health.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nlooking at how people amuse themselves\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nis a really good way to start.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nSo imagine a media atmosphere\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthat isn't dominated by lame stereotypes\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nabout gender\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand other demographic characteristics.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nCan you even imagine what that looks like?\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nI can't wait to find out what it looks like.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nThank you so much.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:17.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Are we born to run?", "duration": "952", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_mcdougall_are_we_born_to_run", "transcript": "Running: it's basically just right, left, right, left, yeah? I mean, we've been doing it for two million years, so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. But the cool thing about running, as I've discovered, is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. Case in point: A couple months ago, if you saw the New York City Marathon, I guarantee you, you saw something that no one has ever seen before.An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line. She's 37 years old. She hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years, and a few months previously, she had almost died in childbirth. Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport, but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event, the New York City Marathon. Except \u2014 bad news for Derartu Tulu \u2014 some other people had the same idea, including the Olympic gold medalist, and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster, the fastest woman marathoner in history by far. Only 10 minutes off the men's world record, Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. That's her competition.The gun goes off, and \u2014 I mean, she's not even an underdog; she's, like, under the underdogs. But the under-underdog hangs tough, and 22 miles into a 26-mile race, there is Derartu Tulu, up there with the lead pack. Now, this is when something really bizarre happens. Paula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands, suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. So we all know what to do in this situation, right? You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. Derartu Tulu ruins the script. Instead of taking off, she falls back and she grabs Paula Radcliffe, and says, \"Come on. Come with us. You can do it.\" So Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it. She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. But then she falls back again. The second time, Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her. And Paula Radcliffe, at that point, says, \"I'm done. Go.\" So that's a fantastic story, and we all know how it ends. She loses the check, but she goes home with something bigger and more important. Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again. Instead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins. Wins the New York City Marathon, goes home with a big fat check.It's a heartwarming story, but if you drill a little bit deeper, you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there. When you have two outliers in one organism, it's not a coincidence. When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race, again, it's not a coincidence. You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills; somehow water's involved.Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there. And the answer to it, I think, can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, where there's a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians. Now, the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. Number one is: they have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years. When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices: you either fight back and engage or you could take off. The Mayans and Aztecs engaged, which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. The Tarahumara had a different strategy. They took off and hid in this labyrinthine, networking, spider-webbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons. And there they've remained since the 1600s, essentially the same way they've always been.The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is: deep into old age \u2014 70 to 80 years old \u2014 these guys aren't running marathons; they're running mega-marathons. They're not doing 26 miles, they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time, and apparently without injury, without problems.The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is: all the things we're going to be talking about today, all the things we're trying to use all of our technology and brain power to solve \u2014 things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer; crime, warfare and violence; clinical depression \u2014 all this stuff \u2014 the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about. They are free from all of these modern ailments.So what's the connection? Again, we're talking about outliers; there's got to be some kind of cause and effect. Well, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains and trying to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. And once again, a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery \u2014 perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries, which go like this: Three things \u2014 if you have the answer, come up and take the microphone, because nobody else knows the answer. If you know it, you're smarter than anybody on planet Earth.Mystery number one is this: Two million years ago, the human brain exploded in size. Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. Suddenly humans show up, Homo erectus, big old melon head. To have a brain of that size, you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy. In other words, early humans are eating dead animals \u2014 no argument, that's a fact. The only problem is, the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago.So somehow, for nearly two million years, we are killing animals without any weapons. Now, we're not using our strength, because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle. Every other animal is stronger than we are, they have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed. We think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel. We're not fast. That would be an Olympic event: turn a squirrel loose, whoever catches it gets a gold medal.(Laughter)So no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws. How were we killing these animals? Mystery number one.Mystery number two: Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now, but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters: they all suck; they're terrible. There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15. I could throw a rock and hit a high-school boy who can run faster than 4:15. For some reason, you guys are just really slow. But \u2014(Laughter)But, you get to the marathon we were just talking about \u2014 you've only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years, because prior to the 1980s, medical science said if a woman tried to run 26 miles \u2014 does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run 26 miles? Why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s?Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.Christopher McDougall: Her uterus would be torn, yes. Torn reproductive organs. The uterus would literally fall out of the body.(Laughter)Now, I've been to a lot of marathons, and I've yet to see any ...(Laughter)So it's only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. In that very short learning curve, you've gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record.Then you go beyond 26 miles, into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans \u2014 remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles \u2014 you get to 50 and 100 miles, and suddenly, it's a different game. You take a runner like Ann Trason or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton, put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world, and it's a coin toss who's going to win. I'll give you an example. A couple years ago, Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock 100, which tells you all you need to know about the race. They give you 48 hours to finish this race. Well, Emily Baer \u2014 500 runners \u2014 she finishes in eighth place, in the top 10, even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race.(Laughter)And yet, she beat 492 other people. The last mystery: Why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer? The third mystery is this: At the University of Utah, they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon. What they found is that if you start running the marathon at age 19, you'll get progressively faster, year by year, until you reach your peak at age 27. And then after that, you succumb to the rigors of time. And you'll get slower and slower, until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19. So about seven, eight years to reach your peak, and then gradually you fall off your peak, until you go back to the starting point. You'd think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed, maybe 10 years \u2014 no, it's 45 years. 64-year-old men and women are running as fast as they were at age 19. Now, I defy you to come up with any other physical activity \u2014 and please don't say golf \u2014 something that's actually hard \u2014(Laughter)where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers.So you have these three mysteries. Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up? You've got to be careful anytime someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you a global answer because, it being prehistory, you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it. But I'll submit this to you: If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle, suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture. If you're wondering why the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease, why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive, and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons, perhaps it's because humans, as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe, actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs.Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness \u2014 again, it's not our fangs, our claws or our speed \u2014 the only thing we do really well is sweat. We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. Better than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well. But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances, we're superb \u2014 the best on the planet. You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice: it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off. But it ain't doing both. We can. So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals? What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group, go out there on that African savanna, pick out an antelope, go out as a pack, and run that thing to death? That's all we could do. We could run really far on a hot day.Well, if that's true, a couple other things had to be true as well. The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word \"pack.\" If you go out by yourself and try to chase an antelope, I guarantee there will be two cadavers out in the savanna. You need a pack to pull together. You need to have those 64- and 65-year-olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're trying to catch. The herd explodes and it gathers back again. Those expert trackers have to be part of the pack. They can't be 10 miles behind. You need the women and the adolescents there, because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you're a nursing mother and a developing adolescent. It makes no sense to have the antelope over there, dead, and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away. They need to be part of the pack. You need those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill, and you need those teenagers who are learning the whole thing involved. The pack stays together.Another thing that has to be true: this pack cannot be materialistic. You can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope. You can't be a pissed-off pack. You can't be bearing grudges, like, \"I'm not chasing that guy's antelope. He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope.\" The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego, be cooperative, and pull together. What you end up with, in other words, is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara, a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years, that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path.You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing, this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. But maybe it's something different. Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it. How do we spoil it? Well, how do we spoil anything? We try to cash in on it. Right? We try to can it and package it and make it \"better\" and then sell it to people. And then what happened was, we started creating these fancy cushioned things which can make running \"better,\" called running shoes.The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. And I think if anybody in here runs \u2014 I just had a conversation with Carol. We talked for two minutes backstage, and she talked about plantar fasciitis. You talk to a runner, I guarantee within 30 seconds, the conversation turns to injury. So if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage, then why are we so bad at it? Why do we keep getting hurt?A curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time. If you read folklore and mythology, any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales, running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. Geronimo used to say, \"My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs.\" That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert, engage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses, and slap leather for home. Geronimo was never saying, \"You know something, my Achilles \u2014 I'm tapering. I've got to take this week off.\" Or, \"I need to cross-train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready.\"(Laughter)Humans ran and ran all the time. We are here today. We have our digital technology. All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day, which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances.So how do we get back to that again? Well, I would submit to you the first thing is: get rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing. Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. Stop focusing on urban marathons, which, if you do four hours, you suck, and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome, because you qualified for another race. We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and, I would say, nakedness, that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. So what's the benefit? So what? So you burn off the H\u00e4agen-Dazs from the night before.But maybe there's another benefit there as well. Without getting too extreme about this, imagine a world where everybody could go out the door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed, more serene, more healthy, burn off stress \u2014 where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore, or go home with a lot of stress on top of you again. Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been. I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet, but maybe there's somewhere in between. And if we find that thing, maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence up until the 1970s or so, the benefits \u2014 social and physical and political and mental \u2014 could be astounding.What I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners, people who've gotten rid of their shoes. And what they have found uniformly is, you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress, you get rid of the injuries and the ailments. And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time: that this can be a whole lot of fun. I've experienced it personally myself. I was injured all my life; then in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away, too.So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. I appreciate your listening to this story.Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id": 1067, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.529\nRunning: it's basically just\nright, left, right, left, yeah?\n\n00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:17.982\nI mean, we've been doing it\nfor two million years,\n\n00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.552\nso it's kind of arrogant to assume\nthat I've got something to say\n\n00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:24.796\nthat hasn't been said and performed\nbetter a long time ago.\n\n00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.750\nBut the cool thing about running,\nas I've discovered,\n\n00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:31.359\nis that something bizarre happens\nin this activity all the time.\n\n00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:34.958\nCase in point: A couple months ago,\nif you saw the New York City Marathon,\n\n00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:38.570\nI guarantee you, you saw something\nthat no one has ever seen before.\n\n00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:43.022\nAn Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu\nturns up at the starting line.\n\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.072\nShe's 37 years old.\n\n00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:47.782\nShe hasn't won a marathon\nof any kind in eight years,\n\n00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:49.234\nand a few months previously,\n\n00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.234\nshe had almost died in childbirth.\n\n00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:54.749\nDerartu Tulu was ready to hang it up\nand retire from the sport,\n\n00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:56.645\nbut she decided she'd go for broke\n\n00:00:56.669 --> 00:01:00.457\nand try for one last big payday\nin the marquee event,\n\n00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:02.096\nthe New York City Marathon.\n\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.834\nExcept -- bad news for Derartu Tulu --\nsome other people had the same idea,\n\n00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:07.712\nincluding the Olympic gold medalist,\n\n00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:10.834\nand Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,\n\n00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:14.430\nthe fastest woman marathoner\nin history by far.\n\n00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:16.731\nOnly 10 minutes\noff the men's world record,\n\n00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:19.659\nPaula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.\n\n00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.834\nThat's her competition.\n\n00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:24.806\nThe gun goes off, and -- I mean,\nshe's not even an underdog;\n\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.645\nshe's, like, under the underdogs.\n\n00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.714\nBut the under-underdog hangs tough,\n\n00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:31.549\nand 22 miles into a 26-mile race,\n\n00:01:31.573 --> 00:01:34.469\nthere is Derartu Tulu,\nup there with the lead pack.\n\n00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.953\nNow, this is when something\nreally bizarre happens.\n\n00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:41.739\nPaula Radcliffe, the one person\nwho is sure to snatch the big paycheck\n\n00:01:41.763 --> 00:01:44.834\nfrom Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,\n\n00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:47.255\nsuddenly grabs her leg\nand starts to fall back.\n\n00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.690\nSo we all know what to do\nin this situation, right?\n\n00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:52.400\nYou give her a quick crack\nin the teeth with your elbow\n\n00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:53.923\nand blaze for the finish line.\n\n00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.437\nDerartu Tulu ruins the script.\n\n00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:57.910\nInstead of taking off,\n\n00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.183\nshe falls back and she grabs\nPaula Radcliffe,\n\n00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:02.545\nand says, \"Come on.\nCome with us. You can do it.\"\n\n00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.980\nSo Paula Radcliffe,\nunfortunately, does it.\n\n00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.617\nShe catches up with the lead pack\n\n00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:08.504\nand is pushing toward the finish line.\n\n00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.047\nBut then she falls back again.\n\n00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:13.063\nThe second time, Derartu Tulu\ngrabs her and tries to pull her.\n\n00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:15.925\nAnd Paula Radcliffe, at that point,\nsays, \"I'm done. Go.\"\n\n00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.225\nSo that's a fantastic story,\nand we all know how it ends.\n\n00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.539\nShe loses the check,\n\n00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:23.488\nbut she goes home with something\nbigger and more important.\n\n00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:26.008\nExcept Derartu Tulu\nruins the script again.\n\n00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:29.532\nInstead of losing, she blazes\npast the lead pack and wins.\n\n00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:31.218\nWins the New York City Marathon,\n\n00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:32.876\ngoes home with a big fat check.\n\n00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.171\nIt's a heartwarming story,\n\n00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:37.172\nbut if you drill a little bit deeper,\n\n00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:40.604\nyou've got to sort of wonder\nabout what exactly was going on there.\n\n00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.763\nWhen you have two outliers\nin one organism,\n\n00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.161\nit's not a coincidence.\n\n00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:47.676\nWhen you have someone who is more\ncompetitive and more compassionate\n\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.677\nthan anybody else in the race,\nagain, it's not a coincidence.\n\n00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:53.144\nYou show me a creature\nwith webbed feet and gills;\n\n00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:54.816\nsomehow water's involved.\n\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.222\nSomeone with that kind of heart,\nthere's some kind of connection there.\n\n00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:00.813\nAnd the answer to it,\nI think, can be found\n\n00:03:00.837 --> 00:03:03.246\ndown in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,\n\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.147\nwhere there's a reclusive tribe,\ncalled the Tarahumara Indians.\n\n00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:10.730\nNow, the Tarahumara\nare remarkable for three things.\n\n00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:12.229\nNumber one is:\n\n00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:16.459\nthey have been living essentially\nunchanged for the past 400 years.\n\n00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:20.097\nWhen the conquistadors arrived\nin North America you had two choices:\n\n00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:22.834\nyou either fight back and engage\nor you could take off.\n\n00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:24.716\nThe Mayans and Aztecs engaged,\n\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.186\nwhich is why there are very few\nMayans and Aztecs.\n\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.195\nThe Tarahumara had a different strategy.\n\n00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.083\nThey took off and hid\n\n00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:35.962\nin this labyrinthine, networking,\nspider-webbing system of canyons\n\n00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:37.387\ncalled the Copper Canyons.\n\n00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:40.834\nAnd there they've remained\nsince the 1600s,\n\n00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:43.461\nessentially the same way\nthey've always been.\n\n00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.436\nThe second thing remarkable\nabout the Tarahumara is:\n\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.588\ndeep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --\n\n00:03:50.612 --> 00:03:52.589\nthese guys aren't running marathons;\n\n00:03:52.613 --> 00:03:54.460\nthey're running mega-marathons.\n\n00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.129\nThey're not doing 26 miles,\n\n00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.775\nthey're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,\n\n00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.268\nand apparently without injury,\nwithout problems.\n\n00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:04.630\nThe last thing that's remarkable\nabout the Tarahumara is:\n\n00:04:04.654 --> 00:04:07.171\nall the things we're going\nto be talking about today,\n\n00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.000\nall the things we're trying to use\nall of our technology\n\n00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:11.362\nand brain power to solve --\n\n00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:13.936\nthings like heart disease\nand cholesterol and cancer;\n\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.558\ncrime, warfare and violence;\nclinical depression -- all this stuff --\n\n00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:20.054\nthe Tarahumara don't know\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:23.834\nThey are free from all\nof these modern ailments.\n\n00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:25.915\nSo what's the connection?\n\n00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.677\nAgain, we're talking about outliers;\n\n00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.992\nthere's got to be some kind\nof cause and effect.\n\n00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:33.834\nWell, there are teams of scientists\nat Harvard and the University of Utah\n\n00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:36.438\nthat are bending their brains\nand trying to figure out\n\n00:04:36.462 --> 00:04:38.405\nwhat the Tarahumara have known forever.\n\n00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:41.093\nThey're trying to solve\nthose same kinds of mysteries.\n\n00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:44.540\nAnd once again, a mystery\nwrapped inside of a mystery --\n\n00:04:44.564 --> 00:04:47.683\nperhaps the key to Derartu Tulu\nand the Tarahumara\n\n00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:50.344\nis wrapped in three other\nmysteries, which go like this:\n\n00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:53.777\nThree things -- if you have the answer,\ncome up and take the microphone,\n\n00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:55.630\nbecause nobody else knows the answer.\n\n00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:58.539\nIf you know it, you're smarter\nthan anybody on planet Earth.\n\n00:04:58.563 --> 00:04:59.986\nMystery number one is this:\n\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.764\nTwo million years ago,\nthe human brain exploded in size.\n\n00:05:02.788 --> 00:05:04.899\nAustralopithecus\nhad a tiny little pea brain.\n\n00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:07.969\nSuddenly humans show up,\nHomo erectus, big old melon head.\n\n00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:09.516\nTo have a brain of that size,\n\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.143\nyou need to have a source\nof condensed caloric energy.\n\n00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:15.788\nIn other words, early humans\nare eating dead animals --\n\n00:05:15.812 --> 00:05:17.144\nno argument, that's a fact.\n\n00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:19.075\nThe only problem is,\n\n00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.689\nthe first edged weapons only appeared\nabout 200,000 years ago.\n\n00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:25.408\nSo somehow, for nearly two million years,\n\n00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:28.103\nwe are killing animals\nwithout any weapons.\n\n00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.827\nNow, we're not using our strength,\n\n00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:32.209\nbecause we are the biggest\nsissies in the jungle.\n\n00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:34.275\nEvery other animal\nis stronger than we are,\n\n00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:37.729\nthey have fangs, they have claws,\nthey have nimbleness, they have speed.\n\n00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.124\nWe think Usain Bolt is fast.\n\n00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:41.492\nUsain Bolt can get\nhis ass kicked by a squirrel.\n\n00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:42.667\nWe're not fast.\n\n00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:44.182\nThat would be an Olympic event:\n\n00:05:44.206 --> 00:05:47.043\nturn a squirrel loose,\nwhoever catches it gets a gold medal.\n\n00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:48.082\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:48.106 --> 00:05:50.824\nSo no weapons, no speed,\nno strength, no fangs, no claws.\n\n00:05:50.848 --> 00:05:53.490\nHow were we killing these animals?\nMystery number one.\n\n00:05:53.514 --> 00:05:54.955\nMystery number two:\n\n00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.032\nWomen have been in the Olympics\nfor quite some time now,\n\n00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:00.864\nbut one thing that's remarkable\nabout all women sprinters:\n\n00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:02.643\nthey all suck; they're terrible.\n\n00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:06.395\nThere's not a fast woman on the planet\nand there never has been.\n\n00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.396\nThe fastest woman\nto ever run a mile did it in 4:15.\n\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.638\nI could throw a rock\nand hit a high-school boy\n\n00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.158\nwho can run faster than 4:15.\n\n00:06:13.182 --> 00:06:15.373\nFor some reason,\nyou guys are just really slow.\n\n00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:16.555\nBut --\n\n00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:17.638\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:20.408\nBut, you get to the marathon\nwe were just talking about --\n\n00:06:20.432 --> 00:06:23.210\nyou've only been allowed to run\nthe marathon for 20 years,\n\n00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:25.505\nbecause prior to the 1980s,\nmedical science said\n\n00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.893\nif a woman tried to run 26 miles --\ndoes anyone know what would happen\n\n00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:30.350\nif you tried to run 26 miles?\n\n00:06:30.374 --> 00:06:32.990\nWhy you were banned\nfrom the marathon before the 1980s?\n\n00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:35.100\nAudience Member: Her uterus would be torn.\n\n00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:37.652\nChristopher McDougall:\nHer uterus would be torn, yes.\n\n00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:38.916\nTorn reproductive organs.\n\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.199\nThe uterus would literally\nfall out of the body.\n\n00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:42.244\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.087\nNow, I've been to a lot of marathons,\n\n00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:45.752\nand I've yet to see any ...\n\n00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:48.685\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.076\nSo it's only been 20 years\n\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.479\nthat women have been allowed\nto run the marathon.\n\n00:06:52.503 --> 00:06:56.524\nIn that very short learning curve,\nyou've gone from broken organs\n\n00:06:56.548 --> 00:07:00.349\nup to the fact that you're only 10 minutes\noff the male world record.\n\n00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:02.678\nThen you go beyond 26 miles,\ninto the distance\n\n00:07:02.702 --> 00:07:05.635\nthat medical science also told us\nwould be fatal to humans --\n\n00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.025\nremember Pheidippides died\nwhen he ran 26 miles --\n\n00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:11.317\nyou get to 50 and 100 miles,\nand suddenly, it's a different game.\n\n00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:14.584\nYou take a runner like Ann Trason\nor Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,\n\n00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:18.035\nput them in a race of 50 or 100 miles\nagainst anybody in the world,\n\n00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.036\nand it's a coin toss who's going to win.\n\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.406\nI'll give you an example.\n\n00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.945\nA couple years ago,\nEmily Baer signed up for a race\n\n00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:25.659\ncalled the Hardrock 100,\n\n00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:28.245\nwhich tells you all you need\nto know about the race.\n\n00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.308\nThey give you 48 hours\nto finish this race.\n\n00:07:30.332 --> 00:07:32.237\nWell, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --\n\n00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:34.608\nshe finishes in eighth place,\nin the top 10,\n\n00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:36.886\neven though she stopped\nat all the aid stations\n\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.805\nto breastfeed her baby during the race.\n\n00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:39.843\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:41.565\nAnd yet, she beat 492 other people.\n\n00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:43.246\nThe last mystery:\n\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.054\nWhy is it that women get stronger\nas distances get longer?\n\n00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:47.414\nThe third mystery is this:\n\n00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:50.906\nAt the University of Utah,\nthey started tracking finishing times\n\n00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.590\nfor people running the marathon.\n\n00:07:52.614 --> 00:07:56.421\nWhat they found is that if you start\nrunning the marathon at age 19,\n\n00:07:56.445 --> 00:07:58.698\nyou'll get progressively\nfaster, year by year,\n\n00:07:58.722 --> 00:08:00.699\nuntil you reach your peak at age 27.\n\n00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:04.699\nAnd then after that,\nyou succumb to the rigors of time.\n\n00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:06.315\nAnd you'll get slower and slower,\n\n00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:09.928\nuntil eventually you're back to running\nthe same speed you were at age 19.\n\n00:08:09.952 --> 00:08:12.193\nSo about seven, eight years\nto reach your peak,\n\n00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:14.293\nand then gradually you fall off your peak,\n\n00:08:14.317 --> 00:08:16.595\nuntil you go back to the starting point.\n\n00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:19.839\nYou'd think it might take eight years\nto go back to the same speed,\n\n00:08:19.863 --> 00:08:22.595\nmaybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.\n\n00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:24.596\n64-year-old men and women\n\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.659\nare running as fast\nas they were at age 19.\n\n00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:30.671\nNow, I defy you to come\nup with any other physical activity --\n\n00:08:30.695 --> 00:08:33.657\nand please don't say golf --\nsomething that's actually hard --\n\n00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:34.729\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:34.753 --> 00:08:39.300\nwhere geriatrics are performing\nas well as they did as teenagers.\n\n00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:41.124\nSo you have these three mysteries.\n\n00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:45.596\nIs there one piece in the puzzle\nwhich might wrap all these things up?\n\n00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:48.987\nYou've got to be careful anytime\nsomeone looks back in prehistory\n\n00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.317\nand tries to give you\na global answer because,\n\n00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:54.128\nit being prehistory, you can say\nwhatever the hell you want\n\n00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:55.311\nand get away with it.\n\n00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:56.701\nBut I'll submit this to you:\n\n00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:59.426\nIf you put one piece in the middle\nof this jigsaw puzzle,\n\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.828\nsuddenly it all starts\nto form a coherent picture.\n\n00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:04.240\nIf you're wondering\nwhy the Tarahumara don't fight\n\n00:09:04.264 --> 00:09:05.788\nand don't die of heart disease,\n\n00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:08.572\nwhy a poor Ethiopian\nwoman named Derartu Tulu\n\n00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:11.425\ncan be the most compassionate\nand yet the most competitive,\n\n00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:15.272\nand why we somehow were able\nto find food without weapons,\n\n00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:17.273\nperhaps it's because humans,\n\n00:09:17.297 --> 00:09:20.519\nas much as we like to think of ourselves\nas masters of the universe,\n\n00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:23.961\nactually evolved as nothing more\nthan a pack of hunting dogs.\n\n00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:27.820\nMaybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.\n\n00:09:28.191 --> 00:09:30.767\nBecause the one advantage\nwe have in the wilderness --\n\n00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:33.247\nagain, it's not our fangs,\nour claws or our speed --\n\n00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.596\nthe only thing we do really well is sweat.\n\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.398\nWe're really good\nat being sweaty and smelly.\n\n00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:41.660\nBetter than any other mammal\non Earth, we can sweat really well.\n\n00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:45.548\nBut the advantage of that little bit\nof social discomfort\n\n00:09:45.572 --> 00:09:50.679\nis the fact that, when it comes to running\nunder hot heat for long distances,\n\n00:09:50.703 --> 00:09:52.947\nwe're superb -- the best on the planet.\n\n00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:55.056\nYou take a horse on a hot day,\n\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.968\nand after about five or six miles,\nthat horse has a choice:\n\n00:09:57.992 --> 00:10:00.645\nit's either going to breathe\nor it's going to cool off.\n\n00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:02.247\nBut it ain't doing both.

Right?\n\n00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:10.684\nWe try to can it and package it\nand make it \"better\"\n\n00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:12.097\nand then sell it to people.\n\n00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:14.615\nAnd then what happened was,\nwe started creating\n\n00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:18.073\nthese fancy cushioned things\nwhich can make running \"better,\"\n\n00:12:18.097 --> 00:12:19.513\ncalled running shoes.\n\n00:12:19.537 --> 00:12:22.469\nThe reason I get personally\npissed-off about running shoes\n\n00:12:22.493 --> 00:12:25.470\nis because I bought a million of them\nand I kept getting hurt.\n\n00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.471\nAnd I think if anybody in here runs --\n\n00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:29.275\nI just had a conversation with Carol.\n\n00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:32.930\nWe talked for two minutes backstage,\nand she talked about plantar fasciitis.\n\n00:12:32.954 --> 00:12:35.505\nYou talk to a runner,\nI guarantee within 30 seconds,\n\n00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:37.158\nthe conversation turns to injury.\n\n00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:40.469\nSo if humans evolved as runners,\nif that's our one natural advantage,\n\n00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:41.966\nthen why are we so bad at it?\n\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.601\nWhy do we keep getting hurt?\n\n00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.997\nA curious thing about running\nand running injuries\n\n00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:48.509\nis that the running injury\nis new to our time.\n\n00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:50.357\nIf you read folklore and mythology,\n\n00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:52.382\nany kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,\n\n00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:56.014\nrunning is always associated\nwith freedom and vitality\n\n00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:57.834\nand youthfulness and eternal vigor.\n\n00:12:57.858 --> 00:13:00.752\nIt's only in our lifetime\nthat running has become associated\n\n00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:01.931\nwith fear and pain.\n\n00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:06.066\nGeronimo used to say, \"My only friends\nare my legs. I only trust my legs.\"\n\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.709\nThat's because an Apache triathlon\nused to be you'd run 50 miles\n\n00:13:09.733 --> 00:13:10.884\nacross the desert,\n\n00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:13.520\nengage in hand-to-hand combat,\nsteal a bunch of horses,\n\n00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:14.874\nand slap leather for home.\n\n00:13:14.898 --> 00:13:18.623\nGeronimo was never saying, \"You know\nsomething, my Achilles -- I'm tapering.\n\n00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:20.207\nI've got to take this week off.\"\n\n00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.248\nOr, \"I need to cross-train.\nI didn't do yoga.

So what?\n\n00:14:09.727 --> 00:14:12.596\nSo you burn off the H\u00e4agen-Dazs\nfrom the night before.\n\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.042\nBut maybe there's another\nbenefit there as well.\n\n00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:18.199\nWithout getting too extreme about this,\n\n00:14:18.223 --> 00:14:22.834\nimagine a world where everybody\ncould go out the door\n\n00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:24.834\nand engage in the kind of exercise\n\n00:14:24.858 --> 00:14:27.834\nthat's going to make them\nmore relaxed, more serene,\n\n00:14:27.858 --> 00:14:29.163\nmore healthy,\n\n00:14:29.187 --> 00:14:30.499\nburn off stress --\n\n00:14:30.523 --> 00:14:33.712\nwhere you don't come back into your office\na raging maniac anymore,\n\n00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:36.220\nor go home with a lot of stress\non top of you again.\n\n00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:38.575\nMaybe there's something\nbetween what we are today\n\n00:14:38.599 --> 00:14:41.107\nand what the Tarahumara have always been.\n\n00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.360\nI don't say let's go back\nto the Copper Canyons\n\n00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:46.769\nand live on corn and maize,\nwhich is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,\n\n00:14:46.793 --> 00:14:48.873\nbut maybe there's somewhere in between.\n\n00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:50.564\nAnd if we find that thing,\n\n00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:53.168\nmaybe there is a big fat\nNobel Prize out there.\n\n00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:58.079\nBecause if somebody could find a way\nto restore that natural ability\n\n00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:00.275\nthat we all enjoyed\nfor most of our existence\n\n00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.870\nup until the 1970s or so,\n\n00:15:01.894 --> 00:15:07.285\nthe benefits -- social and physical\nand political and mental --\n\n00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:08.582\ncould be astounding.\n\n00:15:08.606 --> 00:15:12.675\nWhat I've been seeing today\nis there is a growing subculture\n\n00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:15.618\nof barefoot runners,\npeople who've gotten rid of their shoes.\n\n00:15:15.642 --> 00:15:17.528\nAnd what they have found uniformly is,\n\n00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:20.079\nyou get rid of the shoes,\nyou get rid of the stress,\n\n00:15:20.103 --> 00:15:22.571\nyou get rid of the injuries\nand the ailments.\n\n00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:25.385\nAnd what you find is something\nthe Tarahumara have known\n\n00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:26.574\nfor a very long time:\n\n00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:28.360\nthat this can be a whole lot of fun.\n\n00:15:28.384 --> 00:15:30.211\nI've experienced it personally myself.\n\n00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:33.591\nI was injured all my life; then\nin my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes\n\n00:15:33.615 --> 00:15:35.834\nand my running ailments\nhave gone away, too.\n\n00:15:35.858 --> 00:15:38.416\nSo hopefully it's something\nwe can all benefit from.\n\n00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.482\nI appreciate your listening to this story.\n\n00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:41.657\nThanks very much.\n\n00:15:41.681 --> 00:15:43.672\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Poems of war, peace, women, power", "duration": "353", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/suheir_hammad_poems_of_war_peace_women_power", "transcript": "\"What I Will\"I will not dance to your war drum. I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum. I will not dance to that beating. I know that beat. It is lifeless. I know intimately that skin you are hitting. It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched. I will not dance to your drummed-up war. I will not pop, spin, break for you. I will not hate for you or even hate you. I will not kill for you. Especially I will not die for you. I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. Everyone can be wrong.

I understand.I've been wrong a lot lately. Like a lot. So I couldn't figure out what to read today. I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping. What that means is prepping my outfit, (Laughter) prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. Poetry does that. It preps you. It aims you.So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. Hold her now with you. You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her. Are you holding her?This is \"Break Clustered.\"All holy history banned. Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past. But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence. Whose son shall it be? Which male child will perish a new day? Our boys' deaths galvanize. We cherish corpses. We mourn women, complicated. Bitches get beat daily. Profits made, prophets ignored. War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods. All colors run, none of us solid. Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. I live cycles of light and darkness. Rhythm is half silence. I see now, I never was one and not the other. Sickness, health, tender violence. I think now I never was pure. Before form I was storm, blind, ign'ant \u2014 still am. Human contracted itself blind, malignant. I never was pure. Girl spoiled before ripened. Language can't math me. I experience exponentially. Everything is everything. One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family. One woman loses six. One woman loses her head. One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. One woman straps herself. One woman gives birth to a baby. One woman gives birth to borders. One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. One woman never did. Where do refugee hearts go? Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed. Faced with absence. We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. My spine curves spiral. Precipice running to and running from human beings. Cluster bombs left behind. De facto landmines. A smoldering grief. Harvest contaminated tobacco. Harvest bombs. Harvest baby teeth. Harvest palms, smoke. Harvest witness, smoke. Resolutions, smoke. Salvation, smoke. Redemption, smoke. Breathe.

I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings, and take stock of your miserable existence. (Laughter)Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40. Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior \u2014 I was eating too much, I was drinking too much, I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family. And I decided that I would try and turn my life around. In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance. So I stepped back from the workforce, and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work. (Laughter) Not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out.So I went back to work, and I've spent these seven years since struggling with, studying and writing about work-life balance. And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today. The first is: if society's to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate. But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance. All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue, which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family. Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. (Laughter) (Applause) It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.(Laughter)The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us. We should stop looking outside. It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you, and you may just not like their idea of balance. It's particularly important \u2014 this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired \u2014 it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies \u2014 the \"abattoirs of the human soul,\" as I call them. (Laughter) I'm talking about all companies. Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [as] they can get away with. It's in their nature; it's in their DNA; it's what they do \u2014 even the good, well-intentioned companies. On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. On the other hand, it's a nightmare \u2014 it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life.The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. Before I went back to work after my year at home, I sat down and I wrote out a detailed, step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to. And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have breakfast with my wife and children. Have sex again. (Laughter) Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. Do three hours' work. Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. Do another three hours' work. Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink. Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. Meditate for half an hour. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have sex again. Go to bed. (Applause) How often do you think I have that day? (Laughter) We need to be realistic. You can't do it all in one day. We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the \"I'll have a life when I retire, when my kids have left home, when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left.\" (Laughter) A day is too short; \"after I retire\" is too long. There's got to be a middle way.A fourth observation: We need to approach balance in a balanced way. A friend came to see me last year \u2014 and she doesn't mind me telling this story \u2014 a friend came to see me last year and said, \"Nigel, I've read your book. And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. It's totally dominated by work. I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day. All of my relationships have failed. There's nothing in my life apart from my work. So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out. So I joined a gym.\" (Laughter) Now I don't mean to mock, but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn't more balanced; it's more fit. (Laughter) Lovely though physical exercise may be, there are other parts to life \u2014 there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side; there's the spiritual side. And to be balanced, I believe we have to attend to all of those areas \u2014 not just do 50 stomach crunches.Now that can be daunting. Because people say, \"Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit. You want me to go to church and call my mother.\" And I understand. I truly understand how that can be daunting. But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective. My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office and said, \"Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son\" \u2014 Harry \u2014 \"up from school.\" Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games. I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe, and we shared a pizza for two, then walked down the hill to our home, and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas. I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's \"James and the Giant Peach.\" I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, \"Goodnight, mate,\" and walked out of his bedroom. As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, \"Dad?\" I went, \"Yes, mate?\" He went, \"Dad, this has been the best day of my life, ever.\" I hadn't done anything, hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.Now my point is the small things matter. Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life. With the smallest investment in the right places, you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. Moreover, I think, it can transform society. Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading.(Applause)", "id": 1069, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nWhat I thought I would

And as a little girl, I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick \u2014 something that would delight us, enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that didn't really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them.So 20 years pass \u2014 I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. But robots are still not in our home, ironically. And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. But one really struck me. Robotics had really been about interacting with things, not with people \u2014 certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet. And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet, the world's first social robot. Three years later \u2014 a lot of programming, working with other graduate students in the lab \u2014 Kismet was ready to start interacting with people.(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.Kismet: (Nonsense)Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week.Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child, which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter. This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us \u2014 and with that, the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots.So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots, now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object. And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction.(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo. Leo, this is Cookie Monster. Can you find Cookie Monster? Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad. He's very bad, Leo. Cookie Monster is very, very bad. He's a scary monster. He wants to get your cookies.(Laughter)CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start, but they get along great now.So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology, where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine new questions, new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. But what do I mean when I say \"push our social buttons?\" Well, one of the things that we've learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use \u2014 like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here \u2014 what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is, how likable, how engaging, how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots.It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter, we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is? Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how? Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters? It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot, you can.And so in this video here \u2014 this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. And the bottom line is \u2014 the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. So given that key insight, we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues, maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology. So imagine this: What about a robot accessory for your cellphone? You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot \u2014 you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture \u2014 maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task \u2014 this ended up being a survival task \u2014 and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. The first was just the screen. This is just like video conferencing today. The next was to add mobility \u2014 so, have the screen on a mobile base. This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today \u2014 this is mirroring that situation. And then the fully expressive MeBot.So after the interaction, we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology, with a remote collaborator through this technology, in a number of different ways. We looked at psychological involvement \u2014 how much empathy did you feel for the other person? We looked at overall engagement. We looked at their desire to cooperate. And this is what we see when they use just the screen. It turns out, when you add mobility \u2014 the ability to roll around the table \u2014 you get a little more of a boost. And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. So it seems like this physical, social embodiment actually really makes a difference.Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. For me, I have three young boys, and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. But my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often. We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little \u2014 they don't really want to talk; they want to play. So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology. I imagine a time not too far from now \u2014 my mom can go to her computer, open up a browser and jack into a little robot. And as grandma-bot, she can now play, really play, with my sons, with her grandsons, in the real world with his real toys. I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters, with their friends, and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house, like sharing a bedtime story. And through this technology, being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today.Let's think about some other domains, like maybe health. So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well. And we know that as you get older in life, if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life, but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight. Sort of like a digital Jiminy \u2014 as in the well-known fairy tale \u2014 a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. So we actually explored this idea in our lab.This is a robot, Autom. Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach. It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do. It could make eye contact with you. It could share information looking down at a screen. You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got. And then it could help track that for you. And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. It could help you set goals and track your progress, and it would help motivate you.So an interesting question is, does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot? Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters? To explore that question, we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. One case was the robot you saw there, Autom. Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface, ran exactly the same dialogues. The quality of advice was identical. And the third was just a pen and paper log, because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program.So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost, but really how long they interacted with the robot. Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off. And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions, well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success. So the first thing I want to look at is how long, how long did people interact with these systems. It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more, even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance, people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. (Laughter) And when you look at emotional engagement, it was completely different. People would name the robots. They would dress the robots. (Laughter) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study, they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots. They didn't do this with a computer.The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today, whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen. But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play, like, real-world play. And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child, where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play. So here's the first exploration of this idea, where characters can be physical or virtual, and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play.But we can push this idea further. What if \u2014 (Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay! CB: \u2014 the character itself could come into your world? It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2. You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. So they are now sending the character back into that world. And now it's got number power.And then finally, what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids, where they really feel like they are part of that story, a part of that experience. And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching \"Star Wars.\" But I want to do more than that. I actually want them to create those experiences. I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. I think that's very, very important.So this is a new project. We've invited a lot of kids into this space, and they think it's pretty cool. But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most is the robot. What they care about is the robot. Robots touch something deeply human within us. And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative, or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance, or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves, for me, robots are all about people.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1070, "subtitle":

00:02:04.958\nI've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nnow at the media lab\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwith my own team of

bit of a rough start,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut they get along great now.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSo what I've learned\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthrough building these systems\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nis that robots are actually\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\na really intriguing social technology,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwhere it's actually their ability\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nto push our social buttons\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand to interact with us like a partner\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat is a core

robots\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthat we might not have thought about otherwise.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nBut what do I mean when I say \"push our social buttons?\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWell, one of the things that we've learned\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis that, if we design these robots to communicate with us\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nusing the same body language,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthe same sort of non-verbal cues that people use --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nlike Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here --\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nwhat we find is that people respond to robots\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\na lot like they respond to people.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nPeople use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nhow likable, how engaging,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nhow trustworthy.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nIt turns out it's the same for robots.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIt's turning out now\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthat robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nto understand human behavior.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nTo answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwe're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nMimicry's believed to play a role, but how?\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nIs it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIt turns out it's really hard\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nto learn this or understand this from watching people\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nbecause when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nBut with the robot, you can.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd so in this video here --\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthis is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nHe's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThere's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nto be able to study this question.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nbecause it turns out people just behave like people\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\neven when interacting with a robot.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo given that key insight,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwe can now start to imagine\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nnew kinds of applications for robots.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nFor instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nmaybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo imagine this:\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nWhat about a robot accessory for your cellphone?\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nYou call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nand, bam! You're a MeBot --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nyou can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nyou can move around, you can gesture --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nmaybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nTo explore this question,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nmy student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwhere we brought human participants, people, into our lab\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nto do a collaborative task\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nwith a remote collaborator.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThe task involved things\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nlike looking at a set of objects on the table,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\ndiscussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthis ended up being a survival task --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then rating them in terms\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nof how valuable and important they thought they were.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThe remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nwho used one of three different technologies\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nto interact with the participants.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThe first was just the screen.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThis is just like video conferencing today.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThe next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nThis is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthis is mirroring that situation.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd then the fully expressive MeBot.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo after the interaction,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe asked people to rate their quality of interaction\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwith the technology, with a remote collaborator\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthrough this technology, in a number of different ways.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nWe looked at psychological involvement --\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nhow much empathy did you feel for the other person?\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWe looked at overall engagement.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWe looked at their desire to cooperate.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd this is what we see when they use just the screen.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nIt turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table --\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nyou get a little more of a boost.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo it seems like this physical, social embodiment\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nactually really makes a difference.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nNow let's try to put this into a little bit of context.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nToday we know that families are living further and further apart,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand that definitely takes a toll on family relationships\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand family bonds over distance.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nFor me, I have three young boys,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand I want them to have a really good relationship\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwith their grandparents.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut my parents live thousands of miles away,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nso they just don't get to see each other that often.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWe try Skype, we try phone calls,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nbut my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk;\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthey want to play.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo I love the idea of thinking about robots\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nas a new kind of distance-play technology.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nI imagine a time not too far from now --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nmy mom can go to her computer,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nopen up a browser and jack into a little robot.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd as grandma-bot,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nshe can now play, really play,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwith my sons, with her grandsons,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nin the real world with his real toys.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nI could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwith their granddaughters, with their friends,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nlike sharing a bedtime story.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd through this technology,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nbeing able to be an active participant\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nin their grandchildren's lives\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin a way that's not possible today.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nLet's think about some other domains,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nlike maybe health.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nSo in the United States today,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nover 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand now it's a big problem with our children as well.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd we know that as you get older in life,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nif you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat not only reduce your quality of life,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nbut are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBut if robots can be engaging,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nif we like to cooperate with robots,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nif robots are persuasive,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nmaybe a robot can help you\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nmaintain a diet and exercise program,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nmaybe they can help you manage your weight.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSort of like a digital Jiminy --\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nas in the well-known fairy tale --\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\na kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nto be able to help you make the right decision\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nin the right way at the right time\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nto help you form healthy habits.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSo we actually explored this idea in our lab.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThis is a robot, Autom.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nCory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIt had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIt could make eye contact with you.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nIt could share information looking down at a screen.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nYou'd use a screen interface to enter information,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nlike how many calories you ate that day,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nhow much exercise you got.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd then it could help track that for you.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd the robot spoke with a synthetic voice\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nto engage you in a coaching dialogue\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nmodeled after trainers\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand patients and so forth.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAnd it would build a working alliance with you\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthrough that dialogue.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt could help you set goals and track your progress,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand it would help motivate you.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo an interesting question is,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\ndoes the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nIs it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nTo explore that question,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nwe did a study in the Boston area\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhere we put one of three interventions in people's homes\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nfor a period of several weeks.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nOne case was the robot you saw there, Autom.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnother was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nran exactly the same dialogues.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThe quality of advice was identical.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd the third was just a pen and paper log,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbecause that's the standard intervention you typically get\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhen you start a diet-and-exercise program.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo one of the things we really wanted to look at\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwas not how much weight people lost,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nbut really how long they interacted with the robot.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nBecause the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwell that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nSo the first thing I want to look at is how long,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nhow long did people interact with these systems.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt turns out that people interacted with the robot\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nsignificantly more,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\neven though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWhen it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\npeople rated the robot higher\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand they trusted the robot more.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd when you look at emotional engagement,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nit was completely different.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nPeople would name the robots.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nThey would dress the robots.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthey would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThey didn't do this with a computer.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nThe last thing I want to talk about today\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nis the future of children's media.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWe know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhether it's television or computer games or whatnot.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nMy sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nBut I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nlike, real-world play.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\ncalled Playtime Computing\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthat's really trying to think about how we can take\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nwhat's so engaging about digital media\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand literally bring it off the screen\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\ninto the real world of the child,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nwhere it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nSo here's the first exploration of this idea,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nwhere characters can be physical or virtual,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nand where the digital content\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\ncan literally come off the screen\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\ninto the world and back.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nI like to think of this\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nas the Atari Pong\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nof this blended-reality play.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut we can push this idea further.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nWhat if --\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\n(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nCB: -- the character itself could come into your world?\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt turns out that kids love it\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nwhen the character becomes real and enters into their world.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd when it's in their world,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nthey can relate to it and play with it in a way\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthat's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnother important idea is this notion\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nof persistence of character across realities.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nSo changes that children make in the real world\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nneed to translate to the virtual world.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nYou can imagine maybe these symbols\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\ngive the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo they are now sending the character back into that world.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nAnd now it's got number power.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd then finally, what I've been trying to do here\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nis create a really immersive experience for kids,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwhere they really feel like they are part of that story,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\na part of that experience.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd I really want to spark their imaginations\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthe way mine was sparked as a little girl watching \"Star Wars.\"\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nBut I want to do more than that.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nI actually want them to create those experiences.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nI want them to be able to literally build their imagination\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\ninto these experiences and make them their own.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSo we've been exploring a lot of ideas\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nin telepresence and mixed reality\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nto literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nwhere other kids can interact with them\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand build upon them.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nI really want to come up with new ways of children's media\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nthat foster creativity and learning and innovation.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI think that's very, very important.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo this is a new project.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nWe've invited a lot of kids into this space,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand they think it's pretty cool.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nBut I can tell you, the thing that they love the most\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nis the robot.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nWhat they care about is the robot.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nRobots touch something deeply human within us.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd so whether they're helping us\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nto become creative and innovative,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nor whether they're helping us\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nto feel more deeply connected despite distance,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nor whether they are our trusted sidekick\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nwho's helping us attain our personal goals\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nin becoming our highest and best selves,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nfor me, robots are all about people.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Mother and daughter doctor-heroes", "duration": "523", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mother_and_daughter_doctor_heroes_hawa_abdi_deqo_mohamed", "transcript": "Hawa Abdi: Many people \u2014 20 years for Somalia \u2014 [were] fighting. So there was no job, no food. Children, most of them, became very malnourished, like this. Deqo Mohamed: So as you know, always in a civil war, the ones affected most [are] the women and children. So our patients are women and children. And they are in our backyard. It's our home. We welcome them. That's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people, where 75 percent of them are women and children. Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside. HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations because people need some help. There is no government to protect them. DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients, maybe more or less. But sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses, and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them. But we take the severe ones, and we reschedule the other ones the next day. It is very tough. And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children; it's the women who come into the hospitals; it's the women [are] building the houses. That's their house. And we have a school. This is our bright \u2014 we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school where we have 850 children, and the majority are women and girls. (Applause) PM: And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. Would you explain the rules for admission? HA: The people who are coming to us, we are welcoming. We are sharing with them whatever we have. But there are only two rules. First rule: there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society. [Whomever] makes those things we throw out. The second: no man can beat his wife. If he beat, we will put [him] in jail, and we will call the eldest people. Until they identify this case, we'll never release him. That's our two rules. (Applause) The other thing that I have realized, that the woman is the most strong person all over the world. Because the last 20 years, the Somali woman has stood up. They were the leaders, and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations. We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. We can reconcile. We can do everything. (Applause) DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope, and the men are only killing in Somalia. So we came up with these two rules. In a camp with 90,000 people, you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. So there is no clan division, and no man can beat his wife. And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail. So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there. (Applause) So empowering the women and giving the opportunity \u2014 we are there for them. They are not alone for this. PM: You're running a medical clinic. It brought much, much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. You're also running a civil society. You've created your own rules, in which women and children are getting a different sense of security. Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi, and your decision, Dr. Mohamed, to work together \u2014 for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances. HA: My age \u2014 because I was born in 1947 \u2014 we were having, at that time, government, law and order. But one day, I went to the hospital \u2014 my mother was sick \u2014 and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors, how they [are] committed to help the sick people. I admired them, and I decided to become a doctor. My mother died, unfortunately, when I was 12 years [old]. Then my father allowed me to proceed [with] my hope. My mother died in [a] gynecology complication, so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. That's why I became a doctor. So Dr. Deqo has to explain. DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to. Maybe I should become an historian, or maybe a reporter. I loved it, but it didn't work. When the war broke out \u2014 civil war \u2014 I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help, and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children. And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist. (Laughter) So I went to Russia, and my mother also, [during the] time of [the] Soviet Union. So some of our character, maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. So that's how I decided [to do] the same. My sister was different. She's here. She's also a doctor. She graduated in Russia also. (Applause) And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war \u2014 when I was 16, and my sister was 11, when the civil war broke out. So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s \u2014 that's what made us go back and work for them. PM: So what is the biggest challenge working, mother and daughter, in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations? HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation, very dangerous. And when I saw the people who needed me, I was staying with them to help, because I [could] do something for them. Most people fled abroad. But I remained with those people, and I was trying to do something \u2014 [any] little thing I [could] do. I succeeded in my place. Now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other, who are not fighting. But we try to stand on our feet, to do something, little things, we can for our people. And I'm thankful for my daughters. When they come to me, they help me to treat the people, to help. They do everything for them. They have done what I desire to do for them. PM: What's the best part of working with your mother, and the most challenging part for you? DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging. She always expects us to do more. And really when you think [you] cannot do it, she will push you, and I can do it. That's the best part. She shows us, trains us how to do and how to be better [people] and how to do long hours in surgery \u2014 300 patients per day, 10, 20 surgeries, and still you have to manage the camp \u2014 that's how she trains us. It is not like beautiful offices here, 20 patients, you're tired. You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage. PM: But you do it for good reasons. (Applause) Wait. Wait. HA: Thank you. DM: Thank you. (Applause) HA: Thank you very much.

These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider. They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber, tougher than any fiber humans have ever made. The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature, extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn. This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away. That's roughly 10,000 times the range of man-made fire detectors. And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does, we could achieve factor 10, factor 100, maybe even factor 1,000 savings in resource and energy use. And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution, I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about. Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency. Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful, polluting way of using resources to a closed-loop model. And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. And for all three of these, I believe, biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products, and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period. And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it. So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. When we were working on the Eden Project, we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular, but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried. It was a hell of a challenge, and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. So for instance, it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons.The next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons. And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass, which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. So we started exploring this material called ETFE. It's a high-strength polymer. And what you do is you put it together in three layers, you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it. And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass, and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing. So that was a factor-100 saving. And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. So with such large, lightweight pillows, we had much less steel. With less steel we were getting more sunlight in, which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter. And with less overall weight in the superstructure, there were big savings in the foundations. And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency \u2014 delivering the same function, but with a fraction of the resource input. And actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions. So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies, whole buildings inspired by abalone shells, super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells. There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool.So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea. The way we tend to use resources is we extract them, we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them. Nature works very differently. In ecosystems, the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. And there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems. And one of my favorites is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project by Graham Wiles. And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste. It was ending up in landfills. Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste. And I'm just going to talk through this animation.So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants. They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it. They put it into worm recomposting systems, which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon, which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants. So it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model, and it created more value in the process. Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this, turning waste streams into schemes that create value. And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. And I know it's a quirky example, but I think the implications of this are quite radical, because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem \u2014 waste \u2014 into a massive opportunity.And particularly in cities \u2014 we could look at the whole metabolism of cities, and look at those as opportunities. And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about, the Mobius Project, where we're trying to bring together a number of activities, all within one building, so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. And the kind of elements I'm talking about are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse, a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas. Then we would have an anaerobic digester, which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area, turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid. We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro-organisms. We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food, energy and water and waste all within one building. And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London, which at the moment is a complete eyesore. Some of you may recognize this. And with just a little bit of planning, we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people, reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.So the final project I want to talk about is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment. It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa, huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests. And during the evolution of life on the Earth, it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy. The converse is also true. The more vegetation we lose, the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. And this animation, this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years, and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot, and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. The way it does this is it comes out at night, crawls to the top of a sand dune, and because it's got a matte black shell, is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings. So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea, you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell. Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth, has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day. And the ingenuity, if you could call it that, goes even further. Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell, there are lots of little bumps on that shell. And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water. Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps, they stay in tight, spherical beads, which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air, it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource-constrained environment \u2014 and in that sense, very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years, next few decades.We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions, and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills, and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process. So inside it's cool and humid, which means the plants need less water to grow. And then at the back of the greenhouse, it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. So they just started spreading this on the land around, and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. This photograph was taken on completion day, and just one year later, it looked like that. So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land \u2014 and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design.So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits. And when you think about nature, often you think about it as being all about competition. But actually in mature ecosystems, you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. And the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse is concentrated solar power, which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP, consider that we receive 10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms \u2014 10,000 times. So our energy problems are not intractable. It's a challenge to our ingenuity. And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts. CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. CSP produces a lot of waste heat. We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. And finally, in the shade under the mirrors, it's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight. So this is how this scheme would look. The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind. We'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way.Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts. And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource, you don't think, \"How am I going to dispose of this?\" You think, \"What can I add to the system to create more value?\" And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. And that builds up on the evaporators \u2014 and that's what that image on the left is \u2014 gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate. So after a while, we could take that out, use it as a lightweight building block. And if you think about the carbon in that, that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea and then locked away in a building product.The next thing is sodium chloride. You can also compress that into a building block, as they did here. This is a hotel in Bolivia. And then after that, there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract, like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them. And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high-performance batteries. And in parts of the Arabian Gulf, the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse. Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts, transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity. Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food, abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas.So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning: radical increases in resource efficiency, closing loops and a solar economy. They're not just possible; they're critical. And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language. But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing. And this is an important point.Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said, \"If you want to build a flotilla of ships, you don't sit around talking about carpentry. No, you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores.\" And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive, and let's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1072, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nThese are spinneret glands\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\non the abdomen of a spider.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThey produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\ntougher than any fiber humans have ever made.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nThe nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nextremes of pressure and loads of pollution.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nAnd yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwith raw materials of dead flies and water.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nIt does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nThis beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nThat's roughly 10,000 times the range\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nof man-made fire detectors.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nconnected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nSo these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nIf we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nwe could achieve factor 10, factor 100,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nmaybe even factor 1,000 savings\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nin resource and energy use.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nI believe there are three really big changes\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nwe need to bring about.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nFirstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nSecondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\npolluting way of using resources\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nto a closed-loop model.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto a solar economy.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd for all three of these, I believe,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nbiomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nYou could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand all of those have benefited\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nfrom a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAnd given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nAnd let's start with radical increases\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nin resource efficiency.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nWhen we were working on the Eden Project,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwe had to create a very large greenhouse\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nin a site that was not only irregular,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nbut it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nIt was a hell of a challenge,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand it was actually examples from biology\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nthat provided a lot of the clues.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo for instance,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nit was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthat would work regardless of the final ground levels.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nStudying pollen grains\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand radiolaria and carbon molecules\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nhelped us devise the most efficient structural solution\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nusing hexagons and pentagons.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThe next move was that we wanted\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nto try and maximize the size of those hexagons.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwhich is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd in nature there are lots of examples\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nof very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSo we started exploring this material called ETFE.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nIt's a high-strength polymer.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd what you do is you put it together in three layers,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nyou weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd the great thing about this stuff\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nis you can make it in units\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nof roughly seven times the size of glass,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSo that was a factor-100 saving.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd what we found is that we got into a positive cycle\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin which one breakthrough facilitated another.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo with such large, lightweight pillows,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nwe had much less steel.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nWith less steel we were getting more sunlight in,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nwhich meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd with less overall weight in the superstructure,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthere were big savings in the foundations.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nAnd at the end of the project we worked out\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat the weight of that superstructure\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwas actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nof how ideas from biology\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\ncan lead to radical increases in resource efficiency --\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\ndelivering the same function,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nbut with a fraction of the resource input.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd actually there are loads of examples in nature\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat you could turn to for similar solutions.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nSo for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbased on giant Amazon water lilies,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwhole buildings inspired by abalone shells,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nsuper-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nThere's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nusing nature as a design tool.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nSo now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThe way we tend to use resources\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nis we extract them,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nwe turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNature works very differently.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIn ecosystems, the waste from one organism\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nbecomes the nutrient for something else in that system.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd there are some examples of projects\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd one of my favorites\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nis called the Cardboard to Caviar Project\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nby Graham Wiles.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthat were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt was ending up in landfills.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNow the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd I'm just going to talk through this animation.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSo they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThey then shredded the cardboard\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nWhen that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThey put it into worm recomposting systems,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwhich produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwhich produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nSo it transformed a linear process\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\ninto a closed-loop model,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand it created more value in the process.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nGraham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nturning waste streams into schemes that create value.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd just as natural systems\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\ntend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthere's a real sense with this project\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nthat the number of possibilities\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\njust continue increasing.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd I know it's a quirky example,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nbut I think the implications of this are quite radical,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nbecause it suggests that we could actually\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\ntransform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd particularly in cities --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwe could look at the whole metabolism of cities,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand look at those as opportunities.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAnd that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nthe Mobius Project,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwhere we're trying to bring together a number of activities,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nall within one building,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nso that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd the kind of elements I'm talking about\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nare, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\na bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThen we would have an anaerobic digester,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwhich could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nturn that into heat for the greenhouse\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand electricity to feed back into the grid.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe'd have a water treatment system\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\ntreating wastewater, turning that into fresh water\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand generating energy from the solids\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nusing just plants and micro-organisms.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nWe'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand worms from the compost\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand supplying fish back to the restaurant.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\ncould be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo you can see that we're bringing together\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\ncycles of food, energy and water and waste\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nall within one building.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwhich at the moment is a complete eyesore.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSome of you may recognize this.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd with just a little bit of planning,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwe could transform a space dominated by traffic\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\ninto one that provides open space for people,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nreconnects people with food\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nSo the final project I want to talk about\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nis the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIt may come as a surprise to some of you\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nto hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwere actually forested a fairly short time ago.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nSo for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nhuge areas of North Africa\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwere covered in cedar and cypress forests.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd during the evolution of life on the Earth,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nit was the colonization\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nof the land by plants\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThe converse is also true.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe more vegetation we lose,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe more that's likely to exacerbate climate change\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand lead to further desertification.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd this animation,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthis shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nshift quite a lot,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand that raises the question\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nof whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nto halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd if you look at some of the organisms\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nthat have evolved to live in deserts,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthere are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nThis is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThe way it does this is it comes out at night,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\ncrawls to the top of a sand dune,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand because it's got a matte black shell,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis able to radiate heat out to the night sky\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nand become slightly cooler than its surroundings.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nSo when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nyou get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nJust before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nhas a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd the ingenuity, if you could call it that,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\ngoes even further.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nBecause if you look closely at the beetle's shell,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthere are lots of little bumps on that shell.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nBetween them there's a waxy finish which repels water.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd the effect of this is that\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nas the droplets start to form on the bumps,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthey stay in tight, spherical beads,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwhich means they're much more mobile\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthan they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nit's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo amazing example of an adaptation\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nto a very resource-constrained environment --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand in that sense, very relevant\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nto the kind of challenges we're going to be facing\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nover the next few years, next few decades.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nWe're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nThis is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand you trickle seawater over that\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nso that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand is cooled in the process.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo inside it's cool and humid,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwhich means the plants need less water to grow.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd then at the back of the greenhouse,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nin a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwas it was producing slightly more freshwater\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nthan it needed for the plants inside.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo they just started spreading this on the land around,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand the combination of that and the elevated humidity\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nhad quite a dramatic effect on the local area.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nThis photograph was taken on completion day,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand just one year later, it looked like that.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nSo it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nturning barren land back into biologically productive land --\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand in that sense, going beyond sustainable design\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nto achieve restorative design.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nSo we were keen to scale this up\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nand apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd when you think about nature,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\noften you think about it as being all about competition.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBut actually in mature ecosystems,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nyou're just as likely to find examples\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nof symbiotic relationships.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nSo an important biomimicry principle\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nis to find ways of bringing technologies together\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nin symbiotic clusters.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd the technology that we settled on\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nas an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nis concentrated solar power,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nwhich uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nto create electricity.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nconsider that we receive\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\n10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nas we use in energy from all forms --\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\n10,000 times.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSo our energy problems are not intractable.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nIt's a challenge to our ingenuity.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd the kind of synergies I'm talking about\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nare, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nCSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThat's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nCSP produces a lot of waste heat.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWe'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand enhance the restorative benefits.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd finally, in the shade under the mirrors,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nit's possible to grow all sorts of crops\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthat would not grow in direct sunlight.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nSo this is how this scheme would look.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nThe idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nWe'd have concentrated solar power plants\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nat intervals along the way.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSome of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nyou don't think, \"How am I going to dispose of this?\"\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nYou think, \"What can I add to the system to create more value?\"\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd it turns out\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthat different things crystallize out at different stages.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nWhen you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nis calcium carbonate.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd that builds up on the evaporators --\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand that's what that image on the left is --\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\ngradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo after a while, we could take that out,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nuse it as a lightweight building block.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd if you think about the carbon in that,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand then locked away in a building product.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThe next thing is sodium chloride.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nYou can also compress that into a building block,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nas they did here.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThis is a hotel in Bolivia.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd then after that, there are all sorts\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nof compounds and elements that we can extract,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nlike phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nAnd there's just about every element of the periodic table\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nin seawater.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nSo it should be possible to extract valuable elements\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nlike lithium for high-performance batteries.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd in parts of the Arabian Gulf,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthe seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\ndue to the discharge of waste brine\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfrom desalination plants.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nNow we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nWe could evaporate it\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto enhance the restorative benefits\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nand capture the salts,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\ntransforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nReally the Sahara Forest Project is a model\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nfor how we could create zero-carbon food,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nabundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nas well as reversing desertification in certain areas.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nradical increases in resource efficiency,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nclosing loops and a solar economy.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nThey're not just possible; they're critical.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwill provide a lot of the solutions.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nBut perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nis a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nFar too much of the talk about the environment\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nuses very negative language.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nBut here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd this is an important point.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery once said,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\n\"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nyou don't sit around talking about carpentry.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nNo, you need to set people's souls ablaze\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nwith visions of exploring distant shores.\"\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand let's make progress with what could be\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthe most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A whistleblower you haven't heard", "duration": "716",

That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland \u2014 why is he whistling? Well actually, I've been whistling since the age of four, about four. My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually, until I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone, I whistled in the classroom, I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.(Laughter)So when \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" \u2014 you know it?(Whistling)But it can also sound like this.(Whistling)But during a Christmas party \u2014 at dinner, actually \u2014 it's very annoying. So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, \"Please stop whistling.\" And I just couldn't. And at one point \u2014 and I had some wine, I have to admit that \u2014 at one point I said, \"If there was a contest, I would join.\"And two weeks later, I received a text message: \"You're going to America.\"(Laughter)So, OK, I'm going to America. I would love to, but why? So I immediately called her up, of course. She googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course.(Laughter)She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.(Laughter)I lost my face.(Applause)And she thought, \"He will never go there.\" But actually, I did. So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast of the United States, and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the World Championship, and I won there, in 2004.(Applause)That was great fun, of course. And to defend my title \u2014 like judokas do and sportsmen \u2014 I thought, well let's go back in 2005 \u2014 and I won again.(Laughter)Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in 2008, I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. And actually, I earn my money whistling, at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse.(Applause)And I try to live my dream \u2014 well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.(Laughter)OK, I'm not the only one whistling here. You say, \"Huh, what do you mean?\" Well actually, you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, \"Oh, my God. Why? Can I go away?\" No, you can't.(Laughter)Actually, it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called \"F\u00eate de la Belle.\" It's about 80 minutes long.(Laughter)No, no, no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. Yes, so I whistle the tone.(Whistling)(Laughter)Sorry, I forgot one thing \u2014 you whistle the same tone as me.(Laughter)I heard a wide variety of tones.(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)(Whistling ends)This is very promising.(Laughter)This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens.(Laughter)Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians.(Laughter)I'm so used to that.(Laughter)I start it myself.(Laughter)OK, here it is.(Laughter)(Music)(Whistling)(Whistling ends)(Music)OK.(Whistling)It's easy, isn't it?(Whistling)Now comes the solo, I propose I do that myself, OK?(Music)(Whistling)(Applause)Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion of Whistling.Geert Chatrou: Thank you.

Thank you."}, {"title": "Reconnecting with compassion", "duration": "953", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/krista_tippett_reconnecting_with_compassion", "transcript": "We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word \"compassion\" is hollowed out in our culture, and it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing, or it's seen as potentially depressing. Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and, after the fact, the word \"compassion\" was translated as \"pity.\"Now compassion, when it enters the news, too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter, that they shape the way we understand ourselves, the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others.When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s, we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. Now the word \"tolerance,\" if you look at it in the dictionary, connotes \"allowing,\" \"indulging\" and \"enduring.\" In the medical context that it comes from, it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. Tolerance is not really a lived virtue; it's more of a cerebral ascent. And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. And the going is pretty rough right now. I think that without perhaps being able to name it, we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue.Compassion is a worthy successor. It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them. Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others, both in our private and in our civic spaces. So what is it, three-dimensionally? What are its kindred and component parts? What's in its universe of attendant virtues? To start simply, I want to say that compassion is kind. Now \"kindness\" might sound like a very mild word, and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification.Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles, Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims, and as they do that, they cultivate what they call \"curiosity without assumptions.\" Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up. I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty \u2014 and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping. I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery \u2014 encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other.I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like, but I can show you what compassion looks like \u2014 because it is visible. When we see it, we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable, what is possible. It is so important when we're communicating big ideas \u2014 but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion \u2014 to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood \u2014 the color and complexity of life.And compassion does seek physicality. I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him, but he's paraplegic. He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13, in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again, and \u2014 and he does experience this as an \"and\" rather than a \"but\" \u2014 and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. And as a teacher of yoga, he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability, health, illness and aging. He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. I can't quite explain it, and he can't either. But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body, in all its frailty and its grace, without, at the same time, becoming more compassionate towards all of life.Compassion also looks like this. This is Jean Vanier. Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities, which you can now find all over the world, communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities \u2014 mostly Down syndrome. The communities that Jean Vanier founded, like Jean Vanier himself, exude tenderness. \"Tender\" is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive, and I spend a lot of time being those things too. And compassion can also have those qualities. But again and again, lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. Jean Vanier says that his work, like the work of other people \u2014 his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa \u2014 is never in the first instance about changing the world; it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign. Compassion is rarely a solution, but it is always a sign of a deeper reality, of deeper human possibilities.And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories, never by statistics and strategies. We need those things too, but we're also bumping up against their limits. And at the same time that we are doing that, I think we are rediscovering the power of story \u2014 that as human beings, we need stories to survive, to flourish, to change. Our traditions have always known this, and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. There is, of course, a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world \u2014 tikkun olam.And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world. Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time, because this story insists that each and every one of us, frail and flawed as we may be, inadequate as we may feel, has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch.Stories like this, signs like this, are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing, how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine \u2014 the work Fred Luskin is doing \u2014 I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century \u2014 that science, in fact, is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. This is going to change science, I believe, and it will change religion.But here's a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E = mc2. We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson, to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South.Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century. He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old. And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced, we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more, not less. He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. Some of his favorites were Moses, Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi, Gandhi \u2014 he adored his contemporary, Gandhi. And Einstein said \u2014 and I think this is a quote, again, that has not been passed down in his legacy \u2014 that \"these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge.\"Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us, but actually it is. I want to show you the rest of this photograph, because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word \"compassion\" in our culture \u2014 we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life, which is messy. So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral \u2014 it's not. This is the full photograph, and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket, smoking a cigar. And by the look of that paunch, he hasn't been doing enough yoga. We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website, and someone said, \"When I look at the first photo, I ask myself, what was he thinking? And when I look at the second, I ask, what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?\"Well, he was complicated. He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. And it is much harder, often, to be compassionate towards those closest to us, which is another quality in the universe of compassion, on its dark side, that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being. So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day. So was Mother Teresa. So are we all. And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion \u2014 following on what Fred Luskin says \u2014 that these flaws just make us human.Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems, in fact, are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion, towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease. Einstein became a humanitarian, not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter, but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that, with a zigzag, have led to the Charter for Compassion. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity.So I want to propose a final definition of compassion \u2014 this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way \u2014 and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this, and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious.So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity, the future of humanity, needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1074, "subtitle":

if you look at it in the dictionary,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nconnotes \"allowing,\" \"indulging\"\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand \"enduring.\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIn the

00:02:20.958\nthat we've come as far as we can\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nwith tolerance as our only guiding virtue.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nCompassion is a worthy

00:02:57.958\nTo start simply,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nI want to say that compassion is kind.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nNow \"kindness\" might sound like a very mild word,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand it's prone to its own abundant cliche.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBut kindness is an everyday byproduct\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nof all the great virtues.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd it is a most edifying form\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nof instant gratification.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nCompassion is also

up.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nI think that compassion\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nalso is often linked to beauty --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand by that I mean a willingness\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nto see beauty in the other,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nnot just what it is about them\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthat might need

00:04:40.958\nencouraging us not just\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nto see beauty,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nbut perhaps also to look for the face of God\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nin the moment of suffering,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nin the face of a stranger,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nin the face of the vibrant religious other.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI'm not sure if I can show you\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwhat tolerance looks like,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nbut I can show you what compassion looks like

--\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nbut especially a big spiritual idea like compassion --\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nto root it as we present it to others\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nin

00:05:29.958\nI first started to learn this most vividly\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nfrom Matthew Sanford.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I don't imagine that you will realize

waist down since he was 13,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nin a car crash that killed his father and his sister.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nMatthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand -- and he does experience this as an \"and\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nrather than a \"but\" --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand he experiences himself\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nto be healed and whole.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd as a teacher of yoga,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nhe brings that experience to others\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nacross the spectrum of ability and disability,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nhealth, illness and aging.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nHe says that he's just at an extreme end\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nof the spectrum we're all on.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nHe's doing some amazing work now\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nwith veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd Matthew has made this remarkable observation\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI can't quite explain it, and he can't either.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nBut he says that he has yet to experience someone\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwho became more aware of their body,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nin all its frailty and its grace,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nwithout, at the same time,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nbecoming more compassionate towards all of life.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nCompassion also looks like this.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThis is Jean Vanier.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nJean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwhich you can now find all over the world,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\ncommunities centered around life\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwith people with mental disabilities --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nmostly Down syndrome.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThe communities that Jean Vanier founded,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nlike Jean Vanier himself,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nexude tenderness.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\n\"Tender\" is another word\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI would love to spend some time resurrecting.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nWe spend so much time in this culture\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nbeing driven and aggressive,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand I spend a lot of time being those things too.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd compassion can also have those qualities.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nBut again and again, lived compassion\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nbrings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nJean Vanier says\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthat his work,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nlike the work of other people --\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhis great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa --\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nis never in the first instance about changing the world;\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nit's in the first instance about changing ourselves.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nHe's says that what they do with L'Arche\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nis not a solution, but a sign.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nCompassion is rarely a solution,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nbut it is always a sign of a deeper reality,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nof deeper human possibilities.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd compassion is unleashed\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin wider and wider circles\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nby signs and stories,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nnever by statistics and strategies.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWe need those things too,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nbut we're also bumping up against their limits.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd at the same time that we are doing that,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nI think we are rediscovering the power of story --\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat as human beings, we need stories\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nto survive, to flourish,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nto change.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nOur traditions have always known this,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand carried them forward in time for us.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThere is, of course, a story\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nbehind the key moral longing\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nand commandment of Judaism\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto repair the world -- tikkun olam.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd I'll never forget hearing that story\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nfrom Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwho told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat in the beginning of the Creation\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nsomething happened\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand the original light of the universe\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwas shattered into countless pieces.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIt lodged as shards\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\ninside every aspect of the Creation.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd that the highest human calling\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nis to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nto gather it up,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nand in so doing, to repair the world.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nNow this might sound like a fanciful tale.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSome of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nRachel Naomi Remen says\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthis is an important and empowering story\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nfor our time,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nbecause this story insists\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthat each and every one of us,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nfrail and flawed as we may be,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\ninadequate as we may feel,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nhas exactly what's needed\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nto help repair the part of the world\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthat we can see and touch.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nStories like this,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nsigns like this,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nare practical tools\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nin a world longing to bring compassion\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nto abundant images of suffering\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthat can otherwise overwhelm us.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nRachel Naomi Remen\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nis actually bringing compassion\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nback to its rightful place alongside science\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nin her field of medicine\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nin the training of new doctors.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd this trend\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nof what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nhow these kinds of virtues\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nare finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine --\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nthe work Fred Luskin is doing --\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nI think this is one of the most fascinating developments\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nof the 21st century --\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat science, in fact,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nis taking a virtue like compassion\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\ndefinitively out of the realm of idealism.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThis is going to change science, I believe,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand it will change religion.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut here's a face\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nfrom 20th century science\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthat might surprise you\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nin a discussion about compassion.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nWe all know about the Albert Einstein\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwho came up with E = mc2.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nWe don't hear so much about the Einstein\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nwho invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbecause the best hotel there\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwas segregated and wouldn't have her.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWe don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nto advocate for political prisoners in Europe\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nor the Scottsboro boys\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nin the American South.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nEinstein believed deeply\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthat science should transcend\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nnational and ethnic divisions.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nBut he watched physicists and chemists\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nbecome the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nin the early 20th century.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nHe once said that science in his generation\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nhad become like a razor blade\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nin the hands of a three-year-old.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd Einstein foresaw\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat as we grow more modern\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand technologically advanced,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwe need the virtues\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nour traditions carry forward in time\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nmore, not less.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nHe liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSome of his favorites were Moses,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nJesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nGandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd Einstein said --\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand I think this is a quote,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nagain, that has not been passed down in his legacy --\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nthat \"these kinds of people\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nare geniuses in the art of living,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nmore necessary\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto the dignity, security and joy of humanity\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthan the discoverers of objective knowledge.\"\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nNow invoking Einstein\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nmight not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nbut actually it is.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nI want to show you\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthe rest of this photograph,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nbecause this photograph\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nis analogous to what we do to the word \"compassion\" in our culture --\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwe clean it up\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand we diminish its depths and its grounding\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nin life, which is messy.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nSo in this photograph\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nyou see a mind looking out a window\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nat what might be a cathedral -- it's not.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThis is the full photograph,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nand you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nsmoking a cigar.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd by the look of that paunch,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nhe hasn't been doing enough yoga.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nWe put these two photographs side-by-side on our

What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see. What's going on up in that little brain of hers. The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the \"celestial openness\" of the child's mind.What we see here is a mother in India, and she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language. And she's talking to her baby. What this mother \u2014 and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world \u2014 understands is that, to preserve this language, they need to speak it to the babies. And therein lies a critical puzzle. Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I, to the adults? Well, it's got to do with your brain. What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.(Laughter)And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language. The babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline. After puberty, we fall off the map. No scientists dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way.Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development, and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. We think, by studying how the sounds are learned, we'll have a model for the rest of language, and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social, emotional and cognitive development. So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. The baby sits on a parent's lap, and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes \u2014 like from \"ah\" to \"ee.\" If they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. A six-monther adores the task.What have we learned? Well, babies all over the world are what I like to describe as \"citizens of the world.\" They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages, no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using, and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. We're culture-bound listeners. We can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages. So the question arises: When do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are? And the answer: before their first birthdays. What you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States, here in Seattle, as they listened to \"ra\" and \"la\" \u2014 sounds important to English, but not to Japanese. So at six to eight months, the babies are totally equivalent. Two months later, something incredible occurs. The babies in the United States are getting a lot better, babies in Japan are getting a lot worse, but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn.So the question is: What's happening during this critical two-month period? This is the critical period for sound development, but what's going on up there? So there are two things going on. The first is that the babies are listening intently to us, and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk \u2014 they're taking statistics. So listen to two mothers speaking motherese \u2014 the universal language we use when we talk to kids \u2014 first in English and then in Japanese.(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes \u2014 so pretty and nice.(Japanese)Patricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen, what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. And those distributions grow. And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics, and the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different. English has a lot of Rs and Ls. The distribution shows. And the distribution of Japanese is totally different, where we see a group of intermediate sounds, which is known as the Japanese \"R.\" So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are. But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics. We are governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development.So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them, one after the other, depending on who they're speaking to.So we asked ourselves, can the babies take statistics on a brand new language? And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. We knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern. Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent. Two months later, something incredible happens. But the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies. What we did was expose American babies, during this period, to Mandarin. It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions. Here's what it looked like in the laboratory.(Mandarin)PK: So what have we done to their little brains?(Laughter)We had to run a control group to make sure that coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. So a group of babies came in and listened to English. And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions. They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for 10 and a half months. What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. Whatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on.But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise. So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage, the same 12 sessions, but over a television set. And another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. What did we do to their brains? What you see here is the audio result \u2014 no learning whatsoever \u2014 and the video result \u2014 no learning whatsoever. It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics.We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings. Thankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography, that allows us to do this. It looks like a hair dryer from Mars. But it's completely safe, completely noninvasive and silent. We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using 306 SQUIDs \u2014 these are superconducting quantum interference devices \u2014 to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking. We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning.So this is little Emma. She's a six-monther. And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. You can see, she can move around. We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap, so she's free to move completely unconstrained. It's a technical tour de force. What are we seeing? We're seeing the baby brain. As the baby hears a word in her language, the auditory areas light up, and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence, getting the brain coordinated with its different areas, and causality, one brain area causing another to activate.We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development. We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read, as they solve a math problem, as they have an idea. And we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. Just as the poets and writers described, we're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness, utter and complete openness, of the mind of a child. In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1075, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:15.665\nI want you to take a look at this baby.\n\n00:00:16.137

your big blue eyes --\n\n00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:06.958\nso pretty and nice.\n\n00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:13.934\n(Japanese)\n\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.777\nPatricia Kuhl: During the production\nof speech, when babies listen,\n\n00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:22.570\nwhat they're doing is taking statistics\non the language that they hear.\n\n00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:26.221\nAnd those distributions grow.\n\n00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:30.618\nAnd what we've learned is that babies\nare sensitive to the statistics,\n\n00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:34.470\nand the statistics of Japanese\nand English are very, very different.\n\n00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:37.151\nEnglish has a lot of Rs and Ls.\n\n00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:38.934\nThe distribution shows.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.798\nAnd the distribution of Japanese\nis totally different,\n\n00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:44.823\nwhere we see a group\nof intermediate sounds,\n\n00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.262\nwhich is known as the Japanese \"R.\"\n\n00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:51.394\nSo babies absorb\nthe statistics of the language\n\n00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:53.096\nand it changes their brains;\n\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.271\nit changes them\nfrom the citizens of the world\n\n00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.241\nto the culture-bound\nlisteners that we are.\n\n00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:02.978\nBut we as adults are no longer\nabsorbing those statistics.\n\n00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.559\nWe are governed\nby the representations in memory\n\n00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:08.132\nthat were formed early in development.\n\n00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:09.934\nSo what we're seeing here\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.191\nis changing our models\nof what the critical period is about.\n\n00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:15.984\nWe're arguing from\na mathematical standpoint\n\n00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:19.148\nthat the learning of language\nmaterial may slow down\n\n00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:21.552\nwhen our distributions stabilize.\n\n00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:24.438\nIt's raising lots of questions\nabout bilingual people.\n\n00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:28.907\nBilinguals must keep two sets\nof statistics in mind at once\n\n00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.814\nand flip between them,\none after the other,\n\n00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:33.610\ndepending on who they're speaking to.\n\n00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:34.788\nSo we asked ourselves,\n\n00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:38.219\ncan the babies take statistics\non a brand new language?\n\n00:05:38.243 --> 00:05:41.521\nAnd we tested this\nby exposing American babies\n\n00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:43.234\nwho'd never heard a second language\n\n00:05:43.258 --> 00:05:45.974\nto Mandarin for the first time\nduring the critical period.\n\n00:05:45.998 --> 00:05:49.535\nWe knew that, when monolinguals\nwere tested in Taipei and Seattle\n\n00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.221\non the Mandarin sounds,\nthey showed the same pattern.\n\n00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:54.716\nSix to eight months,\nthey're totally equivalent.\n\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.276\nTwo months later,\nsomething incredible happens.\n\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.852\nBut the Taiwanese babies are getting\nbetter, not the American babies.\n\n00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:05.758\nWhat we did was expose American babies,\nduring this period, to Mandarin.\n\n00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.790\nIt was like having Mandarin relatives\ncome and visit for a month\n\n00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:12.611\nand move into your house\nand talk to the babies for 12 sessions.\n\n00:06:12.635 --> 00:06:14.841\nHere's what it looked like\nin the laboratory.\n\n00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:20.421\n(Mandarin)\n\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.866\nPK: So what have we done\nto their little brains?\n\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.629\nWe had to run a control group to make sure\n\n00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.865\nthat coming into the laboratory\ndidn't improve your Mandarin skills.\n\n00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.542\nSo a group of babies came in\nand listened to English.\n\n00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:50.968\nAnd we can see from the graph\n\n00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:53.575\nthat exposure to English\ndidn't improve their Mandarin.\n\n00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.194\nBut look at what happened to the babies\nexposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.\n\n00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:59.618\nThey were as good as the babies in Taiwan\n\n00:06:59.642 --> 00:07:02.618\nwho'd been listening\nfor 10 and a half months.\n\n00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:06.466\nWhat it demonstrated is that babies\ntake statistics on a new language.\n\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.934\nWhatever you put in front of them,\nthey'll take statistics on.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.548\nBut we wondered what role\n\n00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:15.809\nthe human being played\nin this learning exercise.\n\n00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:20.442\nSo we ran another group of babies\nin which the kids got the same dosage,\n\n00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.934\nthe same 12 sessions,\nbut over a television set.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.619\nAnd another group of babies\nwho had just audio exposure\n\n00:07:26.643 --> 00:07:28.731\nand looked at a teddy bear on the screen.\n\n00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:30.934\nWhat did we do to their brains?\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.333\nWhat you see here is the audio result --\n\n00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.619\nno learning whatsoever --\n\n00:07:36.643 --> 00:07:38.401\nand the video result --\n\n00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:41.039\nno learning whatsoever.\n\n00:07:41.063 --> 00:07:45.204\nIt takes a human being\nfor babies to take their statistics.\n\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.746\nThe social brain is controlling\n\n00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.875\nwhen the babies\nare taking their statistics.\n\n00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:53.392\nWe want to get inside the brain\nand see this thing happening\n\n00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:57.354\nas babies are in front of televisions,\nas opposed to in front of human beings.\n\n00:07:57.378 --> 00:08:02.075\nThankfully, we have a new machine,\nmagnetoencephalography,\n\n00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:03.392\nthat allows us to do this.\n\n00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.001\nIt looks like a hair dryer from Mars.\n\n00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:10.508\nBut it's completely safe,\ncompletely noninvasive and silent.\n\n00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.975\nWe're looking at millimeter accuracy\n\n00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:16.315\nwith regard to spatial\nand millisecond accuracy\n\n00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:18.961\nusing 306 SQUIDs --\n\n00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:22.085\nthese are superconducting\nquantum interference devices --\n\n00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:25.740\nto pick up the magnetic fields\nthat change as we do our thinking.\n\n00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:31.816\nWe're the first in the world\nto record babies in an MEG machine\n\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.231\nwhile they are learning.\n\n00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:35.934\nSo this is little Emma.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.866\nShe's a six-monther.\n\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:43.008\nAnd she's listening to various languages\nin the earphones that are in her ears.\n\n00:08:43.032 --> 00:08:45.256\nYou can see, she can move around.\n\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.050\nWe're tracking her head\nwith little pellets in a cap,\n\n00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:52.049\nso she's free to move\ncompletely unconstrained.\n\n00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.286\nIt's a technical tour de force.\n\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.894\nWhat are we seeing?\n\n00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:57.812\nWe're seeing the baby brain.\n\n00:08:57.836 --> 00:09:03.122\nAs the baby hears a word in her language,\nthe auditory areas light up,\n\n00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:07.934\nand then subsequently areas surrounding it\nthat we think are related to coherence,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.934\ngetting the brain coordinated\nwith its different areas, and causality,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.934\none brain area\ncausing another to activate.\n\n00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:20.943\nWe are embarking on a grand\nand golden age of knowledge\n\n00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:23.203\nabout child's brain development.\n\n00:09:23.227 --> 00:09:25.648\nWe're going to be able\nto see a child's brain\n\n00:09:25.672 --> 00:09:29.913\nas they experience an emotion,\nas they learn to speak and read,\n\n00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:33.139\nas they solve a math problem,\nas they have an idea.\n\n00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:36.822\nAnd we're going to be able to invent\nbrain-based interventions\n\n00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:39.116\nfor children who have difficulty learning.\n\n00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:42.595\nJust as the poets and writers described,\n\n00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:46.773\nwe're going to be able to see, I think,\nthat wondrous openness,\n\n00:09:46.797 --> 00:09:50.221\nutter and complete openness,\nof the mind of a child.\n\n00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:53.658\nIn investigating the child's brain,\n\n00:09:53.682 --> 00:09:57.678\nwe're going to uncover deep truths\nabout what it means to be human,\n\n00:09:57.702 --> 00:09:58.857\nand in the process,\n\n00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:01.952\nwe may be able to help keep\nour own minds open to learning\n\n00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.667\nfor our entire lives.\n\n00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:04.934\nThank you.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Inspiring a life of immersion", "duration": "1068", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jacqueline_novogratz_inspiring_a_life_of_immersion", "transcript": "I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days, talking to groups of students and professionals, and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. On the one hand, people say, \"The time for change is now.\" They want to be part of it. They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning. But on the other hand, I hear people talking about fear, a sense of risk-aversion. They say, \"I really want to follow a life of purpose, but I don't know where to start. I don't want to disappoint my family or friends.\" I work in global poverty. And they say, \"I want to work in global poverty, but what will it mean about my career? Will I be marginalized? Will I not make enough money? Will I never get married or have children?\" And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older \u2014 and I'm glad I waited \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and has no children, I look at these young people and I say, \"Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is only to be human. And nothing important happens in life without a cost.\" These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. Our leaders and ourselves want everything, but we don't talk about the costs. We don't talk about the sacrifice.One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen, the great American writer from the South. In a short story called \"Oh Yes,\" she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl, and she looks at her child with a sense of pride, but she also wonders, what price will she pay? \"Better immersion than to live untouched.\" But the real question is, what is the cost of not daring? What is the cost of not trying?I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion. One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. She was a leader of the Menominee tribe, a Native American peoples. And when we would gather as fellows, she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions. And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future, looking at them from the Earth, and they would look at them, holding them as stewards for that future. Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other, not only as human beings, but to every living thing on the planet.And tragically, in 1999, when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people, focused on preserving their culture and language, she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. And whenever we would gather the fellows after that, we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. And more than a decade later, when I talk to NGO fellows, whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House, and we talk about Ingrid, they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission. And when we think about legacy, I can think of no more powerful one, despite how short her life was.And I've been touched by Cambodian women \u2014 beautiful women, women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia. And I met them in the early '90s. In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime, the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people, and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals, the artists, the dancers. And at the end of the war, there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living. And the women, who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors, told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps. They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance, hoping that others were alive and doing the same.And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was. And these big tears fell down her face, but she never lifted her hands to move them. And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already, but the next generation. And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands \u2014 beautiful rhythms \u2014 as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them, wearing these beautiful silk colors. And I thought, after all this atrocity, this is how human beings really pray. Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future. And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure.I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership. And I have learned that power, particularly in its absolute form, is an equal opportunity provider. In 1986, I moved to Rwanda, and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank. And one of the women was Agnes \u2014 there on your extreme left \u2014 she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda, and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda. We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women.But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end. And though she had been part of building a liberal party, a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance, about three months before the genocide, she switched parties and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power, and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. And I would visit her in the prisons, sitting side-by-side, knees touching, and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us, but that maybe it's not monsters so much, but the broken parts of ourselves, sadnesses, secret shame, and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts, those fragments, if you will, and to make us look at other beings, human beings, as lesser than ourselves \u2014 and in the extreme, to do terrible things.And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male. And so in a gathering where we're focused on women, while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them, we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered, unable to provide. And that, when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job, no education, no possibility, well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun.Sometimes very small investments can release enormous, infinite potential that exists in all of us. One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization, Suraj Sudhakar, has what we call moral imagination \u2014 the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera. And they're incredible guys. And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums, and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. And then they created a business plan competition. Then they decided that they would do TEDx's.And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. Alex, in some ways, said it best. He said, \"We used to feel like nobodies, but now we feel like somebodies.\" And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other. And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV, or at best, microfinance. And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare \u2014 the photojournalists and the creatives, the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs. And they're doing it. And my hat's off to you in Kibera.My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive. At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital \u2014 money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity, but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. We leave our money for 10 to 15 years, and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations that focus on change. I know it works. We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies, and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets. This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services like maternal health care and housing, emergency services, solar energy, so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems.Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions, easy categories, because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact, measuring what is most important to us. And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it, but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change.Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side \u2014 one based on violence and the other on transcendence. I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim. And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives, but they did more, because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear and certainly despair.But less than 24 hours, I was 13 miles away from those mosques, visiting one of our Acumen investees, an incredible man, Jawad Aslam, who dares to live a life of immersion. Born and raised in Baltimore, he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate, and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend, but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital, but he continued to pay a price. He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes. It took almost two years just to register the land. But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action.Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses in this beautiful community. And there's schools and clinics and shops. But there's only one mosque. And so I asked Jawad, \"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community. Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?\" He said, \"Long story. It was hard, it was a difficult road, but ultimately the leaders of the community came together, realizing we only have each other. And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams, and those imams would take turns, they would rotate who would say Friday prayer. But the whole community, all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni, would sit together and pray.\"We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. We face huge issues as a world \u2014 the financial crisis, global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness. And every day we have a choice. We can take the easier road, the more cynical road, which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was, a fear of each other, distancing and blame. Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation, transcendence, compassion and love, but also accountability and justice.I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles, who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges, the first child to desegregate schools in the South \u2014 in this case, New Orleans. And he said that every day this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress, would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily, calling her a monster, threatening to poison her \u2014 distorted faces. And every day he would watch her, and it looked like she was talking to the people. And he would say, \"Ruby, what are you saying?\" And she'd say, \"I'm not talking.\" And finally he said, \"Ruby, I see that you're talking. What are you saying?\" And she said, \"Dr. Coles, I am not talking; I'm praying.\" And he said, \"Well, what are you praying?\" And she said, \"I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.'\" At age six, this child was living a life of immersion, and her family paid a price for it. But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education.My final story is about a young, beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga, who was another Acumen Fund fellow, who hails from Uganda, a farming community. And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya, just 200 miles away. And he said to me at the end of his year, \"Jacqueline, it was so humbling, because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. But especially when I was talking to the African women, I sometimes made these mistakes \u2014 it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.\" And he said, \"So I conclude that, in many ways, leadership is like a panicle of rice. Because at the height of the season, at the height of its powers, it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world, it reaches to the heavens.\" And he said, \"But right before the harvest, it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came.\"We need leaders. We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can, ourselves, extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man, woman and child on this planet. And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. Robert Kennedy once said that \"few of us have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.\" And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. Our lives are so short, and our time on this planet is so precious, and all we have is each other. So may each of you live lives of immersion. They won't necessarily be easy lives, but in the end, it is all that will sustain us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1076, "subtitle":

days,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\ntalking to groups of students and professionals,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nand everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nOn the one hand, people say,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\n\"The time for change is now.\"\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nThey want to be part of it.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nThey talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nBut on the other hand,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI hear people talking about fear,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\na sense of risk-aversion.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nThey say, \"I really want to follow a life of purpose,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nbut I don't know where to start.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nI don't want to disappoint my family or friends.\"\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nI work in global poverty.\n\n00:00:45.958 -->

marginalized?\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nWill I not make enough money?\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nWill I never get married or have children?\"\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nAnd as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older --\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand I'm glad I waited --\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\n-- and has no children,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nI look at these young people\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand I say, \"Your job is not to be perfect.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nYour job is only to be human.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd nothing important happens in life\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nwithout a cost.\"\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThese conversations really reflect what's happening\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nat the national and international level.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nOur leaders and ourselves\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwant everything,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbut we don't talk about the costs.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWe don't talk about the sacrifice.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nOne of my favorite quotes from literature\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nwas written by Tillie Olsen,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nthe great American writer from the South.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nIn a short story called \"Oh Yes,\"\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nshe talks about a white woman in the 1950s\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwho has a daughter\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwho befriends a little African American girl,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand she looks at her child with a sense of pride,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nbut she also wonders,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwhat price will she pay?\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\n\"Better immersion\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthan to live untouched.\"\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nBut the real question is,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nwhat is the cost of not daring?\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat is the cost of not trying?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nI've been so privileged in my life\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto know extraordinary leaders\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nwho have chosen to live lives of immersion.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nOne woman I knew who was a fellow\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nat a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwas named Ingrid Washinawatok.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nShe was a leader of the Menominee tribe,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\na Native American peoples.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nAnd when we would gather as fellows,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nshe would push us to think about\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nhow the elders in Native American culture\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nmake decisions.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd she said they would literally visualize\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthe faces of children\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nfor seven generations into the future,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nlooking at them from the Earth,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand they would look at them, holding them as stewards\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nfor that future.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nIngrid understood that we are connected to each other,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nnot only as human beings,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut to every living thing on the planet.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd tragically, in 1999,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwhen she was in Colombia\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nworking with the U'wa people,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nfocused on preserving their culture and language,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nshe and two colleagues were abducted\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nand tortured and killed by the FARC.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd whenever we would gather the fellows after that,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nwe would leave a chair empty for her spirit.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd more than a decade later,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwhen I talk to NGO fellows,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwhether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand we talk about Ingrid,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nthey all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand her spirit\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand really build on the unfulfilled work\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nof her life's mission.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd when we think about legacy,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI can think of no more powerful one,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\ndespite how short her life was.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd I've been touched by Cambodian women --\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbeautiful women,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwomen who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd I met them in the early '90s.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIn the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthe Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthe artists, the dancers.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd at the end of the war,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nthere were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd the women, who I was so privileged to meet\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nwhen there were three survivors,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\ntold these stories about lying in their cots\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nin the refugee camps.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThey said they would try so hard\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nto remember the fragments of the dance,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nhoping that others were alive and doing the same.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nher hands at her side,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand she talked about\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthe reunion of the 30 after the war\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand how extraordinary it was.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd these big tears fell down her face,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nbut she never lifted her hands to move them.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd the women decided that they would train\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nnot the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nbut the next generation.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd I sat there in the studio\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwatching these women clapping their hands --\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nbeautiful rhythms --\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nas these little fairy pixies\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwere dancing around them,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwearing these beautiful silk colors.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd I thought, after all this atrocity,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthis is how human beings really pray.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nBecause they're focused on honoring\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nwhat is most beautiful about our past\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand building it into\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthe promise of our future.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd what these women understood\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nis sometimes the most important things that we do\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand that we spend our time on\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nare those things that we cannot measure.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nI also have been touched\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nby the dark side of power and leadership.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd I have learned that power,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nparticularly in its absolute form,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nis an equal opportunity provider.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIn 1986, I moved to Rwanda,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto start that country's first microfinance bank.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd one of the women was Agnes --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nthere on your extreme left --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nshe was one of the first three\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nwomen parliamentarians in Rwanda,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand her legacy should have been\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nto be one of the mothers of Rwanda.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe built this institution based on social justice,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\ngender equity,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthis idea of empowering women.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nBut Agnes cared more about the trappings of power\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthan she did principle at the end.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd though she had been part of building a liberal party,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\na political party\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat was focused on diversity and tolerance,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nabout three months before the genocide, she switched parties\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand she became the Minister of Justice\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nunder the genocide regime\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nand was known for inciting men to kill faster\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand stop behaving like women.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nShe was convicted\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nof category one crimes of genocide.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd I would visit her in the prisons,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nsitting side-by-side, knees touching,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand I would have to admit to myself\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthat monsters exist in all of us,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbut that maybe it's not monsters so much,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nbut the broken parts of ourselves,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nsadnesses, secret shame,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand that ultimately it's easy for demagogues\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nto prey on those parts,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthose fragments, if you will,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand to make us look at other beings, human beings,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nas lesser than ourselves --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand in the extreme, to do terrible things.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd there is no group\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmore vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nthan young men.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nI've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nis the adolescent male.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd so in a gathering\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwhere we're focused on women,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhile it is so critical that we invest in our girls\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand we even the playing field\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand we find ways to honor them,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwe have to remember that the girls and the women\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nare most isolated and violated\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nand victimized and made invisible\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nin those very societies\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhere our men and our boys\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nfeel disempowered,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nunable to provide.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd that, when they sit on those street corners\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand all they can think of in the future\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis no job, no education,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nno possibility,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwell then it's easy to understand\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nhow the greatest source of status\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\ncan come from a uniform\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nand a gun.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nSometimes very small investments\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\ncan release enormous, infinite potential\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthat exists in all of us.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nOne of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nSuraj Sudhakar,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas what we call moral imagination --\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthe ability to put yourself in another person's shoes\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand lead from that perspective.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd he's been working with this young group of men\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwho come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd they're incredible guys.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd together they started a book club\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nfor a hundred people in the slums,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand they're reading many TED authors and liking it.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd then they created a business plan competition.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThen they decided that they would do TEDx's.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd I have learned so much\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nfrom Chris and Kevin\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand Alex and Herbert\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand all of these young men.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAlex, in some ways, said it best.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nHe said, \"We used to feel like nobodies,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbut now we feel like somebodies.\"\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAnd I think we have it all wrong\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhen we think that income is the link.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhat we really yearn for as human beings\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nis to be visible to each other.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd the reason these young guys\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ntold me that they're doing these TEDx's\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nis because they were sick and tired\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nof the only workshops coming to the slums\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nbeing those workshops focused on HIV,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nor at best, microfinance.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnd they wanted to celebrate\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwhat's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare --\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthe photojournalists and the creatives,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthe graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd they're doing it.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nAnd my hat's off to you in Kibera.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nMy own work focuses\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\non making philanthropy more effective\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand capitalism more inclusive.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAt Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand we invest what we call patient capital --\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nmoney that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nnot as passive recipients of charity,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nbut as full-bodied agents of change\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nwho want to solve their own problems\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand make their own decisions.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWe leave our money for 10 to 15 years,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand when we get it back, we invest in other innovations\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nthat focus on change.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nI know it works.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWe've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand those companies have brought another 200 million dollars\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\ninto these forgotten markets.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThis year alone, they've delivered 40 million services\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nlike maternal health care and housing,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nemergency services, solar energy,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nso that people can have more dignity\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nin solving their problems.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nPatient capital is uncomfortable\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nfor people searching for simple solutions,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\neasy categories,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbecause we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut we find those entrepreneurs\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nwho put people and the planet\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nbefore profit.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd ultimately, we want to be part of a movement\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthat is about measuring impact,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nmeasuring what is most important to us.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd my dream is we'll have a world one day\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhere we don't just honor those who take money\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand make more money from it,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nbut we find those individuals who take our resources\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nand convert it into changing the world\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nin the most positive ways.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd it's only when we honor them\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand celebrate them and give them status\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthat the world will really change.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nLast May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwhere I saw two visions of the world\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nliving side-by-side --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\none based on violence\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand the other on transcendence.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nI happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\non the day that two mosques were attacked\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nby suicide bombers.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd the reason these mosques were attacked\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nis because the people praying inside\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwere from a particular sect of Islam\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwho fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd not only did those suicide bombers\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\ntake a hundred lives,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nbut they did more,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nbecause they created more hatred, more rage, more fear\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand certainly despair.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nBut less than 24 hours,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI was 13 miles away from those mosques,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nvisiting one of our Acumen investees,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nan incredible man, Jawad Aslam,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwho dares to live a life of immersion.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nBorn and raised in Baltimore,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nhe studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nFor two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nbut he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nnamed Tasneem Saddiqui.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd he had a dream that he would build a housing community\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\non this barren piece of land\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nusing patient capital,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut he continued to pay a price.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nHe stood on moral ground\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand refused to pay bribes.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nIt took almost two years just to register the land.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBut I saw how the level of moral standard can rise\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nfrom one person's action.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nToday, 2,000 people live in 300 houses\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nin this beautiful community.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd there's schools and clinics and shops.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nBut there's only one mosque.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd so I asked Jawad,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\n\"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWho gets to use the mosque on Fridays?\"\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nHe said, \"Long story.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nIt was hard, it was a difficult road,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nbut ultimately the leaders of the community came together,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nrealizing we only have each other.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd we decided that we would elect\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthe three most respected imams,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nand those imams would take turns,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nthey would rotate who would say Friday prayer.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nBut the whole community,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nall the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwould sit together and pray.\"\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nWe need that kind of moral leadership and courage\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nin our worlds.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nWe face huge issues as a world --\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthe financial crisis,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nglobal warming\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand this growing sense of fear and otherness.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAnd every day we have a choice.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nWe can take the easier road,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthe more cynical road,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwhich is a road based on\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nsometimes dreams of a past that never really was,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\na fear of each other,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\ndistancing and blame.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nOr we can take the much more difficult path\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nof transformation, transcendence,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\ncompassion and love,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nbut also accountability and justice.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nI had the great honor\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nof working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwho stood up for change\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nduring the Civil Rights movement in the United States.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nAnd he tells this incredible story\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nabout working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nthe first child to desegregate schools in the South --\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nin this case, New Orleans.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd he said that every day\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthis six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwould walk with real grace\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthrough a phalanx of white people\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nscreaming angrily, calling her a monster,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthreatening to poison her --\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\ndistorted faces.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd every day he would watch her,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand it looked like she was talking to the people.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAnd he would say, \"Ruby, what are you saying?\"\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd she'd say, \"I'm not talking.\"\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd finally he said, \"Ruby, I see that you're talking.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nWhat are you saying?\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd she said, \"Dr. Coles, I am not talking;\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nI'm praying.\"\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd he said, \"Well, what are you praying?\"\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAnd she said, \"I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nfor they know not what they are doing.'\"\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAt age six,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthis child was living a life of immersion,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nand her family paid a price for it.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut she became part of history\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand opened up this idea\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nthat all of us should have access to education.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nMy final story is about a young, beautiful man\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nnamed Josephat Byaruhanga,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwho was another Acumen Fund fellow,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nwho hails from Uganda, a farming community.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nAnd we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\njust 200 miles away.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nAnd he said to me at the end of his year,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n\"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nbecause I thought as a farmer and as an African\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nI would understand how to transcend culture.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nBut especially when I was talking to the African women,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nI sometimes made these mistakes --\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nit was so hard for me to learn how to listen.\"\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nAnd he said, \"So I conclude that, in many ways,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nleadership is like a panicle of rice.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nBecause at the height of the season,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nat the height of its powers,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nit's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nit reaches to the heavens.\"\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd he said, \"But right before the harvest,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nit bends over\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nwith great gratitude and humility\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nto touch the earth from where it came.\"\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nWe need leaders.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nWe ourselves need to lead\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nfrom a place that has the audacity\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nto believe we can, ourselves,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nextend the fundamental assumption\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nthat all men are created equal\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nto every man, woman and child on this planet.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd we need to have the humility to recognize\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nthat we cannot do it alone.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nRobert Kennedy once said\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nthat \"few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nbut each of us can work\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nto change a small portion of events.\"\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nAnd it is in the total of all those acts\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nthat the history of this generation will be written.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nOur lives are so short,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand our time on this planet\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nis so precious,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand all we have is each other.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nSo may each of you\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nlive lives of immersion.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nThey won't necessarily be easy lives,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nbut in the end, it is all that will sustain us.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:35.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The future of business is the \"mesh\"", "duration": "887", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lisa_gansky_the_future_of_business_is_the_mesh", "transcript": "I'm speaking to you about what I call the \"mesh.\" It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives. And it's starting to look at \u2014 not always and not for everything \u2014 but in certain moments of time, access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them. And so it's the pursuit of better things, easily shared. And we come from a long tradition of sharing. We've shared transportation. We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam. We've also shared other sorts of entertainment \u2014 sports arenas, public parks, concert halls, libraries, universities. All these things are share-platforms, but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the \"mother of all share-platforms.\"And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. One is the recession \u2014 that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value \u2014 so starting to align the value with the true cost. Secondly, population growth and density into cities. More people, smaller spaces, less stuff. Climate change: we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet. Also, there's been this recent distrust of big brands, global big brands, in a bunch of different industries, and that's created an opening. Research is showing here, in the States, and in Canada and Western Europe, that most of us are much more open to local companies, or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. Whereas before, we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted. And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before \u2014 except for if you're sitting next to someone.(Laughter)The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades, and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way. It's also \u2014 Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems, and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways.And so for me, a mesh company, the \"classic\" mesh company, brings together these three things: our ability to connect to each other \u2014 most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled \u2014 allows us to find each other and find things in time and space. And third is that physical things are readable on a map \u2014 so restaurants, a variety of venues, but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that, we can also track things that are moving, like a car, a taxicab, a transit system, a box that's moving through time and space. And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them.For example, I want to use Zipcar. How many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing? Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you. Basically Zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world. They did not invent car-sharing. Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe. One of the founders went to Switzerland, saw it implemented someplace, said, \"Wow, that looks really cool. I think we can do that in Cambridge,\" brought it to Cambridge and they started \u2014 two women \u2014 Robin Chase being the other person who started it. Zipcar got some really important things right. First, they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir. And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing. They made it sexy. They made it fresh. They made it aspirational. If you were a member of the club, when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster. The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars that were hollowed out or something. They picked these sexy cars. They targeted to universities. They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. It was a very nice experience, and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right. But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. They understand that they are an information company. Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow \u2014 usually as quickly as possible. But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service, you might use an E.V. to commute, you get a truck because you're doing a home project. When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan. And you're going to the mountains to ski, you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing. Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back, collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service. And so it's not only an option for them, but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us, to be like a concierge service. Because we give them so much information, and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving. They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next.And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car? What percentage of the time? Any guesses? Those are really very good. I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started. The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent. And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent, 90 percent of the time, something that costs us a lot of money \u2014 personally, and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things \u2014 90 percent of the time it's sitting around. So for this reason, I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that, if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away, there's a lot of value in those things. What set up with Zipcar \u2014 Zipcar started in 2000.In the last year, 2010, two car companies started, one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar, and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S. They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks of where you stand. Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car, and it's probably also available. So people have created this business. Zipcar started a decade earlier, in 2000. It took them six years to get 1,000 cars in service. WhipCar, which started April of last year, it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service. So, really interesting. People are making anywhere between 200 and 700 dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it. So it's like vacation rentals for cars. Since I'm here \u2014 and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things \u2014 we saw cable-ready TVs and WiFi-ready Notebooks \u2014 it would be really great if, any minute now, you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off. Because it just creates more flexibility. It allows us as owners to have other options. And I think we're going there anyway.The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses \u2014 and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses, or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies, car manufacturers, who are beginning to offer their own car-share services as well as a second flanker brand, or as really a test, I think \u2014 is to make sharing irresistible. We have experiences in our lives, certainly, when sharing has been irresistible. It's just, how do we make that recurrent and scale it? We know also, because we're connected in social networks, that it's easy to create delight in one little place. It's contagious because we're all connected to each other. So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels. The opposite, as we know, is also true, often more true.So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A., doing the things that gourmet food trucks do, and they've gathered quite a following. In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur, I look at things as platforms. Platforms are invitations. So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network, there are all these networks \u2014 Facebook as well. These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience. And honestly, it's full of surprises. Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook, for example, two years ago, when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform.So in this way, I think that cities are platforms, and certainly Detroit is a platform. The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs \u2014 it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. It's inviting participation, and cities have, historically, invited all sorts of participation. Now we're saying that there's other options as well. So, for example, city departments can open up transit data. Google has made available transit data API. And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S. that have provided the transit data, and different developers are building applications. So I was having a coffee in Portland, and half-of-a-latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in 16 minutes. And so it's reliable, real data that's right in my face, where I am, so I can finish the latte.There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now: about 21 percent of vacant commercial and industrial space. That space is not vital. The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. There's this thing \u2014 how many people here have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops? Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this. And this is a very mesh-y thing. Essentially, there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live. There's a pop-up general store every three weeks, and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. Subsequent to that, after it's been going for about a year now, they actually started to lease and create and extend. An area that was edgy-artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people. So this is an example. The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts, and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London. But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do is create perishability and urgency. It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson: sold out. And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing.So a lot of what we see in the mesh, and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define, refine and scale. It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur, to go to market, to be in conversation with people, listen, refine something and go back. It's very cost-effective, and it's very mesh-y. The infrastructure enables that.In closing, and as we're moving towards the end, I just also want to encourage \u2014 and I'm willing to share my failures as well, though not from the stage. (Laughter) I would just like to say that one of the big things, when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other, but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation, is by sharing failures. And one quick example is Velib, in 2007, came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition, a very big bike-sharing service. They made a lot of mistakes. They had some number of big successes. But they were very transparent, or they had to be, in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work. And so B.C. in Barcelona and B-cycle and Boris Bikes in London \u2014 no one has had to repeat the version 1.0 screw-ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes.We're at the very beginning of something that, what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward, is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early. I have a website \u2014 it's a directory \u2014 and it started with about 1,200 companies, and in the last two-and-a-half months it's up to about 3,300 companies. And it grows on a very regular daily basis. But it's very much at the beginning.So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. And thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1077, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI'm speaking to you about what I call the

00:02:37.958\nthat allows us to get from point A to point B\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand move things that way.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nIt's also -- Web and mobile\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nallow us to be connected\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand create all kinds of platforms and systems,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand the investment of those technologies\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand that infrastructure\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nis really our inheritance.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nIt allows us to engage\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nin really new and interesting ways.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd so for me, a mesh company, the \"classic\" mesh company,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nbrings together these three things:\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nour ability to connect to each other --\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nmost of us are walking around with these mobile devices\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nthat are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled --\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nallows us to find each other\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand find things in time and space.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd third is that physical things\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nare readable on a map --\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nso restaurants, a variety of venues,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nbut also with GPS and other technology\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nlike RFID\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand it continues to expand beyond that,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nwe can also track things that are moving,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nlike a car, a taxicab, a transit system,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\na box that's moving through time and space.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd so that sets up\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nfor making access to get goods and services\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nmore convenient and less costly in many cases\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthan owning them.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nFor example, I want to use Zipcar.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nHow many people here have experienced\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\ncar-sharing or bike-sharing?\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nWow, that's great. Okay, thank you.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nBasically Zipcar\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nis the largest car-sharing company in the world.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThey did not invent car-sharing.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nCar-sharing was actually invented in Europe.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nOne of the founders went to Switzerland,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nsaw it implemented someplace,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nsaid, \"Wow, that looks really cool.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI think we can do that in Cambridge,\"\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nbrought it to Cambridge\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand they started -- two women --\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nRobin Chase being the other person who started it.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nZipcar got some really important things right.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nFirst, they really understood\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthat a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd so they were very clever\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nabout the way that they packaged car-sharing.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThey made it sexy. They made it fresh.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey made it aspirational.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nIf you were a member of the club,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhen you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThe cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat were hollowed out or something.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThey picked these sexy cars.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThey targeted to universities.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThey made sure that the demographic\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nfor who they were targeting and the car was all matching.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIt was a very nice experience,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nBut they understood fundamentally\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthat they are not a car company.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nThey understand that they are an information company.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nBecause when we buy a car\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwe go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow --\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nusually as quickly as possible.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nBut when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nyou might use an E.V. to commute,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nyou get a truck because you're doing a home project.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nWhen you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd you're going to the mountains to ski,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nyou get different accessories put on the car\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nfor doing that sort of thing.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nMeanwhile, these guys are sitting back,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\ncollecting all sorts of data\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nabout our behavior and how we interact with the service.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd so it's not only an option for them,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut I believe it's an imperative\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nfor Zipcar and other mesh companies\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nto actually just wow us,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nto be like a concierge service.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBecause we give them so much information,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand they are entitled to really see\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nhow it is that we're moving.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThey're in really good shape to anticipate\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhat we're going to want next.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd so what percent of the day\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ndo you think the average person uses a car?\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nWhat percentage of the time?\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAny guesses?\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThose are really very good.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI was imagining it was like\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n20 percent when I first started.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nThe number across the U.S. and Western Europe\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nis eight percent.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\n90 percent of the time,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nsomething that costs us a lot of money --\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\npersonally, and also we organize our cities around it\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand all sorts of things --\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\n90 percent of the time it's sitting around.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo for this reason,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nI think one of the other themes with the mesh\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nis essentially that, if we squeeze hard\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\non things that we've thrown away,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthere's a lot of value in those things.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nWhat set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIn the last year, 2010,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\ntwo car companies started,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\none that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThey're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nbecause the two things that really work for car-sharing\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nis, one, the car has to be available,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand two, it's within one or two blocks\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof where you stand.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nWell the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nis probably your neighbor's car,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand it's probably also available.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo people have created this business.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nZipcar started a decade earlier,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nin 2000.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nIt took them six years\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nto get 1,000 cars in service.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWhipCar, which started April of last year,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nit took them six months\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nto get 1,000 cars in the service.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo, really interesting.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nPeople are making anywhere between\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\n200 and 700 dollars a month\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nletting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nSo it's like vacation rentals for cars.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSince I'm here --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand I hope some people in the audience\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nare in the car business --\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\n-- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwe saw cable-ready TVs\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand WiFi-ready Notebooks --\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nit would be really great if, any minute now,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nyou guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nBecause it just creates more flexibility.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nIt allows us as owners to have other options.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd I think we're going there anyway.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThe opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses --\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthat are full mesh businesses,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nor other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\ncar manufacturers,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nwho are beginning to offer\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ntheir own car-share services\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nas well as a second flanker brand,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nor as really a test, I think --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nis to make sharing irresistible.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWe have experiences in our lives, certainly,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nwhen sharing has been irresistible.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIt's just, how do we make that recurrent\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand scale it?\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nWe know also, because we're connected in social networks,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthat it's easy to create delight\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nin one little place.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nIt's contagious because we're all connected to each other.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo if I have a terrific experience\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThe opposite, as we know, is also true,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\noften more true.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ndoing the things that gourmet food trucks do,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand they've gathered quite a following.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nIn general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI look at things as platforms.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nPlatforms are invitations.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nSo creating Craigslist\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nor iTunes and the iPhone developer network,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthere are all these networks -- Facebook as well.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nThese platforms invite all sorts of developers\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand all sorts of people\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nto come with their ideas and their opportunity\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nto create and target an application\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nfor a particular audience.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd honestly, it's full of surprises.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBecause I don't think any of us in this room\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ncould have predicted the sorts of applications\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthat have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nfor example, two years ago,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nwhen Mark announced\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nthat they were going to go with a platform.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nSo in this way, I think that cities are platforms,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand certainly Detroit is a platform.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThe invitation of bringing\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nmakers and artists and entrepreneurs --\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nit really helps stimulate this fiery creativity\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand helps a city to thrive.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nIt's inviting participation,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nand cities have, historically,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\ninvited all sorts of participation.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nNow we're saying that there's other options as well.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nSo, for example, city departments\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ncan open up transit data.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nGoogle has made available transit data API.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat have provided the transit data,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand different developers are building applications.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nSo I was having a coffee in Portland,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand half-of-a-latte in\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand the little board in the cafe\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nall of a sudden starts showing me\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nthat the next bus is coming in three minutes\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand the train is coming in 16 minutes.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd so it's reliable, real data\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthat's right in my face, where I am,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nso I can finish the latte.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThere's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nabout 21 percent\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nof vacant commercial and industrial space.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThat space is not vital.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nThe areas around it lack vitality\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand vibrancy and engagement.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThere's this thing -- how many people here\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nhave heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nOh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd this is a very mesh-y thing.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nEssentially, there are all sorts\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nof restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThere's a pop-up general store every three weeks,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand they do a fantastic job\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nof making a very social event\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nhappening for foodies.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSuper fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSubsequent to that,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nafter it's been going for about a year now,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthey actually started to lease and create and extend.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAn area that was edgy-artsy\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nis now starting to become much cooler\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand engage a lot more people.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo this is an example.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nThe Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBut these sorts of things are happening\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nin many different environments.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nFrom my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nis create perishability and urgency.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nIt creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nsold out.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd the opportunity to really focus trust and attention\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nis a wonderful thing.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo a lot of what we see in the mesh,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand a lot of what we have in the platform that we built\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nallows us to define, refine and scale.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIt allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nto go to market,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nto be in conversation with people,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nlisten, refine something and go back.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nIt's very cost-effective,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand it's very mesh-y.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThe infrastructure enables that.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nIn closing, and as we're moving towards the end,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nI just also want to encourage --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nand I'm willing to share my failures as well,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthough not from the stage.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI would just like to say that one of the big things,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwhen we look at waste\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand when we look at ways that we can really be generous\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand contribute to each other,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nbut also move to create a better economic situation\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand a better environmental situation,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nis by sharing failures.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd one quick example\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nis Velib, in 2007,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\ncame forward in Paris\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nwith a very bold proposition,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\na very big bike-sharing service.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nThey made a lot of mistakes.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThey had some number of big successes.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nBut they were very transparent, or they had to be,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin the way that they exposed\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwhat worked and didn't work.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd so B.C. in Barcelona\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand B-cycle\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand Boris Bikes in London --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nno one has had to repeat\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nthe version 1.0 screw-ups\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand expensive learning exercises\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat happened in Paris.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nSo the opportunity when we're connected\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nis also to share failures and successes.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nWe're at the very beginning of something\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthat, what we're seeing\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand the way that mesh companies are coming forward,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nis inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nI have a website -- it's a directory --\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand it started with about 1,200 companies,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand in the last two-and-a-half months\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nit's up to about 3,300 companies.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd it grows on a very regular daily basis.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nBut it's very much at the beginning.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd thank you very much.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "On being a woman and a diplomat", "duration": "779", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/madeleine_albright_on_being_a_woman_and_a_diplomat", "transcript": "Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?Madeleine Albright: This is \"Breaking the Glass Ceiling.\"PM: Oh. That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen. And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein. I'll tell you what happened. I went to the United Nations as an ambassador, and it was after the Gulf War, and I was an instructed ambassador. And the cease-fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions, and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly, which he deserved \u2014 he had invaded another country. And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things, but among them an \"unparalleled serpent.\" And so I happened to have a snake pin. So I wore it when we talked about Iraq. (Laughter) And when I went out to meet the press, they zeroed in, said, \"Why are you wearing that snake pin?\" I said, \"Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.\" And then I thought, well this is fun. So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would, in fact, reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day. So that's how it all started.PM: So how large is the collection?MA: Pretty big. It's now traveling. At the moment it's in Indianapolis, but it was at the Smithsonian. And it goes with a book that says, \"Read My Pins.\"(Laughter)PM: So is this a good idea. I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State, and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing, how you looked \u2014 the thing that happens to a lot of women, especially if they're the first in a position. So how do you feel about that \u2014 the whole \u2014MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. What was interesting was that, before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador, I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me, and she said, \"You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. Go out and look like a diplomat.\" So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. But still, there were all kinds of questions about \u2014 \"did you wear a hat?\" \"How short was your skirt?\" And one of the things \u2014 if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots, and she got criticized over that. And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.PM: It is, for all of us, men and women, finding our ways of defining our roles, and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ... and so how did you handle that?MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. And I said, \"Well I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.\" So it evolved. (Laughter) But basically I love being a woman. And so what happened \u2014 and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this \u2014 I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N., and that's when this all started, because that is a very male organization. And I'm sitting there \u2014 there are 15 members of the Security Council \u2014 so 14 men sat there staring at me, and I thought \u2014 well you know how we all are. You want to get the feeling of the room, and \"do people like me?\" and \"will I really say something intelligent?\" And all of a sudden I thought, \"Well, wait a minute. I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard,\" and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal, reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country. And so that happened more at various times, but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. I think we are a lot better at personal relationships, and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter, when she turned seven last year, said to her mother, my daughter, \"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State? Only girls are Secretary of State.\"(Laughter)(Applause)PM: Because in her lifetime \u2014 MA: That would be so.PM: What a change that is. As you travel now all over the world, which you do frequently, how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls? Where are we?MA: I think we're slowly changing, but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different. And therefore it means that we have to remember that, while many of us have had huge opportunities \u2014 and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field \u2014 is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. And so what I have felt \u2014 and I have looked at this from a national security issue \u2014 when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity. So I think that it behooves us \u2014 those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice \u2014 that we need to help other women. And I really dedicated myself to that, both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.PM: And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?MA: From some people. I think that they thought that it was a soft issue. The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues, because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects, and because, as I said, it is really central to the way that we think about things. Now for instance, some of the wars that took place when I was in office, a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it. For instance, when I started, there were wars in the Balkans. The women in Bosnia were being raped. We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues. And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage was, I had just arrived at the U.N., and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N. Now there are 192. But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. So I said to my assistant, \"Invite the other women permanent representatives.\" And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there. I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183. So the countries that had women representatives were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica, Lichtenstein and me. So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus. (Laughter) And so we set it up, and we called ourselves the G7.(Laughter)PM: Is that \"Girl 7?\" MA: Girl 7.And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war, that it was against humanity.(Applause)PM: So when you look around the world and you see that, in many cases \u2014 certainly in the Western world \u2014 women are evolving into more leadership positions, and even other places some barriers are being brought down, but there's still so much violence, still so many problems, and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't, when there was maybe you \u2014 one voice, maybe one or two others. Do you believe, and can you tell us why, there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis?MA: Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that, you've forgotten high school. (Laughter) But the bottom line is that there is a way, when there are more women at the table, that there's an attempt to develop some understanding. So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi, we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda. And so I think the capability of women to put themselves \u2014 I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy. I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room.When I was Secretary of State, there were only 13 other women foreign ministers. And so it was nice when one of them would show up. For instance, she is now the president of Finland, but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union. And it was really terrific. Because one of the things I think you'll understand. We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, \"Well I feel we should do something about this,\" and they'd say, \"What do you mean, you feel?\" And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me. And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control, and she said, \"Well I feel we should do this.\" And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. The other thing that I think is really important: A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy, but it's about budgets, military budgets, and how the debts of countries work out. So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts, they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.PM: So how do we get this balance we're looking for, then, in the world? More women's voices at the table? More men who believe that the balance is best?MA: Well I think one of the things \u2014 I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office, to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices. I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about, because I am of a certain age where, when I started in my career, believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me: \"Why aren't you in the carpool line?\" or \"Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time?\" And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. In fact, I think \"guilt\" is every woman's middle name. And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.(Applause)PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.

But that's the least of it.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nPM: It is, for all of us, men and women,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nfinding our ways of defining our roles,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand doing them in ways that make a difference in the world\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nand shape the future.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nHow did you handle that balance\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nbetween being the tough diplomatic\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nand strong voice of this country\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nto the rest of the world\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nand also how you felt about yourself\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nas a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand so how did you handle that?\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nMA: Well the interesting part was I was asked\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nwhat it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\na few minutes after I'd been named.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd I said, \"Well I've been a woman for 60 years,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.\"\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSo it evolved.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nBut basically I love being a woman.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd so what happened --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand I think there will probably be some people in the audience\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthat will identify with this --\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nI went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand that's when this all started,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nbecause that is a very male organization.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nso 14 men sat there staring at me,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand I thought -- well you know how we all are.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nYou want to get the feeling of the room,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand \"do people like me?\"\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand \"will I really say something intelligent?\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd all of a sudden I thought, \"Well, wait a minute.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nI am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand if I don't speak today\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthen the voice of the United States will not be heard,\"\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand it was the first time that I had that feeling\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthat I had to step out of myself\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nin my normal, reluctant female mode\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd so that happened more at various times,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nbut I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto being a woman.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nI think we are a lot better\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nat personal relationships,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand then have the capability obviously\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nof telling it like it is when it's necessary.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nBut I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nwhen she turned seven last year,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nsaid to her mother, my daughter,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\n\"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nOnly girls are Secretary of State.\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nPM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nPM: What a change that is.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAs you travel now all over the world,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich you do frequently,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nhow do you assess\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthis global narrative around the story of women and girls?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nWhere are we?\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nMA: I think we're slowly changing,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nbut obviously there are whole pockets\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nin countries where nothing is different.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd therefore it means that we have to remember\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat, while many of us have had huge opportunities --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nis that there are a lot of women\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat are not capable\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nof worrying and taking care of themselves\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand understanding that women have to help other women.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAnd so what I have felt --\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand I have looked at this\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nfrom a national security issue --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwhen I was Secretary of State, I decided\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nnot just because I'm a feminist,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nbut because I believe that societies are better off\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwhen women are politically and economically empowered,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat values are passed down,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthe health situation is better,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\neducation is better,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthere is greater economic prosperity.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo I think that it behooves us --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthose of us that live in various countries\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhere we do have economic and political voice --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat we need to help other women.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd I really dedicated myself to that,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nboth at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nPM: And did you get pushback\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfrom making that a central tenant of foreign policy?\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nMA: From some people.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nI think that they thought that it was a soft issue.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThe bottom line that I decided\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nwas actually women's issues are the hardest issues,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nbecause they are the ones that have to do with life and death\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nin so many aspects,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand because, as I said,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nit is really central to the way that we think about things.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nNow for instance,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nsome of the wars that took place\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwhen I was in office,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\na lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nFor instance, when I started,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthere were wars in the Balkans.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThe women in Bosnia were being raped.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nto deal specifically with those kinds of issues.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwas, I had just arrived at the U.N.,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nNow there are 192.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBut it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo I said to my assistant,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\n\"Invite the other women permanent representatives.\"\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd I thought when I'd get to my apartment\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nthat there'd be a lot of women there.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nI get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo the countries that had women representatives\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwere Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nTrinidad Tobago, Jamaica,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nLichtenstein and me.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSo being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd so we set it up,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand we called ourselves the G7.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nPM: Is that \"Girl 7?\" MA: Girl 7.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd we lobbied\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\non behalf of women's issues.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo we managed to get two women judges\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\non this war crimes tribunal.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd then what happened\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwas that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthat it was against humanity.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nPM: So when you look around the world\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand you see that, in many cases --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\ncertainly in the Western world --\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwomen are evolving into more leadership positions,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand even other places\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsome barriers are being brought down,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbut there's still so much violence,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nstill so many problems,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand yet we hear there are more women\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nat the negotiating tables.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nNow you were at those negotiating tables\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwhen they weren't, when there was maybe you --\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\none voice, maybe one or two others.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nDo you believe, and can you tell us why,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthere is going to be a significant shift\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nin things like violence\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand peace and conflict and resolution\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\non a sustainable basis?\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nMA: Well I do think, when there are more women,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nthat the tone of the conversation changes,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand also the goals of the conversation change.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nBut it doesn't mean that the whole world\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nwould be a lot better\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nif it were totally run by women.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIf you think that, you've forgotten high school.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nBut the bottom line\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nis that there is a way,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhen there are more women at the table,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthat there's an attempt\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nto develop some understanding.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nwe'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nto talk about some of the problems\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthat had taken place in Rwanda.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd so I think the capability of women\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto put themselves --\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nI think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand having more empathy.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nI think it helps in terms of the support\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nif there are other women in the room.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nWhen I was Secretary of State,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthere were only 13 other women foreign ministers.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd so it was nice when one of them would show up.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nFor instance, she is now the president of Finland,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nbut Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd it was really terrific.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBecause one of the things I think you'll understand.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nWe went to a meeting,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand the men in my delegation,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nwhen I would say, \"Well I feel we should do something about this,\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand they'd say, \"What do you mean, you feel?\"\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nAnd so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nAnd all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand she said, \"Well I feel we should do this.\"\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nBut I think it really does help\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nto have a critical mass of women\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nin a series of foreign policy positions.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe other thing that I think is really important:\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nA lot of national security policy\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nisn't just about foreign policy,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbut it's about budgets, military budgets,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand how the debts of countries work out.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo if you have women\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nin a variety of foreign policy posts,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthey can support each other\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwhen there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nPM: So how do we get\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthis balance we're looking for, then, in the world?\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nMore women's voices at the table?\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nMore men who believe\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nthat the balance is best?\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nMA: Well I think one of the things --\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nI'm chairman of the board of an organization\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\ncalled the National Democratic Institute\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat works to support women candidates.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI think that we need\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nto help in other countries\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nto train women\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nto be in political office,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nto figure out how they can in fact\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\ndevelop political voices.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nI think we also need to be supportive\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwhen businesses are being created\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand just make sure that women help each other.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nNow I have a saying\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nthat I feel very strongly about,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nbecause I am of a certain age\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwhere, when I started in my career,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nbelieve it or not, there were other women who criticized me:\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\n\"Why aren't you in the carpool line?\"\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nor \"Aren't your children suffering\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nbecause you're not there all the time?\"\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nAnd I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nIn fact, I think \"guilt\" is every woman's middle name.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd so I think what needs to happen\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nis we need to help each other.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd my motto is that there's a special place in hell\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nfor women who don't help each other.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nPM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nMA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to use experts -- and when not to", "duration": "1098", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/noreena_hertz_how_to_use_experts_and_when_not_to", "transcript": "It's Monday morning. In Washington, the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office, assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen. At Number 10 Downing Street, David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession. In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door, listening to her baby crying and crying, trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it. And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital, trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said, \"You must make him drink today,\" \u2014 my father's been nil by mouth for a week \u2014 or whether, by giving him this bottle, I might actually kill him.We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives, and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions. We talk things over with our friends, we scour the Internet, we search through books. But still, even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends, it's still experts that we rely upon most \u2014 especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity, we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can \u2014 that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do.But I believe that this is a big problem, a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society, as a culture and as individuals. It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world \u2014 of course they have. The problem lies with us: we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty, their assuredness, their definitiveness, and in the process, we have ceded our responsibility, substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom. We've surrendered our power, trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. This is no exaggeration. In a recent experiment, a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak. The results were quite extraordinary. As they listened to the experts' voices, the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off. It literally flat-lined. And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice, however right or wrong.But experts do get things wrong. Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10? Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself, you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you? And then there's, of course, the example that we're all too aware of: financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the 1930s. For the sake of our health, our wealth and our collective security, it's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on. And I'm saying this as an economist who, over the past few years, has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why, but also \u2014 and I'm aware of the irony here \u2014 as an expert myself, as a professor, as somebody who advises prime ministers, heads of big companies, international organizations, but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change, that we need to become more open-minded, more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from, let me bring you into my world, the world of experts.Now there are, of course, exceptions, wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions. But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps, that within these camps, a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition, that experts move with the prevailing winds, often hero-worshipping their own gurus. Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on, not challenged by his peers, until after the crisis, of course. You see, we also learn that experts are located, are governed, by the social and cultural norms of their times \u2014 whether it be the doctors in Victorian England, say, who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire, or the psychiatrists in the United States who, up until 1973, were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness.And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift, that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks \u2014 because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects, or studies funded by food companies of their new products, massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study.And we've also got to be aware that experts, of course, also make mistakes. They make mistakes every single day \u2014 mistakes born out of carelessness. A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries, operating on the wrong side of the brain, carrying out procedures on the wrong hand, elbow, eye, foot, and also mistakes born out of thinking errors. A common thinking error of radiologists, for example \u2014 when they look at CT scans \u2014 is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say, what happens is that, if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan, they literally stop looking at it \u2014 thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs.I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. These are, of course, not the only insights I could share, but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them, why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on. But how can we do this? Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. First, we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles. This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. in every single subject, you'll be relieved to hear. But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when, for example, we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. Why was it that, when I had an operation, my doctor said to me, \"Beware, Ms. Hertz, of hyperpyrexia,\" when he could have just as easily said, \"Watch out for a high fever.\" You see, being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs, their equations, their forecasts, their prophecies, and being armed with the questions to do that \u2014 questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this? What is the evidence upon which this is based? What has your investigation focused on? And what has it ignored?It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first, primarily on male animals and then, primarily on men. It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men \u2014 and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed.Second, we need to create the space for what I call \"managed dissent.\" If we are to shift paradigms, if we are to make breakthroughs, if we are to destroy myths, we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out, in which we're bringing in new, diverse, discordant, heretical views into the discussion, fearlessly, in the knowledge that progress comes about, not only from the creation of ideas, but also from their destruction \u2014 and also from the knowledge that, by surrounding ourselves by divergent, discordant, heretical views. All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts, which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent.Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room \u2014 arms crossed, looking a bit bemused \u2014 and draws them into the discussion, trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion, so that they have dissent within the room. Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement, discord and difference. But we need to go even further. We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees, fancy titles, diplomas, best-selling books \u2014 high-status individuals. But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise \u2014 whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's, but also shop-girls \u2014 yeah.Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees \u2014 the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team \u2014 to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time. By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company, Best Buy was able to discover, for example, that the store that it was going to open in China \u2014 its big, grand store \u2014 was not going to open on time. Because when it asked its staff, all its staff, to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not, a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening. It turned out that they were aware, as no one else within the company was, of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts, nor the experts on the ground in China, were even aware of.The strategies that I have discussed this evening \u2014 embracing dissent, taking experts on, democratizing expertise, rebellious strategies \u2014 are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing, complex, difficult times. For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on, if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical, if we devolve authority, if we are rebellious, but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance, uncertainty and doubt, and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too, we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century. For now, more than ever, is not the time to be blindly following, blindly accepting, blindly trusting. Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open \u2014 yes, using experts to help us figure things out, for sure \u2014 I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here \u2014 but being aware of their limitations and, of course, also our own.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1079, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nIt's

high\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand the decision really matters.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nBecause in a world of data deluge\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nand extreme

00:02:36.958\nBut I believe\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nthat this is a big problem,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\na problem with potentially dangerous consequences\n\n00:02:42.958 -->

recent experiment,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\na group of adults\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nhad their brains scanned in an MRI machine\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nas they were listening to experts speak.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThe results were quite extraordinary.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAs they listened to the experts' voices,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthe independent decision-making parts of their brains\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nswitched off.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nIt literally flat-lined.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd they listened to whatever the experts said\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand took their advice, however right or wrong.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nBut experts do get things wrong.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nDid you know that studies show\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat doctors misdiagnose\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nfour times out of 10?\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nDid you know\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat if you file your tax returns yourself,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nyou're statistically more likely\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nto be filing them correctly\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthan if you get a tax adviser\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nto do it for you?\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd then there's, of course, the example\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat we're all too aware of:\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfinancial experts\n\n00:04:40.958 -->

as an economist\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwho, over the past few years,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nhas focused my research\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\non what it is we

00:05:35.958\nthat the role of experts needs to change,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthat we need to become more open-minded,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nmore democratic\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand be more open\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nto people rebelling against\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nour points of view.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo in order to help

what my research has shown me\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nis that experts tend on the whole\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto form very rigid camps,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat within these camps,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\na dominant perspective emerges\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthat often silences opposition,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat experts move with the prevailing winds,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\noften hero-worshipping\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\ntheir own gurus.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAlan Greenspan's

1973,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwere still categorizing homosexuality\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nas a mental illness.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd what all this

willing\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nto take experts on\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nand dispense with this notion of them\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nas modern-day apostles.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThis doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nin every single subject,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nyou'll be relieved to hear.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nBut it does mean persisting\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nin the face of their inevitable annoyance\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwhen, for example,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nwe want them to explain things to us\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nin language that we can actually understand.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nWhy was it that, when I had an operation,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nmy doctor said to me,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\n\"Beware, Ms. Hertz,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nof hyperpyrexia,\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nwhen he could have just as easily said,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\n\"Watch out for a high fever.\"\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nYou see, being ready to take experts on\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nis about also being willing\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nto dig behind their graphs,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\ntheir equations, their forecasts,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\ntheir prophecies,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand being armed with the questions to do that --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nquestions like:\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nWhat are the assumptions that underpin this?\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nWhat is the evidence upon which this is based?\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWhat has your investigation focused on?\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nAnd what has it ignored?\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nIt recently came out\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthat experts trialing drugs\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nbefore they come to market\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\ntypically trial drugs\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nfirst, primarily on male animals\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand then, primarily on men.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nIt seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nthat over half the world's population are women.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd women have drawn the short medical straw\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nbecause it now turns out that many of these drugs\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\ndon't work nearly as well on women\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nas they do on men --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand the drugs that do work well work so well\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat they're actively harmful for women to take.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nBeing a rebel is about recognizing\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthat experts' assumptions\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand their methodologies\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\ncan easily be flawed.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSecond,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nwe need to create the space\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nfor what I call \"managed dissent.\"\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIf we are to shift paradigms,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nif we are to make breakthroughs,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nif we are to destroy myths,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwe need to create an environment\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nin which expert ideas are battling it out,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nin which we're bringing in\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nnew, diverse, discordant, heretical views\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\ninto the discussion,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nfearlessly,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nin the knowledge that progress comes about,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nnot only from the creation of ideas,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nbut also from their destruction --\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nand also from the knowledge\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nthat, by surrounding ourselves\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nby divergent, discordant,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nheretical views.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAll the research now shows us\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthat this actually makes us smarter.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nEncouraging dissent is a rebellious notion\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbecause it goes against our very instincts,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nwhich are to surround ourselves\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwith opinions and advice\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nthat we already believe\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nor want to be true.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAnd that's why I talk about the need\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nto actively manage dissent.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nis a practical practitioner\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nof this philosophy.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nIn meetings,

discussion,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\ntrying to see if they indeed are\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe person with a different opinion,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nso that they have dissent within the room.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nManaging dissent\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nis about recognizing the value\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nof disagreement,

redefine\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwho it is that experts are.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThe conventional notion\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nis that experts are people\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwith advanced degrees,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nfancy titles, diplomas,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nbest-selling books --\n\n00:14:28.958 -->

{"title": "Saving faces: A facial surgeon's craft", "duration": "954", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/iain_hutchison_saving_faces", "transcript": "Our face is hugely important because it's the external, visual part that everybody else sees. Let's not forget it's a functional entity. We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain. It's where our senses are located, our special senses \u2014 our vision, our speech, our hearing, our smell, our taste. And this bone is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull with cavities, the sinuses, which warm and moisten the air we breathe. But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone \u2014 our head would be dead weight, we wouldn't be able to hold it erect, we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us. This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat.Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression, our universal language of expression, our social-signaling system. And overlying this is the skin drape, which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure \u2014 taking right-angled bends here and there, having thin areas like the eyelids, thick areas like the cheek, different colors. And then we have the sensual factor of the face. Where do we like to kiss people? On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. It's the face where we're attracted to with that.But let's not forget the hair. You're looking at the image on your left-hand side \u2014 that's my son with his eyebrows present. Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing. There's a definite difference. And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose, he'd look even odder still.Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves, and we only see ourselves in freeze-frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live. Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. They don't need this. They need psychiatric help. Max has kindly donated his photograph to me. He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic. In other words, he looks entirely normal.Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes. So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves, by the behavior of adults around them. Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose, and she's having difficulty seeing. As you can see, it's blocking her vision. She's also in danger, when she damages this, of bleeding profusely. Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them. They've grown used to their face; they think they're special. Actually, sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them. But other adults say incredibly painful things. They say, \"How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people. Shouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?\" And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion, because \u2014 a natural curiosity. And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature. After surgery, everything normalizes. The adults behave more naturally, and the children play more readily with other children.As teenagers \u2014 just think back to your teenage years \u2014 we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. We're trying to struggle to find our identity. We crave the approval of our peers. So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world. Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days. How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day, practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look, trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did, trying to raise one eyebrow? It's a crippling time.I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. Turn to the person next to you, push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you and look at them \u2014 they look miserable. That's exactly what people used to say to Sue. She wasn't miserable at all. But people used to say to her, \"Why are you so miserable?\" People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school. So she chose to have facial surgery. After the facial surgery, she said, \"My face now reflects my personality. People know now that I'm enthusiastic, that I'm a happy person.\" And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.Is this change, though, a real change, or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves? Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. And what we found was \u2014 we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after \u2014 what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery. Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them on honesty, intelligence, friendliness, violence. They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics \u2014 more violent, etc. \u2014 before the surgery. After the surgery, they were perceived as being more intelligent, more friendly, more honest, less violent \u2014 and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character.When people get older, they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. So this is a photograph of Henry, two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face \u2014 his cheekbone, his upper jaw, his eye-socket. He looks pretty good at this stage. But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations, as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly. I learned a huge amount from Henry. Henry taught me that you can carry on working. He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket. He enjoyed life to the full, and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially. He maintained a calm insouciance. I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it. This was something more than that. He ignored it. He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it. And that's what these people can do.Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. This is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on. It was my longest operation. It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. We removed all the bones at the right side of his face \u2014 his eye, his nose, the skull bones, the facial skin \u2014 and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. And again, he said, \"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.\" His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family; he had a successful, fulfilling job.So we've seen that we can change people's faces. But when we change people's faces, are we changing their identity \u2014 for better or for worse? For instance, there are two different types of facial surgery. We can categorize it like that. We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery \u2014 like Sue. When they have facial surgery, they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people. They don't feel different. They feel that they've actually gained what they never had, that their face now reflects their personality. And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery. Because you might say, \"Well, this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic.\" If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy. They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality.But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. They're people who have their face shot off. I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. They have it forced upon them. And again, as I told you, if they have a caring family and good work life, then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. Their identity doesn't change.Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon? Muzetta's family give the lie to this. This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face, which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly. After she had surgery to remove the tumor, her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress, a pink ribbon in her hair, and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world, despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa. So it's not simply a Western phenomenon.We make judgments on people's faces all the time. It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces. He said you could see criminal faces, judging them just on the photographs that were showed. Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly. We look at O.J. \u2014 he's a good-looking guy. We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly. Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer, and actually he's not the good guy. And beauty doesn't equate to goodness, and certainly doesn't equate to contentment.So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face, but actually, we're more comfortable with judging the moving face. We think we can judge people on their expressions. U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity \u2014 the blink, the hesitation. And so they want to see live witnesses. Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second, we can make a judgment on somebody's face. Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are. Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face, our financial adviser's face was covered? We'd be pretty uncomfortable. But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement? The truth is that there's a five-minute rule, not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule. If you spend five minutes with somebody, you start looking beyond their facial appearance, and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them, and the people who you didn't immediately seek out, because you didn't find them particularly attractive, become attractive people because of their personality.So we've talked a lot about facial appearance. I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do \u2014 where we're at and where we're going. This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. And you can see in the images afterward, we've managed to reconstruct her successfully. But that's not good enough. This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking, she wants to be out climbing mountains. And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.This is a horrific image, so I'm putting my hand up now. This is a photograph of Adi, a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery. And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin and his upper jaw and teeth. This is the bar that he set for us. \"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.\" So with modern technology, we used computers to make models. We made a model of the jaw without bone in it. We then bent a plate up to it. We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position. We then put bone and tissue from the back. Here you can see the plate holding it, and you can see the implants being put in \u2014 so that in one operation we achieve this and this. So the patient's life is restored. That's the good news. However, his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before. It's skin from his back. It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours. And that's where we're failing, and that's where we need the face transplant.The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin. We can replace the underlying skeletal structure, but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin. So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. What does that mean? They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy. This is not a life-saving transplant \u2014 like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant \u2014 it is a quality-of-life transplant, and as a result, are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on, \"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer\"? We don't know yet. We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation, are studying that. Donors are going to be short on the ground, because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death? So there are going to be problems with face transplantation.So the better news is the future's almost here \u2014 and the future is tissue engineering. Just imagine, I can make a biologically-degradable template. I can put it in place where it's meant to be. I can sprinkle a few cells, stem cells from the patient's own hip, a little bit of genetically engineered protein, and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown. This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.But we've still got problems. We've got mouth cancer to solve. We're still not curing enough patients \u2014 it's the most disfiguring cancer. We're still not reconstructing them well enough. In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people. We still can't get rid of scars. We need to do research. And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research. And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future, so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, \"Okay, we're doing okay. Let's leave it as it is.\"Thank you very much indeed.(Applause)", "id": 1080, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nOur face is hugely important\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nbecause it's the external, visual part\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthat everybody else sees.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nLet's not forget it's a functional entity.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nWe have strong skull bones\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nthat protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nIt's where our senses are located, our special senses --\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nour vision, our speech,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nour hearing, our smell, our taste.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd this bone\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nis peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nwith cavities, the sinuses,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nwhich warm and moisten the air we breathe.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nBut also imagine if they were filled with solid bone --\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nour head would be dead weight,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nwe wouldn't be able to hold it erect,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nwe wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nThis woman is slowly dying\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nbecause the benign tumors in her facial bones\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nhave completely obliterated her mouth and her nose\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nso she can't breathe and eat.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAttached to the facial bones\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthat define our face's structure\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nare the muscles that deliver our facial expression,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nour universal language of expression,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nour social-signaling system.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nAnd overlying this is the skin drape,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwhich is a hugely complex\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthree-dimensional structure --\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\ntaking right-angled bends here and there,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nhaving thin areas like the eyelids,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthick areas like the cheek, different colors.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd then we have the sensual factor of the face.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nWhere do we like to kiss people?\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nOn the lips.

Why haven't you had it removed?\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nbecause -- a natural curiosity.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd that obviously alerts the child\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nto their unusual nature.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAfter surgery, everything normalizes.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThe adults behave more naturally,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand the children play more readily with other children.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAs teenagers --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\njust think back to your teenage years --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe're going through a dramatic\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand often disproportionate change\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nin our facial appearance.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nWe're trying to struggle to find our identity.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nWe crave the approval of our peers.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nSo our facial appearance is vital to us\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nas we're trying to project ourselves to the world.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nJust remember that single acne spot\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat crippled you for several days.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nHow long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\npracticing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\ntrying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ntrying to raise one eyebrow?\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nIt's a crippling time.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI've chosen to show this profile view of Sue\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nbecause what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand her lower lip jutting forward.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nTurn to the person next to you,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\npush your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand look at them -- they look miserable.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nThat's exactly what people used to say to Sue.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nShe wasn't miserable at all.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nBut people used to say to her, \"Why are you so miserable?\"\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nPeople were making misjudgments all the time\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\non her mood.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nTeachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nSo she chose to have facial surgery.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAfter the facial surgery,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nshe said, \"My face now reflects my personality.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nPeople know now that I'm enthusiastic,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthat I'm a happy person.\"\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nIs this change, though, a real change,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nor is it a figment of the imagination\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nof the patient themselves?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nWell we studied teenagers' attitudes\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nto photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd what we found was --\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nwe jumbled up the photographs\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nso they couldn't recognize the before and after --\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwhat we found was that the patients were regarded\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nas being more attractive after the surgery.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWell that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\non honesty, intelligence,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nfriendliness, violence.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nThey were all perceived as being\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nless than normal in all those characteristics --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nmore violent, etc. -- before the surgery.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAfter the surgery,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthey were perceived as being more intelligent,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nmore friendly, more honest, less violent --\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand yet we hadn't operated on their intellect\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nor their character.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nWhen people get older,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthey don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nTheir presence in the consultation suite\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nis a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWhat happens to them\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo this is a photograph of Henry,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\ntwo weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nfrom the left side of his face -- his cheekbone,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhis upper jaw, his eye-socket.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nHe looks pretty good at this stage.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nBut over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nas the disease ravaged his face\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand destroyed my reconstruction regularly.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nI learned a huge amount from Henry.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nHenry taught me\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthat you can carry on working.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nHe worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nHe enjoyed life to the full,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand a caring family\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand was able to participate socially.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHe maintained a calm insouciance.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nI don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThis was something more than that. He ignored it.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nHe ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand carried on oblivious to it.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd that's what these people can do.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nHenriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThis is a man in his 20s\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nthat he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nIt was my longest operation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nIt took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nWe removed all the bones at the right side of his face --\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nhis eye, his nose,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthe skull bones, the facial skin --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand reconstructed him with tissue from the back.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHe continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nHe got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd again, he said,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n\"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nshows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.\"\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nHis facial disfigurement\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\ndid not affect him\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nbecause he had the support of a family;\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nhe had a successful, fulfilling job.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo we've seen that we can change people's faces.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBut when we change people's faces,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nare we changing their identity --\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nfor better or for worse?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nFor instance,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthere are two different types of facial surgery.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWe can categorize it like that.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWe can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nlike Sue.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWhen they have facial surgery,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthey feel their lives have changed\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbecause other people perceive them\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nas better people.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThey don't feel different.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThey feel that they've actually gained\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhat they never had,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthat their face now reflects their personality.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand this kind of surgery.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBecause you might say, \"Well, this type of surgery\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nmight be regarded as cosmetic.\"\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIf you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nThey're trying to achieve difference in their lives.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nShe was just trying to achieve the face\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthat matched her personality.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nBut then we have other people\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nwho don't choose to have facial surgery.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThey're people who have their face shot off.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nI'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThey have it forced upon them.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd again, as I told you,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nif they have a caring family\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand good work life,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthen they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nTheir identity doesn't change.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIs this business\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nabout appearance and preoccupation with it\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\na Western phenomenon?\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nMuzetta's family give the lie to this.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThis is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwho's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhich has already made her blind\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAfter she had surgery to remove the tumor,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nher parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\na pink ribbon in her hair,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\ndespite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand the mother wore a full burqa.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nSo it's not simply a Western phenomenon.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nWe make judgments on people's faces\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nall the time.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIt's been going on since we can think of Lombroso\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand the way he would define criminal faces.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe said you could see criminal faces,\n\n00:10:27.958 -->

She wants to be out kayaking,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nshe wants to be out climbing mountains.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nThis is a horrific image,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nso I'm putting my hand up now.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThis is a photograph of Adi,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\na Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nin an armed robbery.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nAnd he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand his upper jaw and teeth.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThis is the bar that he set for us.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\n\"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.\"\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo with modern technology,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwe used computers to make models.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe made a model of the jaw without bone in it.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWe then bent a plate up to it.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWe put it in place\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nso we knew it was an accurate position.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWe then put bone and tissue from the back.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nHere you can see the plate holding it,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nand you can see the implants being put in --\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nso that in one operation\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwe achieve this\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand this.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nSo the patient's life is restored.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThat's the good news.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nHowever, his chin skin\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\ndoesn't look the same as it did before.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nIt's skin from his back.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nIt's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd that's where we're failing,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand that's where we need the face transplant.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nThe face transplant has a role\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nprobably in burns patients to replace the skin.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nWe can replace the underlying skeletal structure,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nbut we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo it's very valuable\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nto have that tool in our armamentarium.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nBut the patients are going to have to take drugs\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nthat suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWhat does that mean?\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThey have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThis is not a life-saving transplant --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nlike a heart, or liver, or lung transplant --\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nit is a quality-of-life transplant,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand as a result,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nare the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\n\"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nbecause I'm now dying of a malignant cancer\"?

The year is 1963. We're at the ocean. It's twilight. We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides. It's a stretch of beach we know so well. The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us. If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes, you might dismiss them as poor and simple. That would be a mistake. These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators, trained in the old ways by their elders, and now they're passing it on to me. They teach me the names of the winds and the rains, of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars. There's a new moon on the horizon. Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing. They begin to chant.[Hawaiian chant]When they finish, they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. They want to teach me about my destiny. I thought every seven-year-old went through this. (Laughter) \"Baby girl, someday the world will be in trouble. People will forget their wisdom. It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance. You will go far away. It will sometimes be a lonely road. We will not be there. But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers, and you will recognize your ohana, your family. And it will take all of you. It will take all of you.\" These words, I hold onto all my life. Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me.The year is 2007. I'm on a remote island in Micronesia. Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide. It's the home of my mentor. His name is Pius Mau Piailug. Mau is a palu, a navigator priest. He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world. There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island. Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars, the sequence and direction of waves, the flight patterns of certain birds. Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull, it appeared that an old man was going to rest. In fact, the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. Mau was, in fact, gathering explicit data using his entire body. It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel.The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance. Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island, and he would look out, and then he would say, \"Okay, we go.\" He saw that first glint of light \u2014 he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically, are extraordinary, and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. We are in such a critical moment of our collective history. They have been compared to astronauts \u2014 these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. Their canoes, our rockets; their sea, our space. The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. This is part of our collective narrative. It's humanity's DNA. We cannot afford to lose it.The year is 2010. Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted, the world is in trouble. We live in a society bloated with data, yet starved for wisdom. We're connected 24/7, yet anxiety, fear, depression and loneliness is at an all-time high. We must course-correct. An African shaman said, \"Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes.\" The link between the past and the future is fragile. This I know intimately, because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them, I struggle. I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains.Mau passed away five months ago, but his legacy and lessons live on. And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them, as potent as the Micronesian navigators, that are going dismissed, that this is a testament to brilliant, brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly. Because when an elder dies a library is burned, and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. And this is what he said: \"The island is the canoe; the canoe, the island.\" And what he meant was, if you are voyaging and far from home, your very survival depends on everyone aboard. You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to. This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. It always was.So in closing I would offer you this: The planet is our canoe, and we are the voyagers. True navigation begins in the human heart. It's the most important map of all. Together, may we journey well.(Applause)", "id": 1081, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nAs a child,\n\n00:00:14.958 -->

through proteomics", "duration": "1195", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/danny_hillis_two_frontiers_of_cancer_treatment", "transcript": "I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here because I'm going to say some radical things, about how we should think about cancer differently, to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do. But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. (Laughter) And that this, in fact, will be the way that we treat cancer in the future. In order to talk about cancer, I'm going to actually have to \u2014 let me get the big slide here. First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics. I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on \u2014 and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics. Having explained those, that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer.So let me start with genomics. It is the hot topic. It is the place where we're learning the most. This is the great frontier. But it has its limitations. And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body, and if that were only true, it would be great, but it's not. It's like the parts list of your body. It doesn't say how things are connected, what causes what and so on. So if I can make an analogy, let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant, and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn't have butter, you could say, \"Ah, I see what's wrong with them. I can make them healthy.\" And there probably are special cases of that. You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. So the list of ingredients does tell you something, and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. If they have tons of salt, you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that. But it's limited, because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant, you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen, you need the product of all of those ingredients.So if I look at a person and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing. The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients. And so indeed, there are times when we can find ingredients that [are] bad. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease, and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen, because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people \u2014 they have the same genome. So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition. So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person \u2014 except in some of these special cases.So why all the big deal about genetics? Well first of all, it's because we can read it, which is fantastic. It is very useful in certain circumstances. It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology. It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on. And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct. So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing, and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing, and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. So this happens in physics all the time. You predict a black hole, and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said. But it rarely happens in biology. So this great triumph \u2014 it's so good, there's almost a religious experience in biology. And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory.So the other reason it's been very popular is because we can measure it, it's digital. And in fact, thanks to Kary Mullis, you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients. So for instance, by measuring the genome, we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome, or how we're related to each other \u2014 the family tree, or the tree of life. There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. Now of course, in medical application, that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history \u2014 except probably, your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. And so by reading the genome, we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives, but they may be surprising. I did the 23andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald. (Laughter) But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.But mostly what you need to know, to find out if you're sick, is not your predispositions, but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. So to do that, what you really need to do, you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics, and that's what proteomics is about. Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes, proteomics is the study of all the proteins. And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells \u2014 actually, the machines that are operating \u2014 that's where the action is. Basically, a human body is a conversation going on, both within the cells and between the cells, and they're telling each other to grow and to die, and when you're sick, something's gone wrong with that conversation. And so the trick is \u2014 unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome.So the problem is that measuring \u2014 if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process. It requires hundreds of steps, and it takes a long, long time. And it matters how much of the protein it is. It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent, so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA. And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage, they pause for just a moment, and they leave something in an enzyme for a second, and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way. People have tried very hard to do this. I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it.I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus. And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems, and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back, so I kept on giving him to the delay list. And then one day, I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. (Laughter) So I was like, \"Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.\" (Laughter) So we started talking, and he said, \"I really need a better way to measure proteins.\" I'm like, \"Looked at that. Been there. Not going to be easy.\" He's like, \"No, no. I really need it. I mean, I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. We have to have a window into this.\" And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference, if we could do it, and so I said, \"Well, let's look at it.\"Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. So we started playing around with this. And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem \u2014 that taking the sip of coffee \u2014 that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics. And so we did that, and working with David, we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually, which makes this robotic assembly line, which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein. And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.Basically, what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient, and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh, how slippery they are, and we arrange them in an image. And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood. And we can take a different one tomorrow, and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different \u2014 they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep. They really tell us what's going on there. And so this picture, which looks like a big smudge to you, is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track. So if I zoom into that picture, I can just show you what it means. We sort out the proteins \u2014 from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting, and from top to bottom is how slippery they are. So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that \u2014 carbon comes in different isotopes, so if it has an extra neutron on it, we actually measure it as a different chemical. So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is. So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time, and suddenly you say, \"Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was.\" But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it. So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns. So what we do with this is, for example, we can look at two patients, one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug, and ask, \"What's going on differently inside of them?\" And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red. We overlay them. This is actual data. And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow, but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug, we see that in the blood, they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. We might not even know what this protein is, but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. So this already, I think, is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. So let me move to cancer.The thing about cancer \u2014 when I got into this, I really knew nothing about it, but working with David Agus, I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out. And as I looked at it, to me it didn't make sense how we were approaching cancer, and in order to make sense of it, I had to learn where did this come from. We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. So this is the great paradigm. This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked \u2014 was the germ theory of disease. So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose \u2014 that is, put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis \u2014 and that works great for infectious diseases. So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin. We know that that works. If you've got malaria, we give you quinine or some derivative of it. And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do, and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease \u2014 how well it works. And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this.But now let's apply that to systems diseases like cancer. The problem is that, in cancer, there isn't something else that's inside of you. It's you; you're broken. That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way. So how do we diagnose that conversation? Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body \u2014 you know, where did it appear? \u2014 and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer, and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong. And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system. And in fact, I think we're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing. I think this is the big mistake. I think cancer should not be a noun. We should talk about cancering as something we do, not something we have. And so those tumors, those are symptoms of cancer. And so your body is probably cancering all the time, but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control.And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb, imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing, and the way that we talked about it, we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say, \"Oh, my house has water.\" We might divide it \u2014 the plumber would say, \"Well, where's the water?\" \"Well, it's in the kitchen.\" \"Oh, you must have kitchen water.\" That's kind of the level at which it is. \"Kitchen water, well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen, that helps. Whereas living room water, it's better to do tar on the roof.\" And it sounds silly, but that's basically what we do. And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer, but I'm saying that's not really the problem; that's the symptom of the problem.What we really need to get at is the process that's going on, and that's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions, happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does? Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time. So your house is dealing with leaks all the time, but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on. So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on, and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that.David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there. And so I gave this talk and said, \"Why don't you guys do this?\" And Anna said, \"Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research.\" So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world, from Cold Spring Harbor, Stanford, Austin \u2014 I won't even go through and name all the places \u2014 to have a research project that will last for five years where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this. We're doing it in mice first, and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this, but they will die for a good cause. And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand, when cancer happens, what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer.So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. So I think eventually, once we have one of these models for people, which we'll get eventually \u2014 I mean, our group won't get all the way there \u2014 but eventually we'll have a very good computer model \u2014 sort of like a global climate model for weather. It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer \u2014 and this also will be for ALS, or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases, things like that \u2014 we will simulate specifically you, not just a generic person, but what's actually going on inside you.And in that simulation, what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments, and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs. It might be things like, don't eat that day, or give them a little chemotherapy, maybe a little radiation. Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on. But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health \u2014 guide your body back to health. Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. We put it in the equivalent of splints. And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer, and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job.And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. It's going to require a lot of work, a lot of research. There will be many teams like our team that work on this. But I think eventually, we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer.So thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1082, "subtitle":

radical things,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nabout how we should think about cancer differently,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nto an audience that contains a lot of people\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nwho know a lot more about cancer than I do.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nBut I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nbecause I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nAnd that this, in fact, will be\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthe way that we treat cancer in the future.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nIn order to talk about cancer,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nI'm going to actually have to --\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nlet me get the big slide here.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nFirst, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nI want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nof all the other things that are going on --\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nHaving explained those,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nthat will set up for what I think will be a different idea\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nabout how to go about treating cancer.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo let me start with genomics.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nIt is the hot topic.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt is the place where we're learning the most.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nThis is the great frontier.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBut it has its limitations.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat the genome is like the blueprint of your body,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand if that were only true, it would be great,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nbut it's not.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nIt's like the parts list of your body.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nIt doesn't say how things are connected,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nwhat causes what and so on.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nSo if I can make an analogy,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nlet's say that you were trying to tell the difference\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nbetween a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand a sick restaurant,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand all you had was the list of ingredients\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthat they had in their larder.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nSo it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand you looked through it and you found\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthey only had margarine and they didn't have butter,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nyou could say, \"Ah, I see what's wrong with them.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nI can make them healthy.\"\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nAnd there probably are special cases of that.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nYou could certainly tell the difference\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nbetween a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nby what they had in a larder.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nSo the list of ingredients does tell you something,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nIf they have tons of salt,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nyou might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBut it's limited,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nbecause really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nyou need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nyou need the product of all of those ingredients.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo if I look at a person\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThe part of the genome that we can read\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nis the list of ingredients.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd so indeed,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthere are times when we can find ingredients\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nthat [are] bad.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nCystic fibrosis is an example of a disease\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwhere you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand we can actually make a direct correspondence\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nbetween the ingredient and the disease.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nBut most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nbecause, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthey have the same genome.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo the genome really tells you much more\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nabout predisposition.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nSo what you can tell\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nis you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nby looking at their ingredients list.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBut you really for the most part can't tell the difference\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbetween a healthy person and a sick person --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nexcept in some of these special cases.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nSo why all the big deal\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nabout genetics?\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWell first of all,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nit's because we can read it, which is fantastic.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt is very useful in certain circumstances.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nIt's also the great theoretical triumph\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nof biology.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nIt's the one theory\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthat the biologists ever really got right.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIt's fundamental to Darwin\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand Mendel and so on.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nAnd so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nSo Mendel had this idea of a gene\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nas an abstract thing,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand Darwin built a whole theory\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthat depended on them existing,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand then Watson and Crick\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nactually looked and found one.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nSo this happens in physics all the time.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nYou predict a black hole,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nBut it rarely happens in biology.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSo this great triumph -- it's so good,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthere's almost a religious experience\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nin biology.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd Darwinian evolution\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nis really the core theory.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nSo the other reason it's been very popular\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nis because we can measure it, it's digital.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd in fact,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthanks to Kary Mullis,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nyou can basically measure your genome in your kitchen\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwith a few extra ingredients.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo for instance, by measuring the genome,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwe've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nby the closeness of our genome,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nor how we're related to each other -- the family tree,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nor the tree of life.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThere's a huge amount of information about the genetics\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\njust by comparing the genetic similarity.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNow of course, in medical application,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthat is very useful\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbecause it's the same kind of information\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nthat the doctor gets from your family medical history --\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nexcept probably,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nyour genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd so by reading the genome,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwe can find out much more about your family than you probably know.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd so we can discover things\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat probably you could have found\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nby looking at enough of your relatives,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nbut they may be surprising.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nI did the 23andMe thing\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBut sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nBut mostly\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nwhat you need to know, to find out if you're sick,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nis not your predispositions,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nbut it's actually what's going on in your body right now.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nSo to do that, what you really need to do,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nyou need to look at the things\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthat the genes are producing\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand what's happening after the genetics,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand that's what proteomics is about.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nJust like genome mixes the study of all the genes,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nproteomics is the study of all the proteins.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the proteins are all of the little things in your body\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat are signaling between the cells --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nactually, the machines that are operating --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat's where the action is.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nBasically, a human body\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nis a conversation going on,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nboth within the cells and between the cells,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand they're telling each other to grow and to die,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand when you're sick,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nsomething's gone wrong with that conversation.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd so the trick is --\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nunfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nlike we can measure the genome.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo the problem is that measuring --\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nif you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIt requires hundreds of steps,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand it takes a long, long time.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd it matters how much of the protein it is.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nso it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd basically our problem is somebody's in the middle\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nof this very long stage,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthey pause for just a moment,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand they leave something in an enzyme for a second,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand all of a sudden all the measurements from then on\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\ndon't work.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd so then people get very inconsistent results\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhen they do it this way.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nPeople have tried very hard to do this.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI tried this a couple of times\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand looked at this problem and gave up on it.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI kept getting this call from this oncologist\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nnamed David Agus.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd Applied Minds gets a lot of calls\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nfrom people who want help with their problems,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nso I kept on giving him to the delay list.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd then one day,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand Al Gore on the same day\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nsaying return David Agus's phone call.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nSo I was like, \"Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.\"\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nSo we started talking,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand he said, \"I really need a better way to measure proteins.\"\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nI'm like, \"Looked at that. Been there.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nNot going to be easy.\"\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nHe's like, \"No, no. I really need it.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI mean, I see patients dying every day\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nbecause we don't know what's going on inside of them.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe have to have a window into this.\"\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd he took me through\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nspecific examples of when he really needed it.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nif we could do it,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nand so I said, \"Well, let's look at it.\"\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nApplied Minds has enough play money\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthat we can go and just work on something\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nwithout getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nSo we started playing around with this.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nthat taking the sip of coffee --\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat there were humans doing this complicated process\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand that what really needed to be done\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nwas to automate this process like an assembly line\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand build robots\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthat would measure proteomics.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd so we did that,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand working with David,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nwe made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nwhich makes this robotic assembly line,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhich, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBasically, what we do\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nis we take a drop of blood\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nout of a patient,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand we sort out the proteins\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nin the drop of blood\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\naccording to how much they weigh,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nhow slippery they are,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand we arrange them in an image.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd so we can look at literally\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nhundreds of thousands of features at once\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nout of that drop of blood.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd we can take a different one tomorrow,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different --\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthey'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThey really tell us what's going on there.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd so this picture,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhich looks like a big smudge to you,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nis actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand made me feel like we were on the right track.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo if I zoom into that picture,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nI can just show you what it means.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nWe sort out the proteins -- from left to right\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nis the weight of the fragments that we're getting,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand from top to bottom is how slippery they are.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nSo we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd so each of these lines\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nrepresents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd you can see how the lines occur\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nin these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\ncarbon comes in different isotopes,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nso if it has an extra neutron on it,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwe actually measure it as a different chemical.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nSo we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd so that gives you an idea\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nof how exquisitely sensitive this is.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nSo seeing this picture\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nis sort of like getting to be Galileo\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand looking at the stars\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand looking through the telescope for the first time,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand suddenly you say, \"Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was.\"\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nBut we can see that stuff out there\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand actually see features of it.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nSo what we do with this\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nis, for example, we can look at two patients,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\none that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand ask, \"What's going on differently\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\ninside of them?\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd so we can make these measurements precisely enough\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nthat we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nSo here we have Alice in green\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand Bob in red.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nWe overlay them. This is actual data.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nbut there's some things that just Alice has\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand some things that just Bob has.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd if we find a pattern of things\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nof the responders to the drug,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwe see that in the blood,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthey have the condition\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nthat allows them to respond to this drug.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nWe might not even know what this protein is,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbut we can see it's a marker\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nfor the response to the disease.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo this already, I think,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nBut I think this is actually\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\njust the beginning\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nof how we're going to treat cancer.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo let me move to cancer.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThe thing about cancer --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwhen I got into this,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nI really knew nothing about it,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nbut working with David Agus,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nI started watching how cancer was actually being treated\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nand went to operations where it was being cut out.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd as I looked at it,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nto me it didn't make sense\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nhow we were approaching cancer,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand in order to make sense of it,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nI had to learn where did this come from.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nWe're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWe're treating it as something that got inside of you\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthat we have to kill.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo this is the great paradigm.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nThis is another case\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nwhere a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked --\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nwas the germ theory of disease.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo what doctors are mostly trained to do\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nis diagnose --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthat is, put you into a category\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand apply a scientifically proven treatment\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nfor that diagnosis --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand that works great for infectious diseases.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo if we put you in the category\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nof you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nWe know that that works.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIf you've got malaria, we give you quinine\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nor some derivative of it.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nand it's miraculous\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin the case of infectious disease --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nhow well it works.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nif doctors didn't do this.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nBut now let's apply that\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nto systems diseases like cancer.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe problem is that, in cancer,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthere isn't something else\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nthat's inside of you.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nIt's you; you're broken.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThat conversation inside of you\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\ngot mixed up in some way.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nSo how do we diagnose that conversation?\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nWell, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body --\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nyou know, where did it appear? --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand we put you in different categories\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\naccording to the part of the body.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd then we do a clinical trial\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nfor a drug for lung cancer\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nand we treat these as if they're separate diseases\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand that this way of dividing them\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nhad something to do with what actually went wrong.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nAnd of course, it really doesn't have that much to do\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwith what went wrong\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbecause cancer is a failure of the system.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd in fact, I think we're even wrong\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwhen we talk about cancer as a thing.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nI think this is the big mistake.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI think cancer should not be a noun.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe should talk about cancering\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nas something we do, not something we have.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd so those tumors,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthose are symptoms of cancer.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd so your body is probably cancering all the time,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nbut there are lots of systems in your body\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthat keep it under control.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd so to give you an idea\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nof an analogy of what I mean\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nby thinking of cancering as a verb,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nimagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand the way that we talked about it,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nand we'd say, \"Oh, my house has water.\"\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe might divide it -- the plumber would say, \"Well, where's the water?\"\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\n\"Well, it's in the kitchen.\" \"Oh, you must have kitchen water.\"\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThat's kind of the level at which it is.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n\"Kitchen water,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nwell, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthat helps.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nWhereas living room water,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nit's better to do tar on the roof.\"\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd it sounds silly,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nbut that's basically what we do.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nbut I'm saying that's not really the problem;\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nthat's the symptom of the problem.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nWhat we really need to get at\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nis the process that's going on,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nand that's happening at the level\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nof the proteonomic actions,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nhappening at the level of why is your body not healing itself\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nin the way that it normally does?\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nBecause normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo your house is dealing with leaks all the time,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbut it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo what we need\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nis to have a causative model\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nof what's actually going on,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand proteomics actually gives us\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nthe ability to build a model like that.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nDavid got me invited\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nto give a talk at National Cancer Institute\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nand Anna Barker was there.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nAnd so I gave this talk\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand said, \"Why don't you guys do this?\"\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd Anna said,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\n\"Because nobody within cancer\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nwould look at it this way.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nBut what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nfor people outside the field of cancer\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nto get together with doctors\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nwho really know about cancer\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nand work out different programs of research.\"\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nSo David and I applied to this program\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand created a consortium\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nat USC\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nwhere we've got some of the best oncologists in the world\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nand some of the best biologists in the world,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nfrom Cold Spring Harbor,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nStanford, Austin --\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nI won't even go through and name all the places --\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nto have a research project\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nthat will last for five years\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nwhere we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nWe're doing it in mice first,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand we will kill a lot of mice\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nin the process of doing this,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nbut they will die for a good cause.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nAnd we will actually try to get to the point\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nwhere we have a predictive model\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nwhere we can understand,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nwhen cancer happens,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nwhat's actually happening in there\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nand which treatment will treat that cancer.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nSo let me just end with giving you a little picture\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nof what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nSo I think eventually,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nonce we have one of these models for people,\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwhich we'll get eventually --\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nI mean, our group won't get all the way there --\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nbut eventually we'll have a very good computer model --\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nsort of like a global climate model for weather.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nIt has lots of different information\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nabout what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\non many different scales.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd so we will simulate\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nin that model\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nfor your particular cancer --\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nand this also will be for ALS,\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nor any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nthings like that --\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nwe will simulate\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nspecifically you,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nnot just a generic person,\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nbut what's actually going on inside you.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd in that simulation, what we could do\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nis design for you specifically\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\na sequence of treatments,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nand it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nIt might be things like, don't eat that day,\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nor give them a little chemotherapy,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nmaybe a little radiation.\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nOf course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nBut design a program of treatments specifically for you\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nand help your body\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nguide back to health --\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nguide your body back to health.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nBecause your body will do most of the work of fixing it\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nif we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nWe put it in the equivalent of splints.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nAnd so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nfor fixing cancer,\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nand we just have to prop those up in the right way\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nand get them to do the job.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nAnd so I believe that this will be

I was covering the war in Afghanistan, and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera, the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that. Then, two years later, I covered another war \u2014 the war in Iraq. I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq. And the war ended with a regime change, like the one in Afghanistan. And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship, an authoritarian regime, that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation, within the people themselves. However, the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world.For decades, we have lived under authoritarian regimes \u2014 in the Arab world, in the Middle East. These regimes created something within us during this period. I'm 43 years old right now. For the last 40 years, I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us \u2014 old, aged, authoritarian, corrupt situations \u2014 regimes that we have seen around us. And for a moment I was wondering, are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground, a change that does not come through foreign intervention, through the misery of occupation, through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes? The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein, but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad, they felt that their dignity had suffered. And this is why they revolted. This is why they did not accept. And actually other regimes, they told their citizens, \"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq? Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing? Would you like to see destruction? Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?\" And the people thought for themselves, \"Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in, instead of having the second scenario.\" That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.For 10 years, unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction, images of killing, of sectarian conflicts, images of violence, emerging from a magnificent piece of land, a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived. A new generation, well-educated, connected, inspired by universal values and a global understanding, has created a new reality for us. We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams: these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world, who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing. Just step out of your house, raise your voice and say, \"We would like to see the end of the regime.\"This is what happened in Tunisia. Over a few days, the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies, billions of dollars in maintaining, trying to maintain, its prisons, collapsed, disappeared, because of the voices of the public. People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices, they tried to kill. The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people. They found something called Facebook. They found something called Twitter. They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues. And they said, \"These kids are misled.\" Therefore, they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them, bring them back home. This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda. \"Bring these kids home because they are misled.\" But yes, these youth who have been inspired by universal values, who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and, at the same time, realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it \u2014 not using violence, not trying to create chaos \u2014 these young people, they did not go home. Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years, and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there. But we found that these people in the street, all of them are our reporters, feeding our newsroom with pictures, with videos and with news. And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people \u2014 people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. And then we took that decision: We are unrolling the news. We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people. We are going to spread the message. Yes, some of these young people are connected to the Internet, but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little, is very small, because of many problems that we are suffering from. But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it]. We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world \u2014 and internationally, globally, through our English channel.And then people started to feel that there's something new happening. And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave. And then Egypt started, and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave. And now Libya as you see it. And then you have Yemen. And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, \"How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?\" I want to tell you something, that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset. But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change, before we thought, and governments told us \u2014 and even sometimes it was true \u2014 that change was imposed on us, and people rejected that, because they thought that it is alien to their culture. Always, we believed that change will spring from within, that change should be a reconciliation with culture, cultural diversity, with our faith in our tradition and in our history, but at the same time, open to universal values, connected with the world, tolerant to the outside. And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region.How did the elite deal with that \u2014 the so-called political elite? In front of Facebook, they brought the camels in Tahrir Square. In front of Al Jazeera, they started creating tribalism. And then when they failed, they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world. They started telling the West, \"Be aware of Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories. These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras. Be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization.\" Fortunately, people right now cannot be deceived. Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. They could not, and they cannot, imagine how they could really deal with this reality. They have lost. They have been detached from their people, from the masses, and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other.Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. We do not create revolutions. However, when something of that magnitude happens, we are at the center of the coverage. We were banned from Egypt, and our correspondents, some of them were arrested. But most of our camera people and our journalists, they went underground in Egypt \u2014 voluntarily \u2014 to report what happened in Tahrir Square. For 18 days, our cameras were broadcasting, live, the voices of the people in Tahrir Square. I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone \u2014 ordinary person who I don't know \u2014 from Tahrir Square. He told me, \"We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras. If you switch off the cameras tonight, there will be a genocide. You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square.\" I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them, \"Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night, because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story \u2014 and they feel protected as well.\"So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world. We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world. Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran, of [the] Mosaddeq revolution. Let us free ourselves \u2014 especially in the West \u2014 from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest, or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security. The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction. Let us accept the choice of the people. Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. The future should be ruled by people themselves, even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us. But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world, for the West and the East, to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world, rather than the images of violence and terrorism. Let us support these people. Let us stand for them. And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change, and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance. The future has arrived, and the future is now. I thank you very much.(Applause)Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you. Thank you for coming here. How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened? Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade or something more?Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered. We have covered many wars. We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems, a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region, because we were centered at the middle of it. But this is a story \u2014 it is a great story; it is beautiful. It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident. You are witnessing change in history. You are witnessing the birth of a new era. And this is what the story's all about.CA: There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical, or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now, that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?WK: And people actually, after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime, the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils, they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy, but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational, not to go out of order. In my opinion, these people are much more wiser than, not only the political elite, even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders including political parties. At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old \u2014 including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes.(Applause)CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way. What should people here at TED, here in the West, do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here?WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world \u2014 that people care, people care about this great transformation. Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us, the head of Aljazeera.net, he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world. Fifty percent of it is coming from America. Because we discovered that people care, and people would like to know \u2014 they are receiving the stream through our Internet. Unfortunately in the United States, we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling, of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us.CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community, TEDxCairo, are meeting as we speak. They've had some speakers there. I believe they've heard your talk. Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us. Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 1084, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nTen years ago exactly,\n\n00:00:13.958 -->

given us\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nnew meaning for freedom\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand empowered us to go down to the streets.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nNothing happened. No violence. Nothing.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nJust step out of your house,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nraise your voice\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nand say, \"We would like to see the end of the regime.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThis is what happened in Tunisia.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nOver a few days,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nthe Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nin the security agencies,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nbillions of dollars\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nin maintaining, trying to maintain,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nits prisons,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ncollapsed, disappeared,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbecause of the voices of the public.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nPeople who were inspired to go down to the streets\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand to raise their voices,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthey tried to kill.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThe intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThey found something called Facebook.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThey found something called Twitter.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThey were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd they said,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n\"These kids are misled.\"\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nTherefore, they asked their parents\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nto go down to the streets\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand collect them, bring them back home.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThis is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n\"Bring these kids home\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbecause they are misled.\"\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBut yes,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthese youth\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwho have been inspired\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nby universal values,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nwho are idealistic enough\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nto imagine a magnificent future\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand, at the same time, realistic enough\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto balance this kind of imagination\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand the process leading to it --\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nnot using violence,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nnot trying to create chaos --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthese young people,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nthey did not go home.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nParents actually went to the streets\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand they supported them.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWe in Al Jazeera\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwere banned from Tunisia for years,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand the government did not allow\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nany Al Jazeera reporter to be there.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut we found that these people in the street,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nall of them are our reporters,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nfeeding our newsroom\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nwith pictures, with videos\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand with news.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd suddenly that newsroom in Doha\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nbecame a center\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat received all this kind of input from ordinary people --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\npeople who are connected and people who have ambition\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand who have liberated themselves\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nfrom the feeling of inferiority.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nAnd then we took that decision:\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWe are unrolling the news.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWe are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nWe are going to spread the message.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nYes, some of these young people\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nare connected to the Internet,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut the connectivity in the Arab world\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nis very little, is very small,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbecause of many problems that we are suffering from.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBut Al Jazeera took the voice from these people\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand we amplified [it].\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nWe put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand internationally, globally,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthrough our English channel.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd then people started to feel\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat there's something new happening.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\ndecided to leave.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd then Egypt started,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd now Libya as you see it.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd then you have Yemen.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd you have many other countries trying to see\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand to rediscover that feeling\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nof, \"How do we imagine a future\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nwhich is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?\"\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nI want to tell you something,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat the Internet and connectivity\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nhas created [a] new mindset.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nBut this mindset\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nhas continued to be faithful\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto the soil and to the land\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat it emerged from.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd while this was the major difference\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nbetween many initiatives before\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nto create change,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nbefore we thought, and governments told us --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand even sometimes it was true --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthat change was imposed on us,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand people rejected that,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbecause they thought that it is alien to their culture.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAlways, we believed\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat change will spring from within,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nthat change should be a reconciliation\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nwith culture, cultural diversity,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nwith our faith in our tradition\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand in our history,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nbut at the same time,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nopen to universal values, connected with the world,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\ntolerant to the outside.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd this is the moment\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat is happening right now in the Arab world.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThis is the right moment, and this is the actual moment\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthat we see all of these meanings meet together\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand then create the beginning\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nof this magnificent era\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthat will emerge from the region.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nHow did the elite deal with that --\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthe so-called political elite?\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIn front of Facebook,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthey brought the camels in Tahrir Square.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nIn front of Al Jazeera,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthey started creating tribalism.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd then when they failed,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthey started speaking about conspiracies\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nthat emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nin order to divide the Arab world.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThey started telling the West,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\n\"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAl-Qaeda is taking over our territories.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThese are Islamists\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\ntrying to create new Imaras.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nBe aware of these people\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwho [are] coming to you\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nin order to ruin your great civilization.\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nFortunately,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\npeople right now cannot be deceived.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBecause this corrupt elite\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nin that region\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nhas lost even the power of deception.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThey could not, and they cannot, imagine\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nhow they could really deal with this reality.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThey have lost.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThey have been detached\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nfrom their people, from the masses,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand now we are seeing them collapsing\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\none after the other.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAl Jazeera is not\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\na tool of revolution.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe do not create revolutions.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nHowever,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwhen something of that magnitude happens,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nwe are at the center of the coverage.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nWe were banned from Egypt,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand our correspondents,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nsome of them were arrested.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nBut most of our camera people\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand our journalists,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthey went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nto report what happened in Tahrir Square.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nFor 18 days,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nour cameras were broadcasting, live,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthe voices of the people in Tahrir Square.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI remember one night\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwhen someone phoned me on my cellphone --\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nHe told me, \"We appeal to you\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nnot to switch off the

correspondents there\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand to phone our newsroom\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand to tell them, \"Make your best\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nnot to switch off the cameras at night,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbecause the guys there really feel confident\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nwhen someone is reporting their story --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand they feel protected as well.\"\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nSo we have a chance\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nto create a new future\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nin

open to the world.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nLet us not repeat the mistake of Iran,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nof [the] Mosaddeq revolution.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nLet us free ourselves -- especially in the West --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nfrom thinking about that part of the world\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nbased on oil interest,\n\n00:11:55.958 -->

00:13:41.958\nHow would you characterize the historical significance\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nof what's happened?\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nIs this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nor something more?\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nWadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nWe have covered many wars.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nWe have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\na lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nbecause we were centered at the middle of it.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nBut this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nIt is not something that you only cover\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbecause you have to cover a great incident.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nYou are witnessing change in history.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nYou are witnessing the birth of a new era.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd this is what the story's all about.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nCA: There are a lot of people in the West\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nwho are still skeptical,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nor think this may just be an intermediate stage\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nbefore much more alarming chaos.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nYou really believe\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthat if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthat a government could emerge\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthat espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nWK: And people actually,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nafter the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthe youth who have organized themselves\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nin certain groups and councils,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthey are guarding the transformation\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand they are trying to put it on a track\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nin order to satisfy\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nthe values of democracy,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nbut at the same time\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nalso to make it reasonable\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand to make it rational,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nnot to go out of order.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nIn my opinion, these people are much more wiser\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nthan, not only the political elite,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\neven the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nincluding political parties.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAt this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nare much more wiser\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand capable of creating the change\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nthan the old --\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nincluding the political and cultural\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand ideological\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nold regimes.\n\n00:15:31.958 -->

TED,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nhere in the West,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\ndo if they want to connect or make a difference\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nand they believe in what's happening here?\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nWK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world --\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nthat people care,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\npeople care about this great transformation.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nMohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthe head of
